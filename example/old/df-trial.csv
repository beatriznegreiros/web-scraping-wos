0,Stream order and connectivity affect phosphorus distribution in plain river network,"Lyu, HH","The order and connectivity of streams influence phosphorus distribution extensively. In this work, the space-and-time variabilities of total phosphorus (TP), particulate phosphorus (PP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and dissolved unreactive phosphorus (DUP) in streams of three orders (?, ?, III) were analyzed during each spring of 2016-2018 in a plain river network area, China. The results show that: ? PP was the main form of TP and DRP was the main form of TDP. ? The average concentrations of phosphorus in the order ? streams were significant larger than those in the order III streams. ? The concentrations of TP, PP, TDP, and DRP in the poor-connected streams were considerably higher than those in the well-connected streams. Therefore, it is essential to implement effective practices to improve the protection and appropriate connectivity of small streams in plain river network areas.Show less"
1,"Effect of human activity intensity on stream structure and connectivity in Shaying River Basin, China","Luo, ZL","In order to quantify the relationship between human activity intensity and the evolution of stream structure and connectivity, the characteristics of spatial distribution and temporal evolution of stream structure and connectivity in different periods were studied by using river structure parameters and landscape ecology methods. The results indicate the following. (1) The mainstream trend of stream system, with the stream development coefficient decreased by 18.35% and 22.50% for the second- and third-level of stream, is obvious. (2) Human activity intensity has a significant impact on the change of stream structure and connectivity. Under the background of economy domination, the stronger human intervention is, the simpler streamstructure will be, and the poorer streamconnectivity will be. (3) From the view of time series, it is considered that human activities are the main reasons for affecting the change of stream structure and connectivity in the short term, while the natural factors have little effect. (4) The length of low-level streams is more affected by human activities than that of the high-level streams, but water surface ratio is opposite. This study can provide a reference for coordinating the contradiction between socio-economic development and protection of stream systems.Show less"
2,Southwestern Intermittent and Ephemeral Stream Connectivity,"Goodrich, DC","Ephemeral and intermittent streams are abundant in the arid and semiarid landscapes of the Western and Southwestern United States (U.S.). Connectivity of ephemeral and intermittent streams to the relatively few perennial reaches through runoff is a major driver of the ecohydrology of the region. These streams supply water, sediment, nutrients, and biota to downstream reaches and rivers. In addition, they provide runoff to recharge alluvial and regional groundwater aquifers that support baseflow in perennial mainstem stream reaches over extended periods when little or no precipitation occurs. Episodic runoff, as well as groundwater inflow to surface water in streams support limited naturally occurring riparian communities. This paper provides an overview and comprehensive examination of factors affecting the hydrologic, chemical, and ecological connectivity of ephemeral and intermittent streams on perennial or intermittent rivers in the arid and semiarid Southwestern U.S. Connectivity as influenced and moderated through the physical landscape, climate, and human impacts to downstream waters or rivers is presented first at the broader Southwestern scale, and secondly drawing on a specific and more detailed example of the San Pedro Basin due to its history of extensive observations and research in the basin. A wide array of evidence clearly illustrates hydrologic, chemical, and ecological connectivity of ephemeral and intermittent streams throughout stream networks.Show less"
3,Connectivity in rivers,"Wohl, E","Connectivity describes the degree to which matter and organisms can move among spatially defined units in a natural system. River connectivity is typically described in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dimensions within the river corridor and the watershed and can be conceptualized as a continuum from fully connected to disconnected over diverse temporal and spatial scales. Explicit characterization of connectivity helps understanding of disparities among short-term, local rates of flux and inferred fluxes over larger scales. Connectivity also strongly influences the response of rivers to natural and human disturbances. Investigations of connectivity facilitate the recognition of processes that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries, as well as understanding of nonlinear behavior and retention within rivers. Enhancing the ability to identify, quantify, and predict the processes that create and maintain connectivity is integral to the effective management of rivers.Show less"
4,Mapping longitudinal stream connectivity in the North St. Vrain Creek watershed of Colorado,"Wohl, E","We use reach-scale stream gradient as an indicator of longitudinal connectivity for water, sediment, and organic matter in a mountainous watershed in Colorado. Stream reaches with the highest gradient tend to have narrow valley bottoms with limited storage space and attenuation of downstream fluxes, whereas stream reaches with progressively lower gradients have progressively more storage and greater attenuation. We compared the distribution of stream gradient to stream-reach connectivity rankings that incorporated multiple potential control variables, including lithology, upland vegetation, hydroclimatology, road crossings, and flow diversions. We then assessed connectivity rankings using different weighting schemes against stream gradient and against field based understanding of relative connectivity within the watershed. We conclude that stream gradient, which is simple to map using publicly available data and digital elevation models, is the most robust indicator of relative longitudinal connectivity within the river network.

5,The impact of dams on the river connectivity of the two largest river basins in China,"Yi, YJ","Dams are built on rivers for power generation, flood prevention and control, and water resources utilization. However, dams also reduce the connectivity of rivers, which hinders the exchange of material and organisms within rivers. The Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin are the two largest river basins in China. In this study, the connectivity of these two huge and highly impacted systems was investigated. The Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) was applied to evaluate the impact on river connectivity of dams with a reservoir capacity of larger than 0.1 km(3). The results show that river connectivity decreased following an increase in dam construction. The connectivity of the Yangtze River Basin was close to 80 (0 is completely disconnected and 100 is connectivity under natural condition) in the 1980s, but declined significantly after the Gezhouba Dam was constructed on the mainstream of the Yangtze River. From 1980 to 2010, the connectivity of the Yellow River Basin was always lower than that of the Yangtze River Basin. The changes in the connectivity indices of potamodromous fish (DCIp) and diadromous fish (DCId) were determined for the period of 1980-2010. In the Yangtze River Basin, the DCIp decreased by 67.28% and the DCId decreased by 65.72%. In the Yellow River Basin, the DCIp decreased by 43.8% and the DCId decreased by 100%. In conclusion, the construction of dams, especially those on the main stream, has reduced the connectivity of the basin. The connectivity of the Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin has been severely affected.Show less"
6,River-stream connectivity affects fish bioassessment performance,"Hitt, NP","Stream fish bioassessment methods assume that fish assemblages observed in sample sites reflect responses to local stressors, but fish assemblages are influenced by local factors as well as regional dispersal to and from connected streams. We hypothesized that fish movement to and from refugia and source populations in connected rivers (i.e., riverine dispersal) would weaken or decouple relations between fish community metrics and local environmental conditions. We compared fish-environment relations between streams that flow into large rivers (mainstem tributaries) and streams that lack riverine confluences (headwater tributaries) at multiple spatial grains using data from the USEPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in the mid-Atlantic highlands, USA (n = 157 sites). Headwater and mainstem tributaries were not different in local environmental conditions, but showed important differences in fish metric responses to environmental quality gradients. Stream sites flowing into mainstem channels within 10 fluvial km showed consistently weaker relations to local environmental conditions than stream sites that lacked such mainstem connections. Moreover, these patterns diminished at longer distances from riverine confluences, consistent with the hypothesis of riverine dispersal. Our results suggest that (1) the precision of fish bioassessment metrics may be improved by calibrating scoring criteria based on the spatial position of sites within stream networks and (2) the spatial grain of fish bioassessment studies may be manipulated to suit objectives by including or excluding fishes exhibiting riverine dispersal.Show less"
7,Changes in river connectivity indexes in the lower Yellow River between 1960 and 2015,"Chen, Y","Channel connectivity in the lower Yellow River has changed in recent decades as a result of climate change and human activities. Developing indexes that can be used to assess channel connectivity is a key issue in the lower Yellow River and beyond. We propose a suite of connectivity indexes based on several components of a river channel, including boundary, flow, and sediment indicators. Through an analysis of river connectivity over time in the lower Yellow River, we found that a decrease in precipitation was the main cause of poor river connectivity conditions in the 1990s. Since 1999, the year of impoundment of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, river connectivity has improved, as shown by boundary, sediment, and ecology indexes, as a result of reservoir operation and regulation. However, water diversion may increase channel sedimentation, leading to a decline in sediment connectivity. The suite of river connectivity indexes developed in this paper and applied to the Yellow River can be used in similar sediment-laden streams in other semiarid regions worldwide.Show less"
8,Change of stream network connectivity and its impact on flood control,"Gao, YQ","Urbanization can alter the hydrogeomorphology of streams and rivers, change stream network structures, and reduce stream network connectivity, which leads to a decrease in the storage capacity of stream networks and aggravates flood damage. Therefore, investigation of the ways in which stream network connectivity impacts flood storage capacity and flood control in urbanized watersheds can provide significant benefits. This study developed a framework to assess stream network connectivity and its impact on flood control. First, a few connectivity indices were adopted to assess longitudinal stream network connectivity. Afterward, the static and dynamic storage capacities of stream networks were evaluated using storage capacity indices and a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Finally, the impact of stream network connectivity change on flood control was assessed by investigating the changes in stream network connectivity and storage capacity. This framework was applied to the Qinhuai River Basin, China, where intensive urbanization has occurred in the last few decades. The results show that stream network storage capacity is affected by stream network connectivity. Increasing stream network connectivity enhances stream network storage capacity.

9,Physical and Chemical Connectivity of Streams and Riparian Wetlands to Downstream Waters: A Synthesis,"Fritz, KM","Streams, riparian areas, floodplains, alluvial aquifers, and downstream waters (e.g., large rivers, lakes, and oceans) are interconnected by longitudinal, lateral, and vertical fluxes of water, other materials, and energy. Collectively, these interconnected waters are called fluvial hydrosystems. Physical and chemical connectivity within fluvial hydrosystems is created by the transport of nonliving materials (e.g., water, sediment, nutrients, and contaminants) which either do or do not chemically change (chemical and physical connections, respectively). A substantial body of evidence unequivocally demonstrates physical and chemical connectivity between streams and riparian wetlands and downstream waters. Streams and riparian wetlands are structurally connected to downstream waters through the network of continuous channels and floodplain form that make these systems physically contiguous, and the very existence of these structures provides strong geomorphologic evidence for connectivity. Functional connections between streams and riparian wetlands and their downstream waters vary geographically and over time, based on proximity, relative size, environmental setting, material disparity, and intervening units. Because of the complexity and dynamic nature of connections among fluvial hydrosystem units, a complete accounting of the physical and chemical connections and their consequences to downstream waters should aggregate over multiple years to decades.Show less"
10,Hydrological controls on river network connectivity,"Garbin, S","This study proposes a probabilistic approach for the quantitative assessment of reach-and network-scale hydrological connectivity as dictated by river flow space-time variability. Spatial dynamics of daily streamflows are estimated based on climatic and morphological features of the contributing catchment, integrating a physically based approach that accounts for the stochasticity of rainfall with a water balance framework and a geomorphic recession flow analysis. Ecologically meaningful minimum stage thresholds are used to evaluate the connectivity of individual stream reaches, and other relevant network-scale connectivity metrics. The framework allows a quantitative description of the main hydrological causes and the ecological consequences of water depth dynamics experienced by river networks. The analysis shows that the spatial variability of local-scale hydrological connectivity is strongly affected by the spatial and temporal distribution of climatic variables. Depending on the underlying climatic settings and the critical stage threshold, loss of connectivity can be observed in the headwaters or along the main channel, thereby originating a fragmented river network. The proposed approach provides important clues for understanding the effect of climate on the ecological function of river corridors.Show less"
11,Hydrologic connectivity and the contribution of stream headwaters to ecological integrity at regional scales,"Freeman, MC","Cumulatively, headwater streams contribute to maintaining hydrologic connectivity and ecosystem integrity at regional scales. Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Headwater streams compose over two-thirds of total stream length in a typical river drainage and directly connect the upland and riparian landscape to the rest of the stream ecosystem. Altering headwater streams, e.g., by channelization, diversion through pipes, impoundment and burial, modifies fluxes between uplands and downstream river segments and eliminates distinctive habitats. The large-scale ecological effects of altering headwaters are amplified by land uses that alter runoff and nutrient loads to streams, and by widespread dam construction on larger rivers (which frequently leaves free-flowing upstream portions of river systems essential to sustaining aquatic biodiversity). We discuss three examples of large-scale consequences of cumulative headwater alteration. Downstream eutrophication and coastal hypoxia result, in part, from agricultural practices that alter headwaters and wetlands while increasing nutrient runoff. Extensive headwater alteration is also expected to lower secondary productivity of river systems by reducing stream-system length and trophic subsidies to downstream river segments, affecting aquatic communities and terrestrial wildlife that utilize aquatic resources. Reduced viability of freshwater biota may occur with cumulative headwater alteration, including for species that occupy a range of stream sizes but for which headwater streams diversify the network of interconnected populations or enhance survival for particular life stages. Developing a more predictive understanding of ecological patterns that may emerge on regional scales as a result of headwater alterations will require studies focused on components and pathways that connect headwaters to river, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Linkages between headwaters and downstream ecosystems cannot be discounted when addressing large-scale issues such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and global losses of biodiversity.Show less"
12,Modelling functional fish habitat connectivity in rivers: A case study for prioritizing restoration actions targeting brown trout,"Roy, ML","1. Throughout the world, decreased connectivity of fluvial habitats caused by artificial river channel alterations such as culverts, weirs and dykes is seen as an important threat to the long-term survival of many aquatic species. In addition to assessing habitat quality and abundance, wildlife managers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of taking into account habitat connectivity when setting priorities for restoration. In this paper, a new approach of spatial analysis adapted to rivers and streams is proposed for modelling 2D functional habitat connectivity, integrating distance, costs and risk of travelling between habitat patches (e.g. daily use, spawning, refuge) for particular fish species, size classes and life stages.2. This approach was applied to a case study in which brown trout (Salmo trutta) habitat accessibility was examined and compared under various scenarios of stream restoration in a highly fragmented stream in Ile-de-France. Probabilities of reaching spawning habitats were estimated from a trout-populated area located downstream of the barriers and from potential daily-use habitat patches across the stream segment.3. The approach successfully helped prioritize restoration actions by identifying options that yield the greatest increase in accessible spawning habitat areas and connectivity between spawning habitat and daily-use habitat patches. This case study illustrates the practical use of the approach and the software in the context of river habitat management.Show less"
13,A novel method to evaluate stream connectivity using trail cameras,"Bellucci, CJ","Stream connectivity is important for the ecological health of the stream and downstream waters. In this study, we use the term stream connectivity to mean hydrologically connected pools and riffles that link stream habitat along a longitudinal continuum (upstream to downstream), while also recognizing the lateral dimension (connection to flood plain) and vertical connection to groundwater. There are thousands of man-made structures (i.e. dams, culverts, surface and groundwater withdrawal locations) in Connecticut which negatively impact stream connectivity and can result in aquatic habitat fragmentation. Cost-effective techniques are needed to assess human alteration to streams in order to prioritize management actions to restore stream connectivity. We developed a method to characterize stream connectivity using commercially available trail cameras that cost less than approximately $500 per deployment. We developed a six-category system to describe the variations in stream connectivity observed using the trail camera images. We then used the categorical data to calculate metrics that quantify stream connectivity. To pilot this approach, we evaluated reference locations with minimal anthropogenic influence on stream connectivity in comparison with stream reaches likely to be impacted by nearby groundwater wells. We found that metrics derived from trail camera images were useful to quantify stream connectivity. We anticipate that the methods outlined herein is a useful stream connectivity assessment tool that can be effectively communicated to scientists and non-scientists.

14,MEASURING LONGITUDINAL RIVER NETWORK CONNECTIVITY,"Branco, P",
15,How Hydrologic Connectivity Regulates Water Quality in River Corridors,"Harvey, J","Downstream flow in rivers is repeatedly delayed by hydrologic exchange with off-channel storage zones where biogeochemical processing occurs. We present a dimensionless metric that quantifies river connectivity as the balance between downstream flow and the exchange of water with the bed, banks, and floodplains. The degree of connectivity directly influences downstream water quality - too little connectivity limits the amount of river water exchanged and leads to biogeochemically inactive water storage, while too much connectivity limits the contact time with sediments for reactions to proceed. Using a metric of reaction significance based on river connectivity, we provide evidence that intermediate levels of connectivity, rather than the highest or lowest levels, are the most efficient in removing nitrogen from Northeastern United States' rivers. Intermediate connectivity balances the frequency, residence time, and contact volume with reactive sediments, which can maximize the reactive processing of dissolved contaminants and the protection of downstream water quality. Our simulations suggest denitrification dominantly occurs in riverbed hyporheic zones of streams and small rivers, whereas vertical turbulent mixing in contact with sediments dominates in mid-size to large rivers. The metrics of connectivity and reaction significance presented here can facilitate scientifically based prioritizations of river management strategies to protect the values and functions of river corridors.Show less"
16,Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to Downstream Waters: An Integrated Systems Framework,"Leibowitz, SG","Interest in connectivity has increased in the aquatic sciences, partly because of its relevance to the Clean Water Act. This paper has two objectives: (1) provide a framework to understand hydrological, chemical, and biological connectivity, focusing on how headwater streams and wetlands connect to and contribute to rivers; and (2) briefly review methods to quantify hydrological and chemical connectivity. Streams and wetlands affect river structure and function by altering material and biological fluxes to the river; this depends on two factors: (1) functions within streams and wetlands that affect material fluxes; and (2) connectivity (or isolation) from streams and wetlands to rivers that allows (or prevents) material transport between systems. Connectivity can be described in terms of frequency, magnitude, duration, timing, and rate of change. It results from physical characteristics of a system, e.g., climate, soils, geology, topography, and the spatial distribution of aquatic components. Biological connectivity is also affected by traits and behavior of the biota. Connectivity can be altered by human impacts, often in complex ways. Because of variability in these factors, connectivity is not constant but varies over time and space. Connectivity can be quantified with field-based methods, modeling, and remote sensing. Further studies using these methods are needed to classify and quantify connectivity of aquatic ecosystems and to understand how impacts affect connectivity.Show less"
17,Increasing floodplain connectivity through urban stream restoration increases nutrient and sediment retention,"McMillan, SK","Stream restoration practices frequently aim to increase connectivity between the stream channel and its floodplain to improve channel stability and enhance water quality through sediment trapping and nutrient retention. To measure the effectiveness of restoration and to understand the drivers of these functional responses, we monitored five restored urban streams that represent a range of channel morphology and restoration ages. High and low elevation floodplain plots were established in triplicate in each stream to capture variation in floodplain connectivity. We measured ecosystem geomorphic and soil attributes, sediment and nutrient loading, and rates of soil nutrient biogeochemistry processes (denitrification; N and P mineralization) then used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify controls on sedimentation and nutrient processing. Local channel and floodplain morphology and position within the river network controlled connectivity with increased sedimentation at sites downstream of impaired reaches and at floodplain plots near the stream channel and at low elevations. We observed that nitrogen loading (both dissolved and particulate) was positively correlated with denitrification and N mineralization and dissolved phosphate loading positively influenced P mineralization; however, none of these input rates or transformations differed between floodplain elevation categories. Instead, continuous gradients of connectivity were observed rather than categorical shifts between inset and high floodplains. Organic matter and nutrient content in floodplain soils increased with the time since restoration, which highlights the importance of recovery time after construction that is needed for restored systems to increase ecosystem functions. Our results highlight the importance of restoring floodplains downstream of sources of impairment and building them at lower elevations so they flood frequently, not just during bankfull events. This integrated approach has the greatest potential for increasing trapping of sediment, nutrients, and associated pollutants in restored streams and thereby improving water quality in urban watersheds.Show less"
18,"Simulation of dynamic expansion, contraction, and connectivity in a mountain stream network","Ward, AS","Headwater stream networks expand and contract in response to changes in stream discharge. The changes in the extent of the stream network are also controlled by geologic or geomorphic setting - some reaches go dry even under relatively wet conditions, other reaches remain flowing under relatively dry conditions. While such patterns are well recognized, we currently lack tools to predict the extent of the stream network and the times and locations where the network is dry within large river networks. Here, we develop a perceptual model of the river corridor in a headwater mountainous catchment, translate this into a reduced-complexity mechanistic model, and implement the model to examine connectivity and network extent over an entire water year. Our model agreed reasonably well with our observations, showing that the extent and connectivity of the river network was most sensitive to hydrologic forcing under the lowest discharges (Q(gauge) < 1 L s(-1)), that at intermediate discharges (1 L s(-1) < Q(gauge) < 10 L s(-1)) the extent of the network changed dramatically with changes in discharge, and that under wet conditions (Q(gauge) > 10 L s(-1)) the extent of the network was relatively insensitive to hydrologic forcing and was instead determined by the network topology. We do not expect that the specific thresholds observed in this study would be transferable to other catchments with different geology, topology, or hydrologic forcing. However, we expect that the general pattern should be robust: the dominant controls will shift from hydrologic forcing to geologic setting as discharge increases. Furthermore, our method is readily transferable as the model can be applied with minimal data requirements (a single stream gauge, a digital terrain model, and estimates of hydrogeologic properties) to estimate flow duration or connectivity along the river corridor in unstudied catchments. As the available information increases, the model could be better calibrated to match site-specific observations of network extent, locations of dry reaches, or solute break through curves as demonstrated in this study. Based on the low initial data requirements and ability to later tune the model to a specific site, we suggest example applications of this parsimonious model that may prove useful to both researchers and managers.

19,Trade-offs among road-stream crossing upgrade prioritizations based on connectivity restoration and erosion risk control,"Lin, HY","Prioritizing projects to improve cost-effectiveness has become a common practice in natural resources management, especially in selecting sites for river restoration work. Previous studies for prioritizing road-stream crossing upgrade projects focused on either restoring river connectivity or reducing sedimentation, even though crossings can affect connectivity and sedimentation simultaneously. In this study, we simulated site selection to maximize the improvement of connectivity restoration and sedimentation reduction of three prioritization schemes targeting (a) river connectivity, (b) erosion risk, or (c) both objectives concurrently and compared the results. Furthermore, we examined the relationships between the cost-effectiveness of prioritizations and watershed characteristics. We found significant differences among the effectiveness of prioritization objectives; thus, trade-offs should be taken into consideration when prioritizing crossings. The incorporation of spatial interdependency among crossings and weighting objectives could significantly change the cost-effectiveness. We also found that splitting the budget and using a portion to individually prioritize each objective could be more cost-effective than using the whole budget to achieve concurrent objectives. Watershed characteristics like size and connectivity- and sedimentation-related factors could be used to help identify effective management for both connectivity restoration and sedimentation control.Show less"
20,Commonalities in stream connectivity restoration alternatives: an attempt to simplify barrier removal optimization,"McManamay, RA","Movement within stream corridors is a basic life history requirement of many aquatic organisms. Barrier removal in streams has become a common practice in the United States aimed to restore organism dispersal and meet conservation objectives; however, there are social and economic costs to the removal of barriers. Accordingly, tools to prioritize barrier removal, particularly optimization techniques, can be used to evaluate cost-benefit trade-offs. Many of these techniques, however, require programming experience and are not available to natural resource managers. Furthermore, conservation objectives vary considerably depending on the life histories of organisms under consideration, and these opposing objectives, in conjunction with variant socioeconomic costs, will influence optimization solutions, specifically which barriers to remove. To promote the use of optimization tools, straightforward and open-access platforms are needed to support use by managers, while also providing general approaches for holistic basin-scale connectivity restoration. Herein, we use two case studies, White Oak Creek (small watershed) and the Roanoke River Basin (large basin), to explore the divergent outcomes stemming from different conservation objectives and socioeconomic costs used to prioritize barrier removal. We conducted optimization modeling using a widely accessible platform along with an open-access solver plug-in to support a wide variety of conservation objectives. We used simple approaches to find commonalities in barriers identified for removal among divergent conservation objectives and provide alternative (i.e., hybrid removal-passage) strategies for approaching habitat restoration for diverse aquatic communities while increasing social benefits (i.e., hydropower energy). As expected, different conservation objectives aimed to support varied species life histories (e.g., diadromy, large-river vs. small-river potamodromy) have very different effects on optimization solutions. In both case studies, however, commonalities in solutions were identified through clustering groups of barriers into general connectivity restoration strategies. Furthermore, strategy types for a given barrier could be predicted with >= 72% accuracy using only four metrics. This suggests that optimization results can be simplified into general standards to support adoption of sustainable basin connectivity criteria strategies. Our framework provides a flexible and open-access approach to conduct relatively complex optimization modeling for stream barrier prioritization, while examining potential for agreement among divergence conservation objectives.Show less"
21,River network connectivity and fish diversity,"Shao, XJ","Frequent and severe disruptions of natural river flows associated with human activities significantly alter hydrological connectivity in large river networks, with deleterious effects on fish diversity. Understanding the relationship between fish diversity and river network connectivity is fundamental to ensuring species persistence, ecosystem integrity, and human well-being. Here, we provide a review of the mechanisms by which river network connectivity (RNC) affects fish diversity. We review the relationships between forms, systems and types of RNC and fish diversity, based on more than 100 previous studies. In summary, sustaining RNC promotes fish diversity in longitudinal and lateral axes, and species sorting, dispersal dynamics, and habitat availability are the main factors driving the distribution of fish diversity, followed by nutrition and trophic dynamics. Our work highlights the effects of RNC on fish diversity, and provides a mechanistic understanding of how RNC affects fish diversity across river basins, thus providing scientific guidance for protecting fish biodiversity and improving the health of liver network ecosystems.

22,Prioritizing barrier removal to improve functional connectivity of rivers,"Branco, P","1. Freshwater systems are severely impacted by connectivity reduction due to the construction of dams and weirs. The breach of this longitudinal connectivity imperils freshwater fish species world-wide. There is thus an increasing need for numerical tools that help decision-makers correctly allocate resources to prioritize restoration actions.2. This study provides a methodology for prioritizing the removal of barriers. It is based on spatial graphs, which represent structural units as nodes and relationships between nodes as links, and uses habitat suitability modelling (Boosted Regression Trees) to weight nodes. To exemplify the application of this procedure, we used the Tagus River network and evaluated the impact of the dams (29 built between 1928 and 2004) on the occurrence of each of two fish species (Iberian barbel Luciobarbus bocagei - representing large potamodromous fish; and southern Iberian chub Squalius pyrenaicus - representing small water-column residents) and on the combination of both.3. Results show that dam construction on the Tagus was responsible for a 48.4-54.4% reduction in river connectivity for different fish species. Actions to promote connectivity in just seven of the dams would increase connectivity by 35.0-37.2%.4. The removal of a single barrier chosen through prioritization had a greater overall connectivity increase than the random removal of seven barriers.5. Synthesis and applications. The proposed prioritization method, using spatial graphs and habitat suitability modelling, makes it possible to model the impact of the removal or placement of an insurmountable barrier on the overall functional connectivity of a river network, facilitating resource allocation and minimizing the impact of new barrier implementation.Show less"
23,A new measure of longitudinal connectivity for stream networks,"Cote, D","Habitat connectivity is a central factor in shaping aquatic biological communities, but few tools exist to describe and quantify this attribute at a network scale in riverine systems. Here, we develop a new index to quantify longitudinal connectivity of river networks based on the expected probability of an organism being able to move freely between two random points of the network. We apply this index to two fish life histories and evaluate the effects of the number, passability, and placement of barriers on river network connectivity through the use of simulated dendritic ecological networks. We then extend the index to a real world dendritic river system in Newfoundland, Canada. Our results indicate that connectivity in river systems, as represented by our index, is most impacted by the first few barriers added to the system. This is in contrast to terrestrial systems, which are more resilient to low levels of connectivity. The results show a curvilinear relationship between barrier passability and structural connectivity. This suggests that an incremental improvement in passability would result in a greater improvement to river network connectivity for more permeable barriers than for less permeable barriers. Our analysis of the index in simulated and real river networks also showed that barrier placement played an important role in connectivity. Not surprisingly, barriers located near the river mouth have the greatest impact on fish with diadromous life histories while those located near the center of the river network have the most impact on fish with potadromous life histories. The proposed index is conceptually simple and sufficiently flexible to deal with variations in river structure and biological communities. The index will enable researchers to account for connectivity in habitat studies and will also allow resource managers to characterize watersheds, assess cumulative impacts of multiple barriers and determine priorities for restoration.Show less"
24,The social connectivity of urban rivers,"Kondolf, GM","By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other riversfor hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation.The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers similar to 50 to similar to 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over similar to 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaldng in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity.In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
25,EFFECTS OF ROAD CROSSINGS ON HABITAT CONNECTIVITY FOR STREAM-RESIDENT FISH,"Diebel, MW","Road crossings can act as barriers to the movement of stream fishes, resulting in habitat fragmentation, reduced population resilience to environmental disturbance and higher risks of extinction. Strategic barrier removal has the potential to improve connectivity in stream networks, but managers lack a consistent framework for determining which projects will most benefit target species. The objective of this study is to develop a method for identifying and prioritizing action on road crossings in order to restore stream network connectivity. We demonstrate the method using a case study from the Pine-Popple watershed in Wisconsin. First, we propose a new metric for quantifying stream connectivity status for stream-resident fish. The metric quantifies the individual and cumulative effects of barriers on reach and watershed level connectivity, while accounting for natural barriers, distance-based dispersal limitations and variation in habitat type and quality. We conducted a comprehensive field survey of road crossings in the watershed to identify barriers and estimate replacement costs. Of the 190 surveyed road crossings, 74% were determined to be barriers to the movement of at least one species or life stage of fish, primarily due to high water velocity, low water depth or outlet drops. The results of the barrier removal prioritization show that initial projects targeted for mitigation create much greater improvements in connectivity per unit cost than later projects. Benefit-cost curves from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate potential projects within and among watersheds and minimize overall expenditures for specified restoration targets.

26,The science of connected ecosystems: What is the role of catchment-scale connectivity for healthy river ecology?,"Fuller, IC","Riverine biological communities are highly resilient to extreme flood and/or drying disturbance regimes that would otherwise be destructive because these organisms can recolonise from upstream, floodplain, or hyporheic refugia when suitable conditions return. Healthy rivers require a high degree of connectivity to support complex life cycles of many lotic organisms and associated ecosystem functioning. Similarly, connectivity is required for appropriate geophysical functioning; permitting flux of water and sediment that drives channel-forming and ecological processes. Ecological and geophysical processes have operated in this temporal and spatial patchwork of disturbance and recovery pre-Anthropocene. Human impacts are increasing constraints on river and floodplain connectivity, severing many natural pathways, and degrading river ecosystem functioning. River restoration seeks to re-establish some of those biological and physical connections to enhance some level of system health. However, increasing sediment connectivity may be detrimental to river health in some instances. Strongly connected catchments can transmit excessive quantities of sediment from inappropriate land management, detrimental invasive species can spread more widely, and many ecosystem processes can exceed positive feedback control. Simply restoring connectivity will not necessarily lead to healthy river ecosystems. River management requires a greater understanding of how and when connectivity can and should be restored. Although current thinking is often that greater connectivity is better, we illustrate with examples from New Zealand rivers that this is not always the case. The benefits and costs of maintaining or restoring river connectivity need to be given as much attention as the restoration and maintenance of river systems per se.Show less"
27,Hydrologic connectivity driven natural stream fish assemblages in mountain streams in the Yangtze River basin: implications for stream fish conservation in monsoonal East Asia,"He, DK","The East Asian monsoon and related seasonal rain belts are assumed to be significantly variable at intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales, and largely determine the hydrology and ecological processes of the streams and rivers in this region. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation in fish assemblages and the relative importance of local habitat and regional landscape variables in two protected streams in the middle Yangtze River basin. We hypothesized that the stream fish assemblages in this area are strongly influenced by the monsoon climate, and display a spatiotemporal variation in response to changes of stream flow regimes and physical habitats. The results show that species richness and abundance varied with both season and stream size. The distance to the downstream confluence site was the top important environmental factor, followed by altitude and downstream link. The results suggest that the fish assemblages within this protected watershed are mainly affected by regional landscape variables such as longitudinal position and stream position, but less by local habitat variables including water temperature and habitat types. The study highlights the importance of tributary connectivity and continuity to stream fish diversity in this area, indicating that restoration activities should preferentially recover the connectivity between upstream and downstream.Show less"
28,Biodiversity of floodplain river ecosystems: Ecotones and connectivity,"Ward, JV","A high level of spatio-temporal heterogeneity makes riverine floodplains among the most species-rich environments known. Fluvial dynamics from flooding pray a major role in maintaining a diversity of lentic, lotic and semi-aquatic habitat types, each represented by a diversity of successional stages. Ecotones (transition zones between adjacent patches) and connectivity (the strength of interactions across ecotones) are structural and functional elements that result from and contribute to the spatio-temporal dynamics of riverine ecosystems. In floodplain rivers, ecotones and their adjoining patches are arrayed in hierarchical series across a range of scales. At a coarse scale of resolution, fringing floodplains are themselves complex ecotones between river channels and uplands. At finer scales, patches of various types and sizes form habitat and microhabitat diversity patterns. A broad spatio-temporal perspective, including patterns and processes across scales, is needed in order to gain insight into riverine biodiversity. We propose a hierarchical framework for examining diversity patterns in floodplain rivers.Various river management schemes disrupt the interactions that structure ecotones and alter the connectivity across transition zones. Such disruptions occur both within and between hierarchical levels, invariably leading to reductions in biodiversity. Species richness data from the connected and disconnected floodplains of the Austrian Danube illustrate this clearly. In much of the world, species-rich riverine/floodplain environments exist only as isolated fragments across the landscape. In many large rivers, these islands of biodiversity are endangered ecosystems. The fluvial dynamics that formed them have been severely altered. Without ecologically sound restoration of disturbance regimes and connectivity, these remnants of biodiversity will proceed on unidirectional trajectories toward senescence, without rejuvenation. Principles of ecosystem management are necessary to sustain biodiversity in fragmented riverine floodplains. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
29,Constraints on recovery: using molecular methods to study connectivity of aquatic biota in rivers and streams,"Hughes, JM","1. The 'Field of Dreams Hypothesis' states 'if we build it, they will come', referring to the assumption that if habitats are restored, species will recolonise them. However, the ability of a species to recolonise a restored site will depend not only on the appropriate habitat being present, but also on the ability to get there. This is likely to depend on both the species' dispersal behaviour and the position of a site in the landscape.2. Animals with good potential for dispersal are more likely to be able to disperse to newly restored sites. Similarly, sites in lowland streams with limited altitudinal differences between sites may be easier to reach than upstream sites. This is because upstream sites are connected to one another via lowland streams that have different characteristics and therefore may be difficult for animals to traverse.3. In this paper, genetic data from a range of freshwater species that have been analysed in my laboratory are used to assess the importance of life cycle and position in the landscape (i.e. upland versus lowland streams) on connectivity patterns (and thus recolonisation potential) among populations.4. In general, contemporary dispersal across catchment boundaries is negligible, except for aquatic insects with an adult flight stage. Dispersal among streams within catchments appears to be more limited than was predicted from knowledge on life histories, except for fish in lowland rivers and streams.5. As predicted, dispersal of fish, crustaceans and molluscs among streams within catchments is significantly greater in lowland rivers than in upland streams.6. Overall, these analyses suggest that, with the exception of most insects, and fishes in lowland rivers, natural recolonisation of restored sites is only likely from sites within the same stream. If a species has disappeared from the whole stream, then restoration of habitat alone may not be sufficient for its re-establishment.Show less"
30,ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE SENSOR ARRAYS AS A MEANS TO QUANTIFY LONGITUDINAL CONNECTIVITY OF RIVERS,"Jaeger, KL","Electrical resistance sensors are used as a novel approach to quantify streamflow continuity (continuous through time) and longitudinal connectivity (continuous through space) across watersheds in south-eastern Arizona, USA. We demonstrate this approach by reporting on a spatial array of 21 sensors installed in streams supporting naturally perennial, intermittent and ephemeral flow on the US Army Garrison, Fort Huachuca. Continuity and connectivity were quantified based on a strict interpretation of continuous flow at an individual sensor (strict continuity) or simultaneous streamflow at multiple sensors (strict connectivity). In addition, we evaluated continuity and connectivity to include periods (<48?h) when in-channel refuges may exist between streamflow events (refuge-maintained continuity and connectivity). Continuous streamflow in intermittent reaches accounted for 34% of the 121-day monitoring period (15 April13 August 2010) and 28% of the summer monsoon period (1 July13 August 2010). Streamflow in ephemeral reaches accounted for 1.5% and 2.3% of the entire monitoring and monsoon period, respectively. Canyon-wide longitudinal connectivity was rare (<1%); however, substantial longitudinal connection occurred along extensive portions of individual canyons. The refuge-maintained criteria increased continuity 28%, with less influence on connectivity (e.g. <3% increase in only some portions of canyons). Despite this result, the refuge-maintained concept remains important because of its broad applicability to refuge persistence across aquatic species and hydro-climatic regimes. The approach presented in this study supports the growing scientific research on the influence of longitudinal hydrologic connectivity on population dynamics and ecological processes in dendritic river networks.

31,Distribution patterns of macroinvertebrate communities in a Chinese floodgate-regulated river and their relationships with river longitudinal connectivity,"Chi, SY","In this study, the Li River and the middle-lower reaches of the Shaying River in the Shaying River basin were selected for an investigation on the effects of floodgates on macroinvertebrate communities; additionally, the relationships among floodgates, macroinvertebrate communities and river longitudinal connectivity were explored. The Li and Shaying rivers had similar ratios of molluscs and saapers, but their species compositions were significantly different. The water level fluctuations in the Li River were based on natural hydrological characteristics, and these were very different from the fluctuations in the reaches of the Shaying River that were divided by a serious of floodgates. The effects of floodgates resulted in a reduction in the number of taxa, Shannon-Wiener index, Margalef index, and Fisher index and an increase in the Harrison index. The upper reaches of the Li and Saying rivers had similar macroinvertebrate communities, but these were very different from the lower reaches of the Saying River. The total number of species and the number of aquatic insect species increased with the river connectivity gradient and the variations in the alpha-diversity and beta-diversity indices along reaches confirmed the hypothesis that the longitudinal connectivity of the Shaying River was significantly affected by floodgates. The results of Pearson and PLS tests showed that some plankton variables and physical water parameters could possibly describe how the gradient of river longitudinal connectivity was related to the floodgates in the Shaying River basin. The results of partial correlations showed, even when excluding the effects of water pollution, the protozoa richness and electrical conductivity still had significant influences on the distribution patterns of macroinvertebrate communities. When considering the results of correlation analyses and regression together, these same variables could be used to describe how the gradient of river longitudinal hydrological connectivity is related to floodgates in future studies.

33,Barrier-based Longitudinal Connectivity Index for Managing Urban Rivers,"Li, HY","A large variety of barriers can affect longitudinal connectivity, which leads to shipping blocking and even flood hazard. However, few existing methods can quantify physically the river channel connectivity from the barrier's details perspective in a watershed. This paper establishes a new model of the River Channel Connectivity Index (RCCI) to quantify the unobstructed degree of river flow in river channels within geographic information system (GIS ) platforms based on the modified concept of time accessibility. A comprehensive classification system of barriers is setup before these barriers are identified by the remote sensing technology. The model is applied to Dashi Watershed in suburban Beijing, China. Results show that submersible bridges and sediment siltation are the main barriers in the watershed. RCCI values in the mountainous areas are generally higher than that of the plains. The assessment results verified by two historical flood events show that the RCCI can reveal where the river channel connectivity is impaired, how serious it is, and what the reason is for managers. Through scenarios' results, the best restoration measure for each tributary is obtained from the perspective of reducing flood hazards. The new RCCI method not only has methodological significance, but also helps policymakers to enhance river flooding reduction and determine restoration priorities of the river channel.Show less"
34,Towards the assessment of sediment connectivity in a large Himalayan river basin,"Mishra, K","Sediment connectivity, defined as the degree of linkage between the sediment sources to downstream areas, is one of the most important properties that control landscape evolution in river basins. The degree of linkages amongst different parts of a catchment depends mainly on the hinterland characteristics (e.g. catchment morphology, slope, shape, relief, and elevation), channel characteristics (e.g. slope, stream network density, valley confinement), and the combined effects of vegetation (e.g. land use changes and land abandonment). This paper evaluates the sediment connectivity of the upper Kosi basin covering an area of similar to 52,731 km(2) including Tibet and Nepal at different spatial scales. We have computed the index of connectivity (IC) using the equations originally proposed by Borselli et al. (2008) andmodified by Cavalli et al. (2013) to evaluate the potential connection of sediment source areas to the primary channel network as well to the catchment outlet. Our results highlight significant spatial variability in sediment connectivity across the basin and provide important insights on structural sediment dynamics in a complex geological and geomorphological setting. We compare our results with the observed sediment load data at certain outlets and demonstrate that sediment flux in different subbasins is controlled by variable slope distribution and land use and land cover that are strongly related to the structural connectivity. We argue that IC model can be extremely beneficial to understand sediment dynamics at catchment scale in a large river basin (similar to 10(3)-10(4) km(2) scale), where systematic field investigations for mapping hillslope-channel linkages are not feasible.

35,Featured Collection Introduction: Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to Downstream Waters,"Alexander, LC","Connectivity is a fundamental but highly dynamic property of watersheds. Variability in the types and degrees of aquatic ecosystem connectivity presents challenges for researchers and managers seeking to accurately quantify its effects on critical hydrologic, biogeochemical, and biological processes. However, protecting natural gradients of connectivity is key to protecting the range of ecosystem services that aquatic ecosystems provide. In this featured collection, we review the available evidence on connections and functions by which streams and wetlands affect the integrity of downstream waters such as large rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries. The reviews in this collection focus on the types of waters whose protections under the U.S. Clean Water Act have been called into question by U.S. Supreme Court cases. We synthesize 40+ years of research on longitudinal, lateral, and vertical fluxes of energy, material, and biota between aquatic ecosystems included within the Act's frame of reference. Many questions about the roles of streams and wetlands in sustaining downstream water integrity can be answered from currently available literature, and emerging research is rapidly closing data gaps with exciting new insights into aquatic connectivity and function at local, watershed, and regional scales. Synthesis of foundational and emerging research is needed to support science-based efforts to provide safe, reliable sources of fresh water for present and future generations.Show less"
36,Impact of changes in river network structure on hydrological connectivity of watersheds,"Xingyuan, Z","River network connectivity is a key factor affecting watershed ecosystems and an important criterion for evaluating the health of river. The river network structure of the basin has changed dramatically in recent years due to human activity, but the response of connectivity to changes in physical structure is still poorly understood. In this paper, a dynamic index (connectivity index) based on daily-scale flow and probability density function is proposed to characterize the connectivity capacity of river networks. The Haihe River basin in China is selected as the study area, and a graphic model is constructed to assess the evolutionary structure of the river network. The 54 sections were classified into Low human impact (LHI) and High human impact (HHI), and the trends and causes of connectivity changes of the sections with the evolution of the network were analyzed. The results reveal that the river network degree and clustering coefficient keep increasing, the path length decreases and becomes more dense downstream, and the river network gradually evolves into a ""small-world"" network. The ""smallworld"" characteristics improve the potential efficiency and specific functionality of the river network, but make the physical structure mismatch with the hydraulic gradient, and the network flow disperses severely, leading to a significant decrease in connectivity (HHI connectivity index is lower than LHI 52.1%). Moreover, the structural changes enhance the spatial and temporal differences in hydrological connectivity, which further restricts the function of the river system. ""Small-world"" and connectivity indicators (duration, start time, and intermittency) show strong correlations. Therefore, physical structure is an important factor influencing connectivity capacity of river networks. The planning and management of the watershed should consider the changes in hydrological connectivity caused by the structural modifications of the river network.Show less"
37,High-resolution spatiotemporal analysis of hydrologic connectivity in the historical floodplain of straightened lowland agricultural streams,"Marchand, JP","In agricultural watersheds, human interventions such as channel straightening have disrupted the hydrologic connectivity between headwater streams and their riparian environment and have thus undermined the ecological services provided by these small streams. Knowledge of the hydrologic connectivity between these streams and their immediate environment (shallow riparian groundwater in the historical floodplain and on adjacent hillslopes) in human-impacted settings is critical for understanding and restoring these hydrological systems but remains largely incomplete. The objective of this research is to investigate the hydrogeomorphological conditions controlling hydrologic connectivity in the historical floodplain of straightened lowland streams. Detailed measurements on the spatiotemporal variability of groundwater-surface water interactions between straightened reaches, historical floodplain including abandoned meanders, and the adjacent hillslopes were obtained using a dense network of piezometers at two sites in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (Quebec, Canada). Results show that the complex mechanisms controlling hydrologic connectivity in naturally meandering lowland rivers also operate in highly disturbed straightened reaches, despite backfilling and agricultural practices. The pre-straightening hydrogeomorphological configuration of the floodplain partly explains the complex patterns of piezometric fluctuations observed at the sites. The apex of the abandoned meanders stands out as a focal area of hydrologic connectivity as water levels indicate pressure transfer that may reflect flows from the stream, the hillslopes, and the surrounding historical floodplain. These unique field observations suggest that abandoned meanders should be promoted as key elements of restoration strategies in lowland agricultural straightened headwater streams.Show less"
38,Dynamics of Surface-Water Connectivity in a Low-Gradient Meandering River Floodplain,"Czuba, JA","High-resolution topography reveals that floodplains along meandering rivers in Indiana commonly contain intermittently flowing channel networks. We investigated how the presence of floodplain channels affects lateral surface-water connectivity between a river and floodplain (specifically exchange flux and timescales of transport) as a function of flow stage in a low-gradient river-floodplain system. We constructed a two-dimensional, surface-water hydrodynamic model using Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) 2D along 32km of floodplain (56km along the river) of the East Fork White River near Seymour, Indiana, USA, using lidar elevation data and surveyed river bathymetry. The model was calibrated using land-cover specific roughness to elevation-discharge data from a U.S. Geological Survey gage and validated against high-water marks, an aerial photo showing the spatial extent of floodplain inundation, and measured flow velocities. Using the model results, we analyzed the flow in the river, spatial patterns of inundation, flow pathways, river-floodplain exchange, and water residence time on the floodplain. Our results highlight that bankfull flow is an oversimplified concept for explaining river-floodplain connectivity because some stream banks are overtopped and major low-lying floodplain channels are inundated roughly 19days per year. As flow increased, inundation of floodplain channels at higher elevations dissected the floodplain, until the floodplain channels became fully inundated. Additionally, we found that river-floodplain exchange was driven by bank height or channel orientation depending on flow conditions. We propose a conceptual model of river-floodplain connectivity dynamics and developed metrics to analyze quantitatively complex river-floodplain systems.Show less"
39,Hyporheic rehabilitation in rivers: restoring vertical connectivity,"Boulton, AJ","1. The hyporheic zone below the channel and banks of many rivers where surface water and ground water exchanges plays a crucial functional role in the biogeochemical transformation of water, mediated by active microbial biofilms. This zone also harbours assemblages of invertebrates that graze biofilms, contribute to secondary production, and can alter the porosity of the hyporheic zone through their movement or burrowing activities.2. Many human activities cause interstitial sedimentation or disrupt surface-groundwater hydrological linkages, impacting upon ecological processes in the hyporheic zone. However, strategies for river rehabilitation seldom explicitly consider the hyporheic zone or seek to restore lost vertical linkages with groundwater. Instead, restoration goals target surface, riparian or floodplain features even though current river ecosystem theory emphasises the three dimensions of hydrological connectivity. To guide effective, holistic river restoration, scientists and managers therefore need information on the mechanisms by which energy and material are transferred in the hyporheic zone and which ecosystem services are thus provided.3. Other gaps in our understanding of hyporheic zone rehabilitation include recruitment processes of the hyporheos and the relative importance of groups of hyporheic invertebrates in rivers differing in substratum size, disturbance frequency and groundwater linkages. Carefully designed experiments that assess responses to hyporheic rehabilitation strategies will provide valuable data at varying scales (e.g. distribution of hyporheic habitat types at the reach scale) for management as well as providing insights into the mechanisms controlling hyporheic invertebrate assemblages and ecological processes. Fully successful river rehabilitation must include restoration of vertical linkages between the river and its shallow groundwater aquifers.Show less"
40,Temporal Patterns of Methane Emissions From Two Streams With Different Riparian Connectivity,"Leng, PF","Streams are regionally important sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, but the temporal variability in and control on CH4 concentrations and emissions are not well understood. Especially, lack of long-term data hampers our ability to predict CH4 emissions from streams. Here, we present a 7-year data set of biweekly CH4 concentration and underlying potential drivers from two adjacent small German streams with contrasting riparian area characteristics. Over the 7-year study period, mean CH4 concentration and emissions were 0.20 and 0.07 mu mol L-1 and 2.01 and 0.84 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for the two streams, respectively. Our findings suggest that the combination of seasonality and topography ultimately shaped the considerable temporal variations of CH4. CH4 oxidation and production in the streams were probably of minor importance. Instead, fluctuations in CH4 concentrations likely reflected a temporal pattern of CH4 input from soils of the riparian zone with larger CH4 variations in the stream with more riparian lands. Structural equation modeling revealed dissolved organic carbon and nitrate as important predictors of CH4 concentration. However, we did not identify predictors of the considerable short-term variability, nor the explicit pathways of CH4 delivery to streams. The discrepancy of the CH4 flux between streams was likely triggered by different connectivities to riparian soils with higher CH4 emissions in the hydrologically more connected stream. Interannual comparison showed that changing hydrologic conditions, rather than warming, may impact future CH4 emissions from temperate streams. We predict that higher CH4 emissions occur in wetter years in streams with close connectivity to riparian soils.Show less"
41,A model to evaluate spatiotemporal variations of hydrological connectivity on a basin-scale complex river network with intensive human activity,"Shao, XJ","In recent decades, rivers have been among the most gravely disturbed ecosystems due to intense anthropogenic impacts. Accurate spatial evaluation of river network connectivity is necessary for providing an improved empirical basis for management, conservation, and restoration initiatives. In this study, we focused on the stream continuity-oriented hydrological connectivity of the river network ecosystem. An evaluation model was established using spatiotemporal hydrological data, temporal data on dam development, and a new stream continuity-oriented connectivity index (SCI). The Pearl River basin was selected as the study area to demonstrate the model application using data since 1960. The model showed that the SCI values had significantly and steadily decreasing characteristics in the entire basin from 1960 to 2018, with a total decrease during this period of 26% throughout the river network. The connectivity of the river network declined as the number of dams increased, and dams built on main trunks had a larger impact on the connectivity than those on tributaries. These model results can help government regulators identify the worst connected areas of the river network and take effective measures to reduce the impact of human interferences. Thus, the model can provide practical guidance and support to the conservation, management, and restoration of the river ecosystem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
42,Introducing 'riverconn': an R package to assess river connectivity indices,"Baldan, D","Fragmentation affects river ecosystems worldwide by dampening the movement and dispersal of aquatic organisms and material (such as sediment, water, nutrients) across the river network. In this paper, we develop river connectivity indices to explain biodiversity patterns, prioritize reaches that need habitat restoration and barriers that need improvement. We provide a general framework for calculating connectivity indices by dis-entangling the contribution of the river network's physical setup (structural connectivity) from the process-driven and biota-related contribution (functional connectivity). To facilitate the calculations, the R package 'riverconn' is introduced. A prioritization of habitats and barriers is carried out for the Ebro river (North-West Iberian Peninsula) using indices setups accounting for different classes of organisms and dispersal traits. Resulting prioritizations are very diverse. 'Riverconn' can support scientists and managers working on riverscape planning and population and community ecology by providing a means to compute and compare a wide array of fragmentation indices.Show less"
43,A hydrologic connectivity index for jurisdictional analysis of headwater streams in a montane watershed,"Caruso, BS","A hydrologic connectivity index (HCI) was developed to aid the US Clean Water Act Section 404 jurisdictional evaluation of headwater streams in montane watersheds, using the Cement Creek Watershed in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado as a case study. Jurisdictional determinations are required for many intermittent and ephemeral streams, where significant nexus with downstream traditional navigable waters (TNWs) must be evaluated. Three biophysical metrics (a streamflow metric, distance from the stream to the TNW, and slope between the stream and the TNW) for 239 streams in the watershed were used to develop three indices. These were then combined to develop the HCI, which is a compound, additive index. There was a large range of HCI values for ephemeral streams, which all require a significant nexus evaluation to determine jurisdiction. Statistical analysis of HCI values across stream duration and order classes showed that mean values differed significantly among classes. The flow index component constituted the greatest proportion of the HCI for perennial streams, was sensitive to the flow metrics used, and was greatest for high flows. Although ephemeral streams are only connected to the TNW less than 3 months of the year, the cumulative average annual flow contribution of ephemeral first-order streams can be 5 % of the total to the TNW, and their flow contribution is larger during high flows. Some ephemeral streams with high HCI values are farthest from the TNW but contribute the greatest flow out of all ephemeral reaches, and may have significant nexus with the river. The study shows that the HCI can be useful for initial evaluation of connectivity, significant nexus, and jurisdiction of headwaters at the watershed scale.Show less"
44,Conceptual assessment of (dis)connectivity and its application to the Ganga River dispersal system,"Jain, V","Connectivity in river dispersal systems is an important evolving concept and helps in understanding their dynamics. In this study, the types of connectivity have been defined on the basis of two components, namely ""physical contact"" and ""transfer of material."" Based on this, four types of connectivity are recognized. These are (a) active connected system, (b) inactive connected system, (c) partially active connected system, and (d) disconnected system. Connectivity indices have been proposed based on the process understanding of different types of connectivity. This conceptual understanding of connectivity has been applied to the Ganga dispersal system, a large river system. Results of the connectivity analysis on the Ganga dispersal system reveal that different sets of data such as sediment budgets, geochemical isotopic data and radiogenic (U-238-U-234-Th-230) data are noncoherent. Therefore, developing rigorous and well constrained quantitative multidisciplinary data sets is needed to have a better understanding of connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales in large river dispersal systems; this would ultimately help model the dynamics of such systems.

45,Process connectivity in a naturally prograding river delta,"Sendrowski, A","River deltas are lowland systems that can display high hydrological connectivity. This connectivity can be structural (morphological connections), functional (control of fluxes), and process connectivity (information flow from system drivers to sinks). In this work, we quantify hydrological process connectivity in Wax Lake Delta, coastal Louisiana, by analyzing couplings among external drivers (discharge, tides, and wind) and water levels recorded at five islands and one channel over summer 2014. We quantify process connections with information theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with the communication of information. We represent process connections as a network; variables serve as network nodes and couplings as network links describing the strength, direction, and time scale of information flow. Comparing process connections at long (105 days) and short (10 days) time scales, we show that tides exhibit daily synchronization with water level, with decreasing strength from downstream to upstream, and that tides transfer information as tides transition from spring to neap. Discharge synchronizes with water level and the time scale of its information transfer compares well to physical travel times through the system, computed with a hydrodynamic model. Information transfer and physical transport show similar spatial patterns, although information transfer time scales are larger than physical travel times. Wind events associated with water level setup lead to increased process connectivity with highly variable information transfer time scales. We discuss the information theory results in the context of the hydrologic behavior of the delta, the role of vegetation as a connector/disconnector on islands, and the applicability of process networks as tools for delta modeling results.Plain Language Summary Connectivity is an increasingly important concept in studying the complexity and evolution of landscapes. One aspect of connectivity often overlooked is process connectivity; the interaction between external drivers and system variables such as water level and sediment concentration. A better understanding of deltaic process connectivity would benefit numerical modelers in improving delta simulations. In this work, we apply information theory to directly quantify for the first time the connectivity between discharge, wind, and tides, and water level at five deltaic islands and one channel in Wax Lake Delta (WLD), a prograding delta in coastal Louisiana that is often cast as an analog of a river diversion system. The importance of deltaic islands as areas of increased biogeochemical processing make this analysis particularly relevant to better understand the hydrologic controls on islands. Our results highlight the multi-scale interactions between external drivers and deltaic water level. The role of wind events, tidal regime, and vegetation controls in process connectivity indicate the dynamic nature of deltaic systems. Couplings are characterized in terms of strength, direction, significance, and scale. Process connectivity is visualized as a process network; variables are network nodes and couplings are network links that depict significant information flow.Show less"
46,"Controls on morphological variability and role of stream power distribution pattern, Yamuna River, western India","Bawa, N","Understanding the controls on the morphological variability of river systems constitutes one of the fundamental questions in geomorphic investigation. Channel morphology is an important indicator of river processes and is of significance for mapping the hydrology-ecologic connectivity in a river system and for predicting the future trajectory of river health in response to external forcings. This paper documents the spatial morphological variability and its natural and anthropogenic controls for the Yamuna River, a major tributary of the Ganga River, India. The Yamuna River runs through a major urban centre i.e. Delhi National Capital Region. The Yamuna River was divided into eight geomorphically distinct reaches on the basis of the assemblages of geomorphic units and the association of landscape, valley and floodplain settings. The morphological variability was analysed through stream power distribution and sediment load data at various stations. Stream power distribution of the Yamuna River basin is characterised by a non-linear pattern that was used to distinguish (a) high energy 'natural' upstream reaches, (b) 'anthropogenically altered', low energy middle stream reaches, and (c) 'rejuvenated' downstream reaches again with higher stream power. The relationship between stream power and channel morphology in these reaches was integrated with sediment load data to define the maximum flow efficiency (MFE) as the threshold for geomorphic transition. This analysis supports the continuity of river processes and the significance of a holistic, basin-scale approach rather than isolated local scale analysis in river studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

47,Modelling hydrological connectivity of tropical floodplain wetlands via a combined natural and artificial stream network,"Karim, F","The ecological condition and biodiversity values of floodplain wetlands are highly dependent on the hydrological connectivity of wetlands to adjacent rivers. This paper describes a method for quantifying connectivity between floodplain wetlands and the main rivers in a wet tropical catchment of northern Australia. We used a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate time-varying water depths across the stream network (i.e. rivers, streams and man-made drains). The timing and duration of connectivity of seven wetlands (four natural and three artificial) with the two main rivers in the catchment were then calculated for different hydrological conditions. Location and areal extent of the wetlands and the stream network were identified using high-resolution laser altimetry, and these data formed key inputs to the hydrodynamic model. The model was calibrated using measured water depths and discharges across the floodplain. An algorithm was developed to identify contiguous water bodies at daily time steps, and this gave the temporal history of connection and disconnection between wetlands and the rivers. Simulation results show that connectivity of individual wetlands to both rivers varies from 26 to 365days during an average hydrological condition. Location, especially proximity to a main river, and wetland type (natural stream or artificial drain) were identified as key factors influencing these levels of connectivity. Some natural wetlands maintain connection with the river for most or all of the year, whereas the connectivity of some artificial wetlands varies from 26 to 36days according to their patterns of network connection to adjacent rivers - a result that has important implications for the accessibility of these types of wetland to aquatic biota. Using readily available river gauge data, we also show how connectivity modelling can be used to identify periods when connectivity has fallen below critical thresholds for fish movement. These connectivity patterns within the floodplain network are central to the setting of river flows that will meet environmental requirements for biota that use floodplain wetlands during their life history.

48,Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and macrohabitat connectivity in Mediterranean-climate streams of northern California,"Bonada, N","Drought leads to a loss of longitudinal and lateral hydrologic connectivity, which causes direct or indirect changes in stream ecosystem properties. Changes in macrohabitat availability from a riffle-pool sequence to isolated pools are among the most conspicuous consequences of connectivity loss. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared among 3 distinct stream macrohabitats (riffles [R], pools connected to riffles [Pc], disconnected pools [Pd]) of 19 Mediterranean-climate sites in northern California to examine the influence of loss of habitat resulting from drought disturbance. At the time of sampling, 10 sites were perennial and included R and Pc macrohabitats, whereas 9 sites were intermittent and included only Pd macrohabitats. Taxa richness was more variable in Pd, and taxa richness was significantly lower in Pd than in Pc but not R. These results suggested a decline in richness between Pc and Pd that might be associated with loss of connectivity. Lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness relative to Odonata, Coleoptera, and Heteroptera (OCH) richness was observed for Pd than R and Pc macrohabitats. Family composition was more similar between R and Pc than between R or Pc and Pd macrohabitats. This similarity may be associated with greater connectivity between R and Pc macrohabitats. Correspondence analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate composition changed along a gradient from R to Pc and Pd that was related to a perennial-intermittent gradient across sites. High variability among macroinvertebrate assemblages in Pd could have been related to variability in the duration of intermittency. In cluster analysis, macroinvertebrate assemblages were grouped by macrohabitat first and then by site, suggesting that the macrohabitat filter had a greater influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than did local site characteristics. Few taxa were found exclusively in Pc, and this macrohabitat shared numerous taxa with R and Pd, indicating that Pc may act as a bridge between R and Pd during drought. Drought is regarded as a ramp disturbance, but our results suggest that the response of macroinvertebrate assemblages to the loss of hydrological connectivity among macrohabitats is gradual, at least in Mediterranean-climate streams where drying is gradual. However, the changes may be more dramatic in and and semiarid streams or in Mediterranean-climate streams if drying is rapid.Show less"
49,A dynamic connectivity metric for complex river wetlands,"Nguyen, C","Surface water connectivity between rivers and floodplain lakes is essential to maintain biodiversity and ecological functioning in floodplain wetlands. This study proposes a method to analyze the spatial and temporal connectivity using hydraulic modeling and freely available remote sensing data. A novel dynamic connectivity metric introduced here accounts for the entire flow path, which can be a substitute for flow connectivity indicators and statistical connectivity indicators. The metric allows comparing the hydrological connectivity between different phases of a flood event, between different flood events, and potentially between different catchments. The method was applied to the Northern Lakes of the Narran River catchment in New South Wales, Australia. The results indicate that there is no clear transition in the connectivity between different stages of a flood event in the flat Narran River wetland compared with other wetlands connecting to deeper river channels. Thus, the proposed metric brings a more comprehensive observation on hydrological connectivity in floodplain wetlands than previously developed metrics, which is expected to further support ecological and water management studies in river catchments.Show less"
