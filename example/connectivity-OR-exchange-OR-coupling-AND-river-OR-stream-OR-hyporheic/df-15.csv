0,"Maazouzi, C",Jan 2013 ,Nutrient dynamics in river bed sediments: effects of hydrological disturbances using experimental flow manipulations,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"River sediments play a crucial role in the storage and transformation of organic matter (OM). Nutrient dynamics are controlled by the interaction of several key parameters, i.e. river discharge, channel geometry and vertical exchanges of water (upwelling vs. downwelling zones). The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of channel forms and discharge variation on nutrient spiralling in the hyporheic zone (HZ) of streams.Four experimental flow manipulations (EFM) were carried out at two reaches with different channel forms (straight vs. sinuous) in an oligotrophic subtropical river in Australia. Flow manipulation consisted of reducing the river width with a temporary dam, diverting and concentrating the main water flux on two different geomorphological units (riffle vs. gravel bar), in order to simulate flooding conditions. Hyporheic waters were analysed for their physicochemical characteristics and nutrient (nitrates + nitrites = NO (x) and soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP]) and OM contents at two depths (10 and 50 cm) within the bed sediments, both upstream and downstream of the geomorphological units.The physicochemical parameters clearly demonstrated the existence of hyporheic flow paths, characterized by the alternation of downwelling and upwelling areas, with more consistent gradients in gravel bars than in riffles. The HZ acted as source for NO (x) and SRP, but this role varied between geomorphological units and reaches. The effect of EFM differed between sampling points, irrespective of the type of geomorphological unit. In gravel bars, a flush out during high discharge was observed for NO (x) , SRP and particulate organic matter (POM) at the sinuous channel, whereas storage and removal were recorded at the straight channel for SRP and NO (x) , respectively. At the riffle of the sinuous channel, very fine POM accumulated, while removal was noticed for POM. In contrast, at the riffle of the straight channel, SRP accumulated in the HZ and NO (x) was removed out of the HZ.Nutrient dynamics in the HZ and the response to flow increases were not governed by the geomorphological unit type. Other parameters that determine water residence time in the sediments, such as local heterogeneity in sediment characteristics (grain size, porosity and hydraulic conductivity), channel sinuosity, reach slope and the size and form of the gravel bar, may be more significant explanatory variables for understanding OM and nutrient dynamics in the HZ. This study emphasizes the need for caution in making generalisations about the role of river sediment in nutrient storage and the impact of floods on nutrient dynamics.Show less"

We examined how conversion of Amazon lowland tropical forest to cattle pasture influenced the physical and chemical structure, organic matter stocks and N cycling of small streams. We combined a regional ground survey of small streams with an intensive study of nutrient cycling using N-15 additions in three representative streams: a second-order forest stream, a second-order pasture stream and a third-order pasture stream. These three streams were within several km of each other and on similar soils. Replacement of forest with pasture decreased stream habitat complexity by changing streams from run and pool channels with forest leaf detritus (50% cover) to grass-filled (63% cover) channel with runs of slow-moving water. In the survey, pasture streams consistently had lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nitrate (NO3 (-)) compared with similar-sized forest streams. Stable isotope additions revealed that second-order pasture stream had a shorter NH4 (+) uptake length, higher uptake rates into organic matter components and a shorter (NH4)-N-15 (+) residence time than the second-order forest stream or the third-order pasture stream. Nitrification was significant in the forest stream (19% of the added (NH4)-N-15 (+)) but not in the second-order pasture (0%) or third-order (6%) pasture stream. The forest stream retained 7% of added N-15 in organic matter compartments and exported 53% ((NH4)-N-15 (+) = 34%; (NO3)-N-15 (-) = 19%). In contrast, the second-order pasture stream retained 75% of added N-15, predominantly in grasses (69%) and exported only 4% as (NH4)-N-15 (+). The fate of tracer N-15 in the third-order pasture stream more closely resembled that in the forest stream, with 5% of added N retained and 26% exported ((NH4)-N-15 (+) = 9%; (NO3)-N-15 (-) = 6%). These findings indicate that the widespread infilling by grass in small streams in areas deforested for pasture greatly increases the retention of inorganic N in the first- and second-order streams, which make up roughly three-fourths of total stream channel length in Amazon basin watersheds. The importance of this phenomenon and its effect on N transport to larger rivers across the larger areas of the Amazon Basin will depend on better evaluation of both the extent and the scale at which stream infilling by grass occurs, but our analysis suggests the phenomenon is widespread.Show less"

We added bromide as a conservative tracer and acetate as an organic substrate to the hyporheic zone of Rio Calaveras, New Mexico, via an injection well. Tracer was observed in four of eight capture wells. Three of the four wells showed increases in bromide without concurrent increases in acetate concentration, suggesting 100% acetate retention. One well had 38% acetate retention. Pore velocity and acetate retention were negatively correlated, suggesting hydrologic control of acetate retention. Acetate did not significantly sorb to the sandy hyporheic sediments at this site, indicating biological consumption of acetate. Acetate addition stimulated total CO2 production along monitored flowpaths and led to changes in solutes associated with microbial terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs). Dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, and sulfate significantly decreased, and ferrous iron and methane significantly increased compared to background concentrations in most wells. These results support the hypothesis that microbial respiration in the hyporheic zone is limited by labile DOC availability. Furthermore, we have shown that a suite of metabolic processes, from aerobic respiration to methanogenesis, cooccur and that anaerobic processes dominate heterotrophic metabolism in the hyporheic zone of Rio Calaveras.Show less"
4,"Michel, C",Mar 2014 ,Artificial steps mitigate the effect of fine sediment on the survival of brown trout embryos in a heavily modified river,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Understanding the factors that determine successful salmonid embryo incubation in the many structurally modified river systems of the Northern Hemisphere is crucial for maintaining healthy salmonid populations. In this context, the joint impact of fine sediment accumulation together with anthropogenic river modifications on salmonid embryo survival has been rarely investigated. We investigated brown trout embryo survival to hatch (STH) together with ten physicochemical, hydraulic and morphological parameters in artificial brown trout redds in a heavily modified stream (i.e. channelized, artificial log steps) in central Switzerland. We were interested to understand whether (i) STH is more sensitive to the timing and duration of low oxygen rather than a mean oxygen concentration, (ii) STH was negatively affected by increased fine sediment deposition decreasing redd gravel permeability, (iii) higher water levels, causing fine sediment resuspension, benefit STH, (iv) STH was negatively affected by organic content in the redds and especially (v) hydraulic gradients related to redd scale bed-form and/or the artificial step structure benefit embryo STH, and hence could mitigate the negative impact of fine sediment and/or organic content. Up to 50%, brown trout embryos survived with interstitial oxygen exceeding 3mg L-1. Embryos endured up to 6days 1mg L-1 but were more sensitive to oxygen depletion close to hatch. Therefore, timing and duration of low oxygen were important for embryo STH, and hence, oxygen dynamics need to be considered when assessing in redd conditions for salmonid STH. Partial least squares regression identified the horizontal hydraulic gradient, Fredle index, distance to artificial log steps upstream and amount of accumulated fine sediment as influential predictors for embryo STH. The water level above the redd and total organic carbon content in the redd were not influential. Among the identified influential predictors, 70.9% of the variation in STH could be explained by a logistic regression model containing redd distance to the next upstream step (26.4%, P=0.004), Fredle index (27.2%, P=0.003) and horizontal hydraulic gradient (10.1%, P=0.04). In the logistic regression, the amount of accumulated fine sediment (P=0.75), field seasons (P=0.93) and field sites (P=0.66) was non-significant. In summary, brown trout STH was sensitive to redd gravel permeability, which was measured as Fredle index and affected by fine sediment deposition. At the same time, hydraulic gradients related to artificial log steps, which enhanced hyporheic exchange, benefited embryo STH, and hence mitigated fine sediment impact. This result can be probably transferred to other surface water-dominated river systems with good hyporheic water quality. To what extent it can be transferred to river systems with other hydraulic boundary conditions remains to be evaluated. Altogether, our results clearly indicate that the impact of fine sediment on salmonid incubation success needs to be understood in the hydrological and morphological context of the particular river system.Show less"
5,"Xiao, Y",Aug 2022 ,Numerical simulation of overbank hyporheic transport and biogeochemical reactions in a compound channel,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Transverse hyporheic transport and biogeochemical reactions in a compound channel remain poorly understood. As floodplains are submerged, solutes in the surface water enter the hyporheic zone of the compound channel and react with the solutes upwelling below the floodplain. Aerobic respiration (AR) and denitrification (DN) processes in the hyporheic zone of the compound channel still need to be clarified. In this paper, a 3D hydrodynamic model coupled to a 2D groundwater flow and biogeochemical model was applied to investigate such processes. The model results were verified using laboratory experimental measurements. The effects of bank slope angle, ambient groundwater flow, and ambient groundwater solute concentration on aerobic and anaerobic biogeochemical processes were studied. The denitrification zone was found below the interface between the main channel and the floodplain. The lower bank slope angle favours nitrogen removal. Small losing groundwater discharges promote aerobic respiration and denitrification reactions. As the ambient groundwater oxygen concentration rises, O-2 consumption increases while N removal decreases. As the NO3 concentration in ambient groundwater increases, NO3 consumption increases and proportionally NO3 consumption decreases. These findings not only provide a better understanding of biogeochemical reactions in a compound channel but can also be applied to river restoration to efficiently remove nitrate by modifying bank slope angles.Show less"
6,"Weitbrecht, V",Feb 2008 ,Experiments on mass exchange between groin fields and main stream in rivers,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Laboratory experiments are presented that model the exchange processes between a river and dead-water zones created by groin fields. The measurement methods include particle image velocimetry (PIV) at the water surface to capture the dynamics of the flow field as well as planar concentration analysis (PCA) to determine the depth integrated mass fluxes of dissolved tracer. Idealized groins with variable length-to-width ratios and inclination angles relative to the flow direction are investigated. Two-dimensional large coherent structures (2DLCS) are found in the mixing layer between the groin field and the river, and these flow structures control the majority of mixing with the main stream. The PIV data allow quantification of the turbulence intensity distribution in these structures throughout the groin field and mixing region. The PCA data provide measurements of the exchange rate between the groin field and the main stream. Both methods give comparable measures of the entrainment coefficient for the exchange flow. The entrainment coefficient is found to depend on the groin field hydraulic radius (a measure of the average size of 2DLCS in the mixing layer) and the water depth (a parameter controlling the stability of the shallow water flow). These data provide a link between the exchange parameter in groin field dead zones and the river properties that can be used to efficiently develop river alarm models to predict contaminant transport without requiring a large amount of field dye studies for calibration.Show less"
7,"Jin, GQ",Apr 2015 ,Prolonged river water pollution due to variable-density flow and solute transport in the riverbed,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A laboratory experiment and numerical modeling were used to examine effects of density gradients on hyporheic flow and solute transport under the condition of a solute pulse input to a river with regular bed forms. Relatively low-density gradients due to an initial salt pulse concentration of 1.55 kg m(-3) applied in the experiment were found to modulate significantly the pore-water flow and solute transport in the riverbed. Such density gradients increased downward flow and solute transport in the riverbed by factors up to 1.6. This resulted in a 12.2% increase in the total salt transfer from the water column to the riverbed over the salt pulse period. As the solute pulse passed, the effect of the density gradients reversed, slowing down the release of the solute back to the river water by a factor of 3.7. Numerical modeling indicated that these density effects intensified as salt concentrations in the water column increased. Simulations further showed that the density gradients might even lead to unstable flow and result in solute fingers in the bed of large bed forms. The slow release of solute from the bed back to the river led to a long tail of solute concentration in the river water. These findings have implications for assessment of impact of pollution events on river systems, in particular, long-term effects on both the river water and riverbed due to the hyporheic exchange.Show less"
8,"Bartsch, S",Feb 13 2014 ,River-aquifer exchange fluxes under monsoonal climate conditions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"An important prerequisite to better understand the transport of nutrients and contaminants across the river-aquifer interface and possible implications for biogeochemical transformations is to accurately characterize and asses the exchange fluxes. In this study we investigate how monsoonal precipitation events and the resulting variability in river discharge affect the dynamics of river-aquifer exchange and the corresponding flux rates. We evaluate potential impacts of the investigated exchange fluxes on local water quality. Hydraulic gradients along a piezometer transect were monitored at a river reach in a small catchment in South Korea, where the hydrologic dynamics are driven by the East-Asian Monsoon. We used heat as a tracer to constrain river-aquifer exchange fluxes in a two-dimensional flow and heat transport model implemented in the numerical code HydroGeoSphere, which was calibrated to the measured temperature and total head data. To elucidate potential effects of river-aquifer exchange dynamics on biogeochemical transformations at the river-aquifer interface, river water and groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate (NO3) and dissolved oxygen saturation (DOsat). Our results illustrate highly variable hydrologic conditions during the monsoon season characterized by temporal and spatial variability in river-aquifer exchange fluxes with frequent flow reversals (changes between gaining and losing conditions). Intense monsoonal precipitation events and the associated rapid changes in river stage are the dominant driver for the observed riverbed flow reversals. The chemical data suggest that the flow reversals, when river water high in DOC is pushed into the nitrate-rich groundwater below the stream and subsequently returns to the stream may facilitate and enhance the natural attenuation of nitrate in the shallow groundwater.

9,"Cai, Y",Aug 2022 ,"Occurrence Characteristics of Inorganic Nitrogen in Groundwater in Silty-Clay Riparian Hyporheic Zones under Tidal Action: A Case Study of the Jingzi River in Shanghai, China",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,"For comprehending the effect of tidal action on nitrogen cycle in silty-clay riparian hyporheic zones, the synchronous monitoring of water level and water quality was carried out along a test transect during a spring tidal period from 21 to 23 October 2021. Moreover, the permeability and chemical composition of soil samples from drilled holes were measured. Subsequently, the spatiotemporal variation of inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the groundwater in the riparian hyporheic zone was investigated during the study period, and the potential reason was discussed. It is shown that the delayed response time of groundwater level in the silty-clay riparian zone to the tide-driven fluctuation of the river stage increased with distance from the shore and reached 3.0 h at the position 3.83 m away from the shore. The continuous infiltration of the river water under tide action contributed to the aerobic and neutral riparian hyporheic zone conductive to nitrification. Within 4 m away from the bank, the dominant inorganic nitrogen form changed from NO3--N to NH4+-N, upon increasing the distance from the bank. Additionally, the removal of nitrogen could 4 occur in the riparian hyporheic zone with aerobic and neutral environment under the conjoint control of nitrification, microbial assimilation, and aerobic denitrification.Show less"
10,"Mueller, M",Mar 2013 ,The effects of stream substratum texture on interstitial conditions and bacterial biofilms: Methodological strategies,LIMNOLOGICA,"Hyporheic substrates play a key role in aquatic ecosystems, and increasing loads of fine sediment are considered one of the major threats to stream ecosystems. Knowledge concerning the interaction of stream substratum properties with habitat quality and microbial community structure is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the functionality of the hyporheic zone. To date, there is a lack of optimal field sampling methods for hyporheic microbial communities in streams. We systematically tested the effects of defined substratum textures on the physicochemical properties of interstitial water and on bacterial communities utilising T-RFLP fingerprinting. We also tested the representativeness of different methodological approaches of investigating bacterial diversity comparing sampling of substratum, interstitial water, and exposed coupons made of granite, carbonate and glass. The temporal development of physicochemical habitat characteristics in the interstitial zone, especially of fish-toxic nitrogen compounds and oxygen supply, significantly depended on substratum texture and was strongly correlated with bacterial community composition. Multivariate analyses of bacterial community data indicated strong differences in community composition between direct (substratum samples) and indirect (interstitial water samples, coupons) sampling strategies. Substratum samples yielded highest richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the most pronounced temporal dynamics of bacterial community composition, Consequently, this technique appears most representative for assessing bacterial community structure and diversity in hyporheic habitats. The observed couplings between substratum texture, physicochemical habitat conditions and bacterial community structure expand current knowledge of previously described negative effects of fine sediments on taxa from higher levels of biological organization.

11,"Drummond, JD",Apr 28 2022 ,Modeling Contaminant Microbes in Rivers During Both Baseflow and Stormflow,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Rivers transport contaminant microorganisms (including fecal indicator bacteria and human pathogens) long distances downstream of diffuse and point sources, posing a human health risk. We present a mobile-immobile model that incorporates transport as well as immobilization and remobilization of contaminant microbes and other fine particles during baseflow and stormflow. During baseflow conditions, hyporheic exchange flow causes particles to accumulate in streambed sediments. Remobilization of stored particles from streambed sediments occurs slowly during baseflow via hyporheic exchange flow, while remobilization is vastly increased during stormflow. Model predictions are compared to observations over a range of artificial and natural flood events in the dairy contaminated Topehaehae Stream, New Zealand. The model outputs closely matched timing and magnitude of E. coli and turbidity observations through multiple high-flow events. By accounting for both state-of-flow and hyporheic exchange processes, the model provides a valuable framework for predicting particle and contaminant microbe behavior in streams.Show less"
12,"Huybrechts, N",Mar 2013 ,Coupled estimation of the energy slope and associated sand-silt transport during high stream power events in alluvial rivers,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,"A coupled routing for the transport capacity and the energy slope is introduced through the definition of the control factor m whose value is linked to the bed form configuration. The coupling aims to further incorporate the interactions occurring in alluvial rivers and thus enhance the prediction of the fine sediment fluxes, especially during high stream power events. Based on a predictive rule for the control factor m that only involves water depth, velocity and bedform constitutive texture, the novel method is confronted to observations collected in one of the most strongly dynamic alluvial river namely the Lower Yellow River. Comparisons between time series of measured and computed concentrations illustrate that during high velocity events the main dynamics of the sediment transport is correctly reproduced. The main advantage of the present approach is to supply consistent time evolutions of sediment concentrations without making use of any detailed shear information.Show less"
13,"Fuller, CC",Apr 1 2000 ,"Reactive uptake of trace metals in the hyporheic zone of a mining-contaminated stream, Pinal Creek, Arizona",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Significant uptake of dissolved metals occurred by interaction of groundwater and surface water with hyporheic-zone sediments during transport in Final Creek, AZ. The extent of trace metal uptake was calculated by mass balance measurements made directly within the hyporheic zone. A conservative salute tracer injected into the stream was used to quantify hydrologic exchange with the stream and groundwater. Fractional reactive uptake of dissolved metals entering the hyporheic zone was determined at 29 sites and averaged 52 +/- 25, 27 +/- 19, and 36 +/-: 24% for Co, Ni, and Zn, compared with Mn uptake of 22 +/- 19%. First-order rate constants (lambda(h)) Of metal uptake in the hyporheic zone were determined at seven sites using the exchange rate of water derived from tracer arrival in the streambed. Reaction-time constants (1/lambda(h)) averaged 0.41, 0.84, and 0.38 h for Co, Ni, and Zn, respectively, and 1.3 h for Mn. In laboratory experiments with streambed sediments, metal uptake increased with preexisting Mn oxide concentration, supporting our interpretation that Mn oxides in the hyporheic zone enhance trace metal uptake. Reach-scale mass-balance calculations that include groundwater metal inputs indicated that decreases in metal loads ranged from 12 to 68% over the 7-km perennial reach depending on the metal. The decreases in metal loads are attributed to uptake of trace metals by Mn oxides in the hyporheic zone that is enhanced because of ongoing Mn oxide formation. Analysis of dissolved-metal streambed profiles and conservative solute tracers provide a valuable tool for quantifying metal uptake or release in the hyporheic zone of contaminated streams.Show less"
14,"Meyer, JL",Feb 2007 ,The contribution of headwater streams to biodiversity in river networks,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"The diversity of life in headwater streams (intermittent, first and second order) contributes to the biodiversity of a river system and its riparian network. Small streams differ widely in physical, chemical, and biotic attributes, thus providing habitats for a range of unique species. Headwater species include permanent residents as well as migrants that travel to headwaters at particular seasons or life stages. Movement by migrants links headwaters with downstream and terrestrial ecosystems, as do exports such as emerging and drifting insects. We review the diversity of taxa dependent on headwaters. Exemplifying this diversity are three unmapped headwaters that support over 290 taxa. Even intermittent streams may support rich and distinctive biological communities, in part because of the predictability of dry periods. The influence of headwaters on downstream systems emerges from their attributes that meet unique habitat requirements of residents and migrants by: offering a refuge from temperature and flow extremes, competitors, predators, and introduced species; serving as a source of colonists; providing spawning sites and rearing areas; being a rich source of food; and creating migration corridors throughout the landscape. Degradation and loss of headwaters and their connectivity to ecosystems downstream threaten the biological integrity of entire river networks.Show less"
15,"Newcomer, ME",Mar 2018 ,Influence of Hydrological Perturbations and Riverbed Sediment Characteristics on Hyporheic Zone Respiration of CO2 and N-2,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Rivers in climatic zones characterized by dry and wet seasons often experience periodic transitions between losing and gaining conditions across the river-aquifer continuum. Infiltration shifts can stimulate hyporheic microbial biomass growth and cycling of riverine carbon and nitrogen leading to major exports of biogenic CO2 and N-2 to rivers. In this study, we develop and test a numerical model that simulates biological-physical feedback in the hyporheic zone. We used the model to explore different initial conditions in terms of dissolved organic carbon availability, sediment characteristics, and stochastic variability in aerobic and anaerobic conditions from water table fluctuations. Our results show that while highly losing rivers have greater hyporheic CO2 and N-2 production, gaining rivers allowed the greatest fraction of CO2 and N-2 production to return to the river. Hyporheic aerobic respiration and denitrification contributed 0.1-2g/m(2)/d of CO2 and 0.01-0.2g/m(2)/d of N-2; however, the suite of potential microbial behaviors varied greatly among sediment characteristics. We found that losing rivers that consistently lacked an exit pathway can store up to 100% of the entering C/N as subsurface biomass and dissolved gas. Our results demonstrate the importance of subsurface feedbacks whereby microbes and hydrology jointly control fate of C and N and are strongly linked to wet-season control of initial sediment conditions and hydrologic control of seepage direction. These results provide a new understanding of hydrobiological and sediment-based controls on hyporheic zone respiration, including a new explanation for the occurrence of anoxic microzones and large denitrification rates in gravelly riverbeds.Plain Language Summary River systems are important components of our landscape that help to degrade contaminants, support food webs, and transform organic matter. In this study, we developed and tested a model that could help reveal the role of the riverbed for these ecosystem services. We used the model to explore how different riverbed conditions eventually control the fate of carbon and nitrogen. Our results show that carbon and nitrogen transformations and the potential suite of microbial behaviors are dependent on the riverbed sediment structure and the water table conditions in the local groundwater system. The implications of this are that the riverbed sediments and the cumulative effect of water table conditions can control hyporheic processing. Under future river discharge conditions, assuming reduced river flows and siltation of riverbeds, reductions in total hyporheic processing may be observed.Show less"
16,"Briggs, MA",May 30 2014 ,Residence time control on hot moments of net nitrate production and uptake in the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The retention capacity for biologically available nitrogen within streams can be influenced by dynamic hyporheic zone exchange, a process that may act as either a net source or net sink of dissolved nitrogen. Over 5 weeks, nine vertical profiles of streambed chemistry (NO3- and NH4+) were collected above two beaver dams along with continuous high-resolution vertical hyporheic flux data. The results indicate a non-linear relation of net NO3- production followed by net uptake in the hyporheic zone as a function of residence time. This Lagrangian-based relation is consistent through time and across varied morphology (bars, pools, glides) above the dams, even though biogeochemical and environmental factors varied. The empirical continuum between net NO3- production and uptake and residence time is useful for identifying two crucial residence time thresholds: the transition to anaerobic respiration, which corresponds to the time of peak net nitrate production, and the net sink threshold, which is defined by a net uptake in NO3- relative to streamwater. Short-term hyporheic residence time variability at specific locations creates hot moments of net production and uptake, enhancing NO3- production as residence times approach the anaerobic threshold, and changing zones of net NO3- production to uptake as residence times increase past the net sink threshold. The anaerobic and net sink thresholds for beaver-influenced streambed morphology occur at much shorter residence times (1.3 h and 2.3 h, respectively) compared to other documented hyporheic systems, and the net sink threshold compares favorably to the lower boundary of the anaerobic threshold determined for this system with the new oxygen Damkohler number. The consistency of the residence time threshold values of NO3- cycling in this study, despite environmental variability and disparate morphology, indicates that NO3- hot moment dynamics are primarily driven by changes in physical hydrology and associated residence times.

17,"Zhou, YQ",Mar-apr 2014 ,The Influence of Streambed Heterogeneity on Hyporheic Flow in Gravelly Rivers,GROUNDWATER,"Deposits of open-framework gravel occurring in gravelly streambeds can exert a significant influence on hyporheic flow. The influence was quantified using a numerical model of the hyporheic zone. The model included open-framework gravel stratasets represented with commonly observed characteristics including a volume fraction of about one-third of the streambed sediment, a hydraulic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than other strata present, and a spatial connectivity forming preferential-flow pathways. The influence of open-framework gravel stratasets on hyporheic flow was much greater than the influence of the channel morphology including meanders, point bars, dunes, and ripples. Seventy percent of the total hyporheic exchange occurred across 30% of the channel boundary at locations of open-framework gravel stratasets. The maximum local interfacial flux rates occurred at these locations, and were orders of magnitude greater than those at other locations. The local flux rates varied by six orders of magnitude over the channel boundary. The composite flow rate through the model with open-framework gravel stratsets was an order of magnitude greater than that through an equivalent but homogeneous model.Show less"

This paper analyzes the connectivity elements and processes controlling riparian vegetation for a reach of the upper Parana River (Brazil) and estimates the future changes in channel-vegetation relationship as a consequence of the managing of a large dam. The studied reach is situated 30 km downstream from the Porto Primavera Dam (construction finished in 1999). Through aerial photography (1:25,000, 1996), RGB-CBERS satellite imagery and a previous field botany survey it was possible to elaborate a map with the five major morpho-vegetation units: 1) Tree-dominated natural levee, 2) Shrubby upper floodplain, 3) Shrub-herbaceous mid floodplain, 4) Grass-herbaceous lower floodplain and 5) Shrub-herbaceous flood runoff channel units. By use of a detailed topographic survey and statistical tools each morpho-vegetation type was analyzed according to its connectivity parameters (frequency, recurrence, permanence, seasonality, potamophase, limnophase and FCQ index) in the pre- and post-dam closure periods of the historical series. Data showed that most of the morpho-vegetation units were predicted to present changes in connectivity parameters values after dam closing and the new regime could affect, in different intensity, the river ecology and particularly the riparian vegetation. The methods used in this study can be useful for dam impact studies in other South American tropical rivers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
19,"Jin, GQ",Nov 16 2011 ,Hyporheic flow under periodic bed forms influenced by low-density gradients,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Small density variations across streambeds due to low solute concentrations in stream water exist commonly in streams and rivers. Using laboratory experiments and numerical modeling, we demonstrated that even small density variations can influence hyporheic flow in streambeds with periodic bed forms. The circulating pore water flow patterns in the bed were modified constantly as the solute front moved downward. Density-induced head gradients eventually overwhelmed the regional hydraulic gradient and drove the circulating flow below a hydraulic divide that would have existed without the density influence. The density-modified hyporheic flow provided a relatively fast solute transport mechanism and enhanced the overall mass exchange between the stream and bed. These results highlight the important role of weak, upward density gradients in modulating hyporheic flow. Citation: Jin, G., H. Tang, L. Li, and D. A.

20,"Jaeger, A",Jun 22 2021 ,Transformation of organic micropollutants along hyporheic flow in bedforms of river-simulating flumes,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Urban streams receive increasing loads of organic micropollutants from treated wastewaters. A comprehensive understanding of the in-stream fate of micropollutants is thus of high interest for water quality management. Bedforms induce pumping effects considerably contributing to whole stream hyporheic exchange and are hotspots of biogeochemical turnover processes. However, little is known about the transformation of micropollutants in such structures. In the present study, we set up recirculating flumes to examine the transformation of a set of micropollutants along single flowpaths in two triangular bedforms. We sampled porewater from four locations in the bedforms over 78 days and analysed the resulting concentration curves using the results of a hydrodynamic model in combination with a reactive transport model accounting for advection, dispersion, first-order removal and retardation. The four porewater sampling locations were positioned on individual flowpaths with median solute travel times ranging from 11.5 to 43.3 h as shown in a hydrodynamic model previously. Highest stability was estimated for hydrochlorothiazide on all flowpaths. Lowest detectable half-lives were estimated for sotalol (0.7 h) and sitagliptin (0.2 h) along the shortest flowpath. Also, venlafaxine, acesulfame, bezafibrate, irbesartan, valsartan, ibuprofen and naproxen displayed lower half-lives at shorter flowpaths in the first bedform. However, the behavior of many compounds in the second bedform deviated from expectations, where particularly transformation products, e.g. valsartan acid, showed high concentrations. Flowpath-specific behavior as observed for metformin or flume-specific behavior as observed for metoprolol acid, for instance, was attributed to potential small-scale or flume-scale heterogeneity of microbial community compositions, respectively. The results of the study indicate that the shallow hyporheic flow field and the small-scale heterogeneity of the microbial community are major controlling factors for the transformation of relevant micropollutants in river sediments.Show less"

In anoxic sediments of a sulfate-impacted wetland-stream system in Minnesota (USA), a reactive transport model calibrated to geochemical observations predicted sulfate reduction to be the major terminal electron accepting process, and it showed that anaerobic oxidation of methane predominantly coupled with sulfate reduction attenuated methane concentrations near the sediment-water interface. Consistent with model results, 16S rRNA microbiome analysis revealed a high relative abundance of taxa capable of dissimilatory sulfate reduction. It further supported the conclusion that high simulated sulfate reduction rates could be maintained by a ""cryptic"" sulfur cycle coupled to iron and methane. Low relative abundance of known iron reducing bacteria raised the possibility of abiotic ferric iron (Fe) reduction driving sulfide reoxidation to intermediate-valence sulfur forms; widespread potential for microbially mediated disproportionation, oxidation, and reduction of sulfur intermediates provided mechanisms for completing redox cycles; and archaea comprising up to 25% of the microbial community could include consortia capable of anaerobic oxidation of methane. These biogeochemical processes were found to be controlled by hyporheic fluxes. Lower-magnitude fluxes in wetland compared to channel sediments created sharper geochemical gradients that generated greater heterogeneity in microbial distributions and reaction rates. Changes in upward flux caused fluctuations in sulfate concentrations that led to alternating simulations of methane production and transport. Our work supports the importance of hyporheic flux-driven iron-sulfur-methane cycling in sulfate-impacted wetlands and prompts further investigations under freshwater conditions.Key PointsReactive transport model and microbiome analysis quantify and describe hyporheic flux-driven Fe-S-CH 4 processes in sulfate-impacted wetlands Cryptic S cycling, coupled to Fe reduction and anaerobic CH 4 oxidation and involving S intermediates, may drive high sulfate reduction rates Dynamic hyporheic fluxes control spatial distributions of microbial compositions and spatiotemporal distributions of reaction ratesShow less"
22,"Callister, R",2020 ,RobustRepStream: Robust stream clustering using self-controlled connectivity graph,INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS,"A major challenge in stream clustering is the evolution in the statistical properties of the underlying data. As clustering is inherently unsupervised, selecting suitable parameter values is often difficult. Clustering algorithms with sensitive parameters are often not robust to such changes, leading to poor clustering outputs. Algorithms using K-NN graphs face this problem, as they have a sensitive K-connectivity parameter which prohibits them from adapting to stream concept evolution. We address this by controlling the excess of the skewness of edge length distributions in the underlying K-NN graph by introducing novel skewness excess concept. We demonstrate the asymptotic linear dependency of skewness excess against the graph connectivity and propose the novel RobustRepStream algorithm, which extends the RepStream algorithm, and provides improved robustness against stream evolution. By automatically controlling the skewness excess, the user no longer needs to specify the K-connectivity parameter, and RobustRepStream can adjust the graph connectivity locally in order to achieve performance close to when the optimal K value is known. We demonstrate that RobustRepStream's skewness threshold parameter is insensitive and universal across all data sets. We comprehensively evaluate RobustRepStream on real-world benchmark data sets against previous stream clustering algorithms, and demonstrate that it provides better clustering performance.Show less"
23,"Min, LL",Feb 2020 ,Numerical Approaches for Estimating Daily River Leakage from Arid Ephemeral Streams,WATER,"Despite the significance of river leakage to riparian ecosystems in arid/semi-arid regions, a true understanding and the accurate quantification of the leakage processes of ephemeral rivers in these regions remain elusive. In this study, the patterns of river infiltration and the associated controlling factors in an approximately 150-km section of the Donghe River (lower Heihe River, China) were revealed using a combination of field investigations and modelling techniques. The results showed that from 21 April 2010 to 7 September 2012, river water leakage accounted for 33% of the total river runoff in the simulated segments. A sensitivity analysis showed that the simulated infiltration rates were most sensitive to the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and the maximum evapotranspiration (ET) rate. However, the river leakage rate, i.e., the ratio of the leakage volume to the total runoff volume, of a single runoff event relies heavily on the total runoff volume and river flow rate. In addition to the hydraulic parameters of riverbeds, the characteristics of ET parameters are equally important for quantifying the flux exchange between arid ephemeral streams and underlying aquifers. Coupled surface/groundwater models, which aim to estimate river leakage, should consider riparian zones because these areas play a dominant role in the formation of leakage from the river for recharging via ET. The results of this paper can be used as a reference for water resource planning and management in regulated river basins to help maintain riparian ecosystems in arid regions.Show less"
24,"Navel, S",Jan 2013 ,New methods for the investigation of leaf litter breakdown in river sediments,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The breakdown rate of leaf litter buried inside river sediments (i.e., in the hyporheic zone) remains poorly known. The burial of large bags (15 x 15 cm) used in the benthic layer generates disturbances of the vertical connectivity with surface water, and thus affects the breakdown rate. We performed field and laboratory experiments to test the suitability of two leaf litter containers: small litter bags (5 x 4 cm) and perforated stainless steel cylinders (6 cm long, 1.6 cm in diameter), both introduced inside sediments using mobile mini-piezometers (1 m long, 1.7 cm or 3 cm in diameter). We compared the two containers for (i) the hydrological exchanges toward leaf litter, (ii) the impact of a benthic shredder on leaf breakdown, and (iii) the response of leaf litter breakdown to changes in sediment characteristics. The two methods give similar patterns of breakdown rates with stream sediment characteristics, but the use of perforated stainless steel cylinders provides an artificial empty volume in which invertebrates can over degrade leaf litter. Small plastic bags do not alter physico-chemical conditions around leaf litter and give lower values of breakdown rates in the hyporheic zone.Show less"
25,"Liu, MY",Apr 10 2021 ,Predicting the effective diffusivity across the sediment-water interface in rivers,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"Hyporheic exchange directly controls and regulates the transport of nutrients, heat, and organic matter across the sediment-water interface (SWI), thereby affecting the biochemical processes in rivers, which is critical for maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. The interface exchange is controlled by multiple processes, including physical, chemical, and biological processes, which can be modeled by the effective diffusion model using an effective diffusion coefficient, Deff, to quantify the hyporheic exchange rate. In this study, genetic programming (GP), a machine learning (ML) technique based on natural selection, is adopted to search for a robust relationship between the effective diffusion coefficient and surface flow conditions, bedforms, and sediment characteristics on the basis of published broad interfacial mass exchange flux measurements. By utilizing a data set covering a wide range of environmental condition parameters, the effective diffusion coefficient prediction models for the SWI with and without bedforms are developed. Results show that the dimensionless effective diffusion coefficient is not only related to the permeability Reynolds number, ReK, but also to the channel Reynolds number, Re. Compared with the flat bed, ReK has a greater effect on the hyporheic exchange when bedforms present at the SWI by affecting the pumping advection strength. The new Deff predictor with a relatively concise form exhibits considerable improvements with regard to prediction ability and is physically sound relative to the existing predictors.

In an in situ field study, the distribution of benthic and hyporheic invertebrates in the heads (downwelling) and tails (upwelling) of riffles were examined during stable baseflow conditions. Riffle heads were found to contain a greater proportion of interstitial fine sediment than riffle tails. Significant differences in the composition of benthic communities were associated with the amount of fine sediment. Riffle tail habitats supported a greater abundance and diversity of invertebrates sensitive to fine sediment such as EPT taxa. Shredder feeding taxa were more abundant in riffle heads suggesting greater availability of organic matter. In contrast, no significant differences in the hyporheic community were recorded between riffle heads and tails. We hypothesise that clogging of hyporheic interstices with fine sediments may have resulted in the homogenisation of the invertebrate community by limiting faunal movement into the hyporheic zone at both the riffle heads and tails. The results suggest that vertical hydrological exchange significantly influences the distribution of fine sediment and macroinvertebrate communities at the riffle scale.Show less"

Patch composition and configuration affects both the form of transported materials and the amount of nutrient retention and export. We describe spatial patterns of nutrients in the surface water of an arid-land stream using surveys conducted at 3 different scales, ranging from 30 m to 10 km in extent and from 1 m to 25 m in grain. We then relate these patterns to connections with subsurface patches at channel subunit, channel unit, and reach scales. Our objectives were to compare spatial variation in nutrients across scales, to determine the causes of downstream changes in nutrient concentration in terms of intervening patches, and to investigate whether subsurface patches at different scales behaved similarly in terms of net nutrient processing.Nutrients varied spatially at all scales sampled. The highest variation was observed in nitrate-N (NO3,-N) in the survey with the smallest grain (CV = 161%) and the lowest was observed ed in soluble reactive P (SRP) in the same survey (CV = 17%). We hypothesized that downstream changes in nutrient concentrations were caused by upwelling of high-nutrient water from the subsurface To test this hypothesis, we identified locations of hydrologic inputs to surface water from the subsurface using geomorphic features of the stream such as gravel bar edges (channel subunit scale), riffle-run transitions (channel unit scale), and permanent groundwater sources (reach scale). As surface water passed over these locations, nutrient concentrations generally increased, particularly during late succession when subsurface patches acted as sources of NO3-N at all 3 scales and as sources of SRP at the channel unit and reach scales. A hierarchical approach allowed us to decompose effects of subsurface upwellings at different scales and to consider interactions between them. Processes occurring in subsurface patches influenced surface water nutrient patterns at scales from a few meters to several kilometers.Show less"

Here, we conducted field and laboratory experiments (slow-filtration columns and stream-simulating microcosms) to test the following hypotheses: (i) that the hyporheic habitat acting as a physical sieve for spores filters out unsuccessful strategists from a potential species pool, (ii) that decreased pore size in sediments reduces species dispersal efficiency in the interstitial water, and (iii) that the physicochemical conditions prevailing in the hyporheic habitat will influence fungal community structure. Our field study showed that spore abundance and species diversity were consistently reduced in the interstitial water compared with surface water within three differing streams. Significant differences occurred among aquatic hyphomycetes, with dispersal efficiency of filiform-spore species being much higher than those with compact or branched/tetraradiate spores. This pattern was remarkably consistent with those found in laboratory experiments that tested the influence of sediment pore size on spore dispersal in microcosms. Furthermore, leaves inoculated in a stream and incubated in slow-filtration columns exhibited a fungal assemblage dominated by only two species, while five species were codominant on leaves from the stream-simulating microcosms. Results of this study highlight that the hyporheic zone exerts two types of selection pressure on the aquatic hyphomycete community, a physiological stress and a physical screening of the benthic spore pool, both leading to drastic changes in the structure of fungal community.Show less"
32,"Ginders, MA",Oct 2016 ,Influence of Hydrological Connectivity on Plankton Communities in Natural and Reconstructed Side-Arms of a Large New Zealand River,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"We sampled natural and reconstructed side-arms during different stages of hydrological connectivity with a large floodplain river in northern New Zealand, to determine whether re-establishment of connectivity would be an effective strategy for restoring plankton communities in former side-arms. Connectivity between side-arms and the river was moderated by water level and influenced flow rates and closure of inlets and outlets. Physicochemical conditions were more strongly related to the connectivity phase than to habitat type (river, natural or reconstructed side-arm), except during low connectivity when natural side-arms in particular were characterised by higher ammonium (NH4-N) and total phosphorus (P) concentrations, as well as specific conductivity. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (PO4-P), water temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen were identified as explanatory variables of phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition, which along with total nitrogen (phytoplankton) or total suspended solids (zooplankton) explained 44-52% of variation. Phytoplankton community composition and the abundance of several dominant or discriminatory taxa were affected by connectivity but not habitat type, whereas habitat and connectivity both had significant effects on zooplankton communities and abundances of the cladoceran Bosmina meridionalis. Significant interactions between connectivity and paired habitat types occurred for abundances of the diatom Asterionella, the cryptophyte Cryptomonas, the rotifer Synchaeta oblonga and cyclopoid copepods, reflecting differential responses to connectivity among habitats by these taxa. Overall, these results underscore the importance of hydrological connectivity between side-arms and rivers in moderating plankton community composition, and highlight unpredictable trajectories of community development and alternative transient states that can occur soon after side-arm reconnection.

33,"Constantz, J",Mar 2016 ,Groundwater exchanges near a channelized versus unmodified stream mouth discharging to a subalpine lake,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The terminus of a stream flowing into a larger river, pond, lake, or reservoir is referred to as the stream-mouth reach or simply the stream mouth. The terminus is often characterized by rapidly changing thermal and hydraulic conditions that result in abrupt shifts in surface water/groundwater (sw/gw) exchange patterns, creating the potential for unique biogeochemical processes and ecosystems. Worldwide shoreline development is changing stream-lake interfaces through channelization of stream mouths, i.e., channel straightening and bank stabilization to prevent natural meandering at the shoreline. In the central Sierra Nevada (USA), Lake Tahoe's shoreline has an abundance of both unmodified (i.e., not engineered though potentially impacted by broader watershed engineering) and channelized stream mouths. Two representative stream mouths along the lake's north shore, one channelized and one unmodified, were selected to compare and contrast water and heat exchanges. Hydraulic and thermal properties were monitored during separate campaigns in September 2012 and 2013 and sw/gw exchanges were estimated within the stream mouth-shoreline continuum. Heat-flow and water-flow patterns indicated clear differences in the channelized versus the unmodified stream mouth. For the channelized stream mouth, relatively modulated, cool-temperature, low-velocity longitudinal streambed flows discharged offshore beneath warmer buoyant lakeshore water. In contrast, a seasonal barrier bar formed across the unmodified stream mouth, creating higher-velocity subsurface flow paths and higher diurnal temperature variations relative to shoreline water. As a consequence, channelization altered sw/gw exchanges potentially altering biogeochemical processing and ecological systems in and near the stream mouth.Show less"

In this study, a two-dimensional hydraulic modelling approach is presented to evaluate flow connectivity in relation to passage requirements of adult steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in coastal California streams. High-resolution topographic data of stream reaches with distinct channel morphology were collected using terrestrial light detection and ranging surveys and linked with water surface measurements to calibrate hydraulic model simulations. Quantitative metrics of longitudinal flow connectivity were developed to assess fish passage suitability in relation to stream discharge. Measured flow data from the 20082009 winter season and simulated long-term records indicated that suitable passage flows occur with relatively low frequency and duration at all sites, suggesting that instream flow protections for fish passage are warranted. Results from the hydraulic modelling simulations were then compared with two alternative methods for assessing passage flows. A regional formula used by the State of California to identify minimum instream flow needs provided conservative estimates of passage flow requirements, whereas an approach based on riffle crest water depths underestimated flow needs. The hydraulic modelling approach appears well suited for simulating flows for fish passage studies and may be particularly useful for testing alternative environmental flow assessment methods and evaluating habitatflow relationships in stream reaches of importance, such as critical habitat for threatened fish species.

Dynamic hydrologic conditions and anthropogenic pollution can impact redox gradients and biogeochemical response, although few studies examine the resulting hydrobiogeochemical interactions generated within the hyporheic zone. This study examines the effect of hyporheic flux dynamics and anthropogenic sulfate loading on the biogeochemistry of a riparian wetland and stream system. The hydrologic gradient as well as sediment, surface water, and porewater geochemistry chemistry was characterized at multiple points throughout the 2017 spring-summer-fall season at a sulfate-impacted stream flanked by wetlands in northern Minnesota. Results show that organic-rich sediments largely buffer the geochemical responses to brief or low magnitude changes in hydrologic gradient, but sustained or higher magnitude fluxes may variably alter the redox regime and, ultimately, the environmental geochemistry. This has implications for a changing climate that is expected to dramatically alter the hydrological cycle. Further, increased sulfate loading and dissolved or adsorbed ferric iron complexes in the hyporheic zone may induce a cryptic sulfur cycle linked to iron and carbon cycling, as indicated by the abundance of intermediate valence sulfur compounds (e.g., polysulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate) throughout the anoxic wetland and stream-channel sediment column. The observed deviation from a classical redox tower coupled with potential changes in hydraulic gradient in these organic-rich wetland and stream hyporheic zones has implications for nutrient, trace element, and greenhouse gas fluxes into surface water and groundwater, ultimately influencing water quality and global climate.Show less"

The weathering of unconsolidated aquifer materials, derived from mine waste piles, consists of As-bearing minerals including arsenopyrite, scorodite, and iron oxides, providing a continuous source of As to water. Arsenic loads from the stream, springs, and groundwater were quantified at the study reach on nine dates from January to August 2005, and a mass balance approach was used to determine hyporheic storage of As. Loading from groundwater was the dominant source of As to the stream, while loads from springs represented a substantial proportion of the As load during spring. Arsenic loads in surface and groundwater were significantly elevated during summer despite lower discharge; groundwater load was positively correlated to aquifer temperature. The hyporheic zone retained As in the upstream-most subreach, most likely through the adsorption of As onto hyporheic sediments. In downstream subreaches, hyporheic sediments, derived from mine-tailing piles of high As content, were sources of As to the stream. Spatial variation in sediment source and composition reflecting flood transport from upstream and mass wasting of mine tailings, along with temporal changes in hydrology, combine to dictate the role of the hyporheic zone in the transport and retention of As.Show less"

38,"Naranjo, RC",Sep 2015 ,Mixing effects on nitrogen and oxygen concentrations and the relationship to mean residence time in a hyporheic zone of a riffle-pool sequence,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Flow paths and residence times in the hyporheic zone are known to influence biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification. The exchange across the sediment-water interface may involve mixing of surface water and groundwater through complex hyporheic flow paths that contribute to highly variable biogeochemically active zones. Despite the recognition of these patterns in the literature, conceptualization and analysis of flow paths and nitrogen transformations beneath riffle-pool sequences often neglect to consider bed form driven exchange along the entire reach. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) were monitored in the hyporheic zone beneath a riffle-pool sequence on a losing section of the Truckee River, NV. Spatially varying hyporheic exchange and the occurrence of multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells are shown to influence concentrations of DO and NO3- and the mean residence time (MRT) of riffle and pool areas. Distinct patterns observed in piezometers are shown to be influenced by the first large flow event following a steady 8 month period of low flow conditions. Increases in surface water discharge resulted in reversed hydraulic gradients and production of nitrate through nitrification at small vertical spatial scales (0.10-0.25 m) beneath the sediment-water interface. In areas with high downward flow rates and low MRT, denitrification may be limited. The use of a longitudinal two-dimensional flow model helped identify important mechanisms such as multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells and spatially varying MRT, an important driver for nitrogen transformation in the riverbed. Our observations of DO and NO3- concentrations and model simulations highlight the role of multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells on MRT and nitrogen transformations in the hyporheic zone of riffle-pool sequences.Show less"

Hydrologic flow between a downwelling and an upwelling zone beneath a riffle-pool sequence promoted hyporheic-ground-water interaction and differentiated regions of increased bacterial activity, production, turnover time, and responsiveness to dissolved organic carbon enrichment. Large gaps in knowledge exist on the structure and function of fungal, bacterial, microalgal, protozoan, and micrometazoan assemblages within hyporheic zones. This study, combined with available literature on surface and groundwater microbial assemblages, generated several hypotheses for future research.

40,"Czapiga, MJ",Sep 2015 ,Internal connectivity of meandering rivers: Statistical generalization of channel hydraulic geometry,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The geometry of rivers has been characterized in terms of downstream and at-a-station hydraulic geometry, based on individual cross sections. Such analyses do not, however, provide insight as to how these cross sections are connected. We generalize the concept of hydraulic geometry, using data on bathymetry from four reaches of meandering rivers that include at least five bends. We quantify connectivity in terms of the probability that a connected path exists such that a given attribute remains within specified bounds along it. While the concept is general, here we apply it to vessel navigability. We develop a predictor for navigability in meandering rivers, which requires only the following, relatively easily obtained input: vessel draft, vessel width, bankfull depth, bankfull width, relative difference between current and bankfull water surface elevation, and length of desired navigation path. The predictor is applicable to both bankfull and below-bankfull stage. A key input parameter is the standard deviation of the probability distribution of depth. This parameter, in and of itself, yields no information on connectivity as it does not capture the spatial orientation of depth variation. We find, however, that (a) the probability function for connectivity does depend on this parameter, and (b) its use allows for an approximate similarity collapse of the probability function, so providing a quasi-universal predictive relation applying to all four reaches. The results also suggest potential application to more complex forms for connectivity that involve other or multiple in-stream physical variables.Show less"

Natural and human-induced disturbances that alter sediment regimes can have cascading effects on river and floodplain morphology, ecosystems, and a river's ability to provide ecosystem services, yet prediction of the response of sediment dynamics to disturbance is challenging. We developed the Sediment Routing and Floodplain Exchange (SeRFE) model, which is a network-based, spatially explicit framework for modeling sediment recruitment to and subsequent transport through drainage networks. SeRFE additionally tracks the spatially and temporally variable balance between sediment supply and transport capacity. Simulations using SeRFE can account for various types of watershed disturbance and for channel-floodplain sediment exchange. SeRFE is simple, adaptable, and can be run with widely available geospatial data and limited field data. The model is driven by real or user-generated hydrographs, allowing the user to assess the combined effects of disturbance, channel-floodplain interactions and particular flow scenarios on the propagation of disturbances throughout a drainage network, and the resulting impacts to reaches of interest. We tested the model in the Santa Clara River basin, Southern California, in subbasins affected by large dams and wildfire. Model results highlight the importance of hydrologic conditions on postwildfire sediment yield and illustrate the spatial extent of dam-induced sediment deficit during a flood. SeRFE can provide contextual information on reach-scale sediment balance conditions, sensitivity to altered sediment regimes, and potential for morphologic change for managers and practitioners working in disturbed watersheds.Show less"
42,"Chen, C",May 2015 ,Using the level set method to study the effects of heterogeneity and anisotropy on hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The level set method was used to simulate the interface movement when a conservative solute migrated from stream water to subsurface water, and study the effects of streambed heterogeneity and anisotropy on solute penetration. The level set method is a numerical technique for tracking moving interfaces based on the idea that the interface is a level set curve of a higher-dimensional function. Numerical simulations were compared to experiments conducted in a recirculating flume. Streambed heterogeneity led to water exchange between multiple bed forms, while in homogeneous streambeds the water exchange was restricted within a single bed form. A thin layer of homogeneous sediments at the top of the heterogeneous streambeds significantly increased the interfacial water influx, resulting in faster solute penetration and stream concentration decrease. Streambed heterogeneity generated horizontal preferential flow paths in the upper part of the bed while decreasing pore water velocities deeper in the bed, which hindered vertical penetration and consequently led to slower stream concentration decrease. Decreasing vertical permeability or increasing horizontal permeability led to slower vertical penetration and stream concentration decrease. Decreasing vertical permeability had a much more significant impact on solute penetration than increasing horizontal permeability, because mass transfer in hyporheic exchange is greatly dominated by vertical advection which depends primarily on the vertical permeability. This study was the first to apply the level set method in the study of hyporheic exchange. The theoretical and numerical methods have important applications in subsurface flow and transport processes.Show less"

This location is often difficult and time-consuming when long river sectors are considered. We studied a 13 km-long sector of the Ceze River (Southern France) located in a karstic canyon. We compared five indicators of river-groundwater exchanges: longitudinal profiles of temperature, electrical conductivity and Rn-222 concentrations in the surface water of the river, chemical characteristics of the hyporheic water and hyporheic biodiversity. Upwelling zones occurred downstream of geomorphological heterogeneities (here at the tail of gravel bars). Surface water chemistry, especially electrical conductivity and Rn-222 concentrations, clearly traces large scale gaining sections, which were not associated to valley narrowing but with lateral springs, suggesting a crucial role of the geological structuration of the karstic plateau of Mejanne-le-Clap. Hyporheic water chemistry fits with the large-scale hydrological pattern, but with a high variability corresponding to local heterogeneities. The stygobite fauna (obligate groundwater organisms) and benthic EPTC (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera) occurred preferentially in the gaining sections fed by groundwater, likely because of oligotrophic water and cooler temperature. The spatial distribution of river-groundwater exchange zone and hyporheic biodiversity may be thus predicted using changes in surface water chemistry, especially for electrical conductivity and Rn-222 concentrations.

45,"Crook, KE",Sep-oct 2009 ,A method to assess longitudinal riverine connectivity in tropical streams dominated by migratory biota,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,"1. One way in which dams affect ecosystem function is by altering the distribution and abundance of aquatic species.2. Previous studies indicate that migratory shrimps have significant effects on ecosystem processes in Puerto Rican streams, but are vulnerable to impediments to upstream or downstream passage, such as dams and associated water intakes where stream water is withdrawn for human water supplies. Ecological effects of dams and water withdrawals from streams depend on spatial context and temporal variability of flow in relation to the amount of water withdrawn.3. This paper presents a conceptual model for estimating the probability that an individual shrimp is able to migrate from a stream's headwaters to the estuary as a larva, and then return to the headwaters as a juvenile, given a set of dams and water withdrawals in the stream network. The model is applied to flow and withdrawal data for a set of dams and water withdrawals in the Caribbean National Forest (CNF) in Puerto Rico.4. The index of longitudinal riverine connectivity (ILRC), is used to classify 17 water intakes in streams draining the CNF as having low, moderate, or high connectivity in terms of shrimp migration in both directions. An in-depth comparison of two streams showed that the stream characterized by higher water withdrawal had low connectivity, even during wet periods. Severity of effects is illustrated by a drought year, where the most downstream intake caused 100% larval shrimp mortality 78% of the year.5. The ranking system provided by the index can be used as a tool for conservation ecologists and water resource managers to evaluate the relative vulnerability of migratory biota in streams, across different scales (reach-network), to seasonally low flows and extended drought. This information can be used to help evaluate the environmental tradeoffs of future water withdrawals. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"

Several previous studies have demonstrated that bed form-induced advective flows (pumping) and scour/deposition of bed sediments (turnover) will often be the dominant processes controlling local exchange with the streambed. A new model is presented for combined turnover and pumping exchange due to relatively fast-moving bed forms, i.e., when turnover dominates the exchange in the upper part of the bed where active bed sediment transport occurs. While turnover rapidly mixes the upper layer of the bed, advective pumping produces exchange with the deeper, unscoured region of the subsurface. The net exchange due to these processes was analyzed using fundamental hydraulic principles: the initial exchange was calculated using an existing geometric model for turnover, and then the later exchange was determined by analyzing the advective flow induced under the moving bed form field. The exchange of colloidal particles due to moving bed forms was also modeled by considering the further effects of particle settling and filtration in the subsurface. Experiments were conducted in a recirculating flume to evaluate solute (conservative Li+) and colloid (kaolinite) exchange with a sand bed. The solute and colloid exchange models performed well for fast-moving bed forms, but underpredicted the colloid exchanges observed with lower rates of bed sediment transport. For very slowly moving bed forms it was found that turnover could be completely neglected, and observed colloid exchanges were represented well by a pure pumping model. In the intermediate case where turnover and pumping rates are similar, water carried into the bed by turnover is immediately released by pumping, and vice versa. Thus, while this work further elucidated the basic processes controlling solute and colloid exchange with a bed covered by bed forms and provided a fundamental model for exchange due to fast-moving bed forms, exchange in the intermediate case where turnover and pumping tend to compete can only be bounded by current models.Show less"
47,"Gao, YQ",,Change of stream network connectivity under polder-type flood control measure,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Polder is usually used for flood control in the river delta area. With the rapid development of urbanization, the dikes or pumps cut the original stream network system, and the stream network connectivity (SNC) and the river system pattern have changed. The dikes or pumps generally force up the river's water level, and regional flood formation mechanisms and processes have changed. In order to quantitatively describe the characteristics of polder-type flood control measure (PFCM) and the change law of SNC, firstly, the streams inside polders were generalized as virtual streams, a hydrological-hydrodynamic model was constructed by connecting Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System and MIKE11 model. Secondly, an SNC evaluation model was constructed based on flow resistance and hydrological process. Finally, the SNC under different scenarios was simulated and evaluated to reveal the influence of the PFCM on SNC. And the dominance analysis method obtained the main control factors of SNC changes. The results showed that the pumps as the main drainage facility under the PFCM, SNC after the opening of the pumps were increased by 0.060, 0.103, and 0.311 for 50%, 30%, and 3% frequency flood scales compared with the pumps closed, respectively. However, compared with the natural stream (without the PFCM), the SNC decreased by 0.391, 0.456, and 0.487, respectively, at the same time of the same flood scale. The PFCM negatively impacted the SNC, and the number of pumps was the main control factor of the SNC.Show less"
48,"Wlostowski, AN",Aug 15 2016 ,"Patterns of hydrologic connectivity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: a synthesis of 20years of hydrologic data",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica moderate an important hydrologic and biogeochemical connection between upland alpine glaciers, valley-bottom soils, and lowland closed-basin lakes. Moreover, MDV streams are simple but dynamic systems ideal for studying interacting hydrologic and ecological dynamics. This work synthesizes 20years of hydrologic data, collected as part of the MDVs Long-Term Ecological Research project, to assess spatial and temporal dynamics of hydrologic connectivity between glaciers, streams, and lakes. Long-term records of stream discharge (Q), specific electrical conductance (EC), and water temperature (T) from 18 streams were analysed in order to quantify the magnitude, duration, and frequency of hydrologic connections over daily, annual, and inter-annual timescales. At a daily timescale, we observe predictable diurnal variations in Q, EC, and T. At an annual timescale, we observe longer streams to be more intermittent, warmer, and have higher median EC values, compared to shorter streams. Longer streams also behave chemostatically with respect to EC, whereas shorter streams are more strongly characterized by dilution. Inter-annually, we observe significant variability in annual runoff volumes, likely because of climatic variability over the 20 record years considered. Hydrologic connections at all timescales are vital to stream ecosystem structure and function. This synthesis of hydrologic connectivity in the MDVs provides a useful end-member template for assessing hydrologic connectivity in more structurally complex temperate watersheds.

49,"Li, SL",Aug 2021 ,"Hyporheic zone geochemistry of a multi-aquifer system used for managed aquifer recharge in Beijing, China",APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"Hyporheic groundwater geochemistry evolution depends on the interactions of surface water and groundwater (SW-GW). Hydrodynamic variations driven by the long-term managed aquifer recharge (MAR) practice could change hyporheic geochemical processes, which requires a better understanding for groundwater management. In this work, a geochemical survey was conducted in a multi-aquifer MAR system. The results showed great impact of the MAR practice on the hydrodynamics and major ion chemistry of groundwater in the hyporheic zone compared to natural recharge. Besides, related geochemical processes including rock weathering and ion exchange showed increased effect on hyporheic hydrochemistry with aquifer depth, depending on hydrogeological conditions in addition to river water infiltration. Combined with hydrochemical indicators and the end-member mixing model, the relative contribution of precipitation to groundwater was estimated to be 5% for the 30-m aquifer, 16% for the 50-m aquifer, and 64% for the 80-m aquifer. However, precipitation made small contributions (<5%) to the major ions of groundwater regardless of depth. Conversely, the relative contributions of river water infiltration decreased with aquifer depth (95%-> 84%-> 36%), and its proportional contributions to major ions showed a similar trend (90%-> 84%-> 39%), which suggests reduced SW-GW interaction intensity with depth in the hyporheic zone. The major ion compositions of hyporheic groundwater tend towards river water after the long-term MAR practice, reflecting comprehensive effect of mixing and related geochemical processes. This study demonstrates the relevance of detailed studies at regional scale to understand anthropogenic effects from projects such as MAR on groundwater geochemistry especially in multi-aquifer systems.Show less"
