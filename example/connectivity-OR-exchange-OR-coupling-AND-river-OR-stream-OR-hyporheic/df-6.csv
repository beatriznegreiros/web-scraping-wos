These daily pulses modulate fluid exchange and residence times in the hyporheic zone where biogeochemical reactions are typically pronounced. The effects of a small flood pulse under low-flow conditions on surface-water/groundwater exchange and biogeochemical processes were studied by monitoring and sampling from two dense transects of wells perpendicular to the river. The first transect recorded water levels and the second transect was used for water sample collection at three depths. Samples were collected from 12 wells every 2 h over a 24-h period which had a 16-cm flood pulse. Analyses included nutrients, carbon, major ions, and stable isotopes of water. The relatively small flood pulse did not cause significant mixing in the parafluvial zone. Under these conditions, the river and groundwater were decoupled, showed potentially minimal mixing at the interface, and did not exhibit any discernible denitrification of river-borne nitrate. The chemical patterns observed in the parafluvial zone can be explained by evaporation of groundwater with little mixing with river water. Thus, large pulses may be necessary in order for substantial hyporheic mixing and exchange to occur. The large regulated river under a low-flow and small flood pulse regime functioned mainly as a gaining river with little hydrologic connectivity beyond a narrow hyporheic zone.Show less"
1,"Westhoff, MC",Oct 12 2011 ,Quantifying hyporheic exchange at high spatial resolution using natural temperature variations along a first-order stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange is an important process that underpins stream ecosystem function, and there have been numerous ways to characterize and quantify exchange flow rates and hyporheic zone size. The most common approach, using conservative stream tracer experiments and 1-D solute transport modeling, results in oversimplified representations of the system. Here we present a new approach to quantify hyporheic exchange and the size of the hyporheic zone (HZ) using high-resolution temperature measurements and a coupled 1-D transient storage and energy balance model to simulate in-stream water temperatures. Distributed temperature sensing was used to observe in-stream water temperatures with a spatial and temporal resolution of 2 and 3 min, respectively. The hyporheic exchange coefficient (which describes the rate of exchange) and the volume of the HZ were determined to range between 0 and 2.7 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 0 and 0.032 m(3) m(-1), respectively, at a spatial resolution of 1-10 m, by simulating a time series of in-stream water temperatures along a 565 m long stretch of a small first-order stream in central Luxembourg. As opposed to conventional stream tracer tests, two advantages of this approach are that exchange parameters can be determined for any stream segment over which data have been collected and that the depth of the HZ can be estimated as well. Although the presented method was tested on a small stream, it has potential for any stream where rapid (in regard to time) temperature change of a few degrees can be obtained.Show less"
2,"Frei, S",Aug 2015 ,FINIFLUX: An implicit finite element model for quantification of groundwater fluxes and hyporheic exchange in streams and rivers using radon,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A quantitative understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions is vital for sustainable management of water quantity and quality. The noble gas radon-222 (Rn) is becoming increasingly used as a sensitive tracer to quantify groundwater discharge to wetlands, lakes, and rivers: a development driven by technical and methodological advances in Rn measurement. However, quantitative interpretation of these data is not trivial, and the methods used to date are based on the simplest solutions to the mass balance equation (e.g., first-order finite difference and inversion). Here we present a new implicit numerical model (FINIFLUX) based on finite elements for quantifying groundwater discharge to streams and rivers using Rn surveys at the reach scale (1-50 km). The model is coupled to a state-of-the-art parameter optimization code Parallel-PEST to iteratively solve the mass balance equation for groundwater discharge and hyporheic exchange. The major benefit of this model is that it is programed to be very simple to use, reduces non-uniqueness, and provides numerically stable estimates of groundwater fluxes and hyporheic residence times from field data. FINIFLUX was tested against an analytical solution and then implemented on two German rivers of differing magnitude, the Salzach (similar to 112 m(3) s(-1)) and the Rote Main (similar to 4 m(3) s(-1)). We show that using previous inversion techniques numerical instability can lead to physically impossible negative values, whereas the new model provides stable positive values for all scenarios. We hope that by making FINIFLUX freely available to the community that Rn might find wider application in quantifying groundwater discharge to streams and rivers and thus assist in a combined management of surface and groundwater systems.Show less"
3,"Hester, ET",Jan 2009 ,The influence of in-stream structures on summer water temperatures via induced hyporheic exchange,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Temperature is an important controlling factor for ecological functions. In-stream geomorphic structures affect stream thermal regimes by facilitating hyporheic exchange of water and heat between stream channels and underlying sediments. We varied the height of an experimental weir (representing debris dams, log dams, and boulder weirs) in a small stream during the summer and monitored the hydraulic and thermal response of surface and subsurface water using a three-dimensional sensor array. The presence of the structure altered stream temperature patterns, increasing thermal heterogeneity in surface water and shallow sediments by up to similar to 1.0 degrees C. We estimated heat conduction and weir-induced hyporheic heat advection across the streambed, and evaluated their response to key parameters. Conduction and advection were of similar magnitude and oscillated over the stream's diel temperature cycle. Weir-induced hyporheic heat advection caused slight cooling of the surface stream (up to similar to 0.01 degrees C), and increased with weir height, but was considerably less important to the overall heat budget of the stream than was atmospheric heat exchange. Streambed hydraulic conductivity appears to be the overriding factor determining the magnitude of weir-induced hyporheic influence on surface water temperatures. We conclude that weir-type structures will induce ecologically significant surface and subsurface thermal heterogeneity in many stream settings, but that weir-induced hyporheic heat advection will have ecologically significant thermal effects on surface water only in coarse streambeds. Because these structures are common in natural streams and stream restoration projects, such thermal effects may be important on a landscape level.Show less"
4,"Allgeier, J",Aug 2021 ,Systematic Evaluation of Geometry-Driven Lateral River-Groundwater Exchange in Floodplains,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The widening and narrowing of river-valley aquifers can cause valley-scale lateral hyporheic exchange even if the river is straight and its slope is uniform. For the aforementioned system, we derive a semi-analytical solution describing steady-state groundwater flow for a simplified two-dimensional geometry of the aquifer and uniform lateral influx from hillslopes. We use this solution to evaluate the geometry-driven lateral hyporheic exchange flux between the aquifer and the river. By systematically varying the model parameters, we decipher how this flux and the area of the exchange zone depend on geometric (e.g., minimum and maximum domain width) and hydrogeological parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, ambient hydraulic gradient and lateral influxes). The results suggest pronounced hyporheic flow for cases with distinct widening behavior and small cross-sectional widths at the floodplain inlet and outlet. Furthermore, we analyze the travel-time distribution of water flowing through the exchange zone, which approximately follows a beta distribution. We express our findings in terms of simple proxy-equations that can be used to easily estimate the exchange flux, the area of the exchange zone, and the associated travel-time distribution for a given geographic/landscape setting.Show less"
5,"Hitt, NP",Jul 2008 ,River-stream connectivity affects fish bioassessment performance,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Stream fish bioassessment methods assume that fish assemblages observed in sample sites reflect responses to local stressors, but fish assemblages are influenced by local factors as well as regional dispersal to and from connected streams. We hypothesized that fish movement to and from refugia and source populations in connected rivers (i.e., riverine dispersal) would weaken or decouple relations between fish community metrics and local environmental conditions. We compared fish-environment relations between streams that flow into large rivers (mainstem tributaries) and streams that lack riverine confluences (headwater tributaries) at multiple spatial grains using data from the USEPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in the mid-Atlantic highlands, USA (n = 157 sites). Headwater and mainstem tributaries were not different in local environmental conditions, but showed important differences in fish metric responses to environmental quality gradients. Stream sites flowing into mainstem channels within 10 fluvial km showed consistently weaker relations to local environmental conditions than stream sites that lacked such mainstem connections. Moreover, these patterns diminished at longer distances from riverine confluences, consistent with the hypothesis of riverine dispersal. Our results suggest that (1) the precision of fish bioassessment metrics may be improved by calibrating scoring criteria based on the spatial position of sites within stream networks and (2) the spatial grain of fish bioassessment studies may be manipulated to suit objectives by including or excluding fishes exhibiting riverine dispersal.Show less"
6,"Jonsson, K",May 2004 ,Sorption behavior and long-term retention of reactive solutes in the hyporheic zone of streams,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,"This paper analyzes the transport of sorbing solutes by extending the advective storage path model developed for longitudinal transport of inert solutes in streams coupled with flow-induced uptake in the hyporheic zone. Independent observations of a conservative (H-3) and a reactive (Cr-51) tracer in both the stream water and the hyporheic zone were used to differentiate between hydraulic and sorption processes. The method of temporal moments was found to be inadequate for parameter determination, whereas fitting versus the entire tracer breakthrough curves with special emphasis on the tail indicates that the proposed model could be used to represent both conservative and reactive transport. Information on the tracer inventory of the conservative tracer in the hyporheic zone was found to be of vital importance to the evaluation of the hydraulic exchange. A model evaluation based on stream water data alone can yield predictions of a wash-out in the hyporheic zone that deviates markedly from the observed wash-out. This prohibits long-term predictions of the wash-out from the hyporheic zone as well as the evaluation of sorption properties. The sorption in the hyporheic zone was found to follow a two-step model, where the first step is instantaneous and the second kinetic. A model with a single-step sorption process could not reproduce the observed breakthrough curves. An evaluation of the relative importance of including sorption kinetics in solute stream transport models is elucidated by means of the analytical expressions for the temporal moments. The omission of the kinetics in the second sorption step in the hyporheic zone will result in relative errors in the moments of second order or higher. The error will increase with decreasing residence time in the hyporheic zone. Especially, long-term predictions of the wash-out from the hyporheic zone require consideration of the rate-limited sorption.Show less"
7,"Moren, I",Dec 2021 ,Cross-Validating Hydromechanical Models and Tracer Test Assessments of Hyporheic Exchange Flow in Streams With Different Hydromorphological Characteristics,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) can generally be quantified through two different approaches. The first approach, which is deductive, entails physically based models, supported with relevant observations. The second approach includes inductive assessments of stream tracer tests using solute transport models, which provide a useful mathematical framework that allows for upscaling of results, but included parameters often have a vague physical base, which limits the possibilities of generalizing results using independent hydromorphological observations. To better understand how the physical basis of HEF-quantifying parameters relates to stream hydromorphology at different spatial scales, we cross-validated the results from (a) tracer test assessments using a 1D solute transport model that accounts for HEF and (b) an independent hydromechanical model that represents HEF driven by multiscale pressure gradients along the streambed interface. To parameterize the models, topographical surveys, tracer tests, and streambed hydraulic conductivity measurements were performed in 10 stream reaches, differing in terms of geomorphology, slope, and discharge. The results show that the models were cross-validated in terms of the average exchange velocity, providing a plausible physical explanation for this parameter in small alluvial streams with low discharges, shallow depth, and moderate slopes. However, the hydromechanical model generally resulted in wider residence time distributions and occasionally higher average residence times compared to the tracer test assessments. From the cross-validated multiscale hydromechanical model, we learned that water surface profile variations were the main drivers of HEF in all investigated streams and that spatial scales between 20 cm and 5 m dominated the estimated HEF velocity.Show less"
8,"Hester, ET",May 2017 ,The importance and challenge of hyporheic mixing,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone is the interface beneath and adjacent to streams and rivers where surface water and groundwater interact. The hyporheic zone presents unique conditions for reaction of solutes from both surface water and groundwater, including reactions which depend upon mixing of source waters. Some models assume that hyporheic zones are well-mixed and conceptualize the hyporheic zone as a surface water-groundwater mixing zone. But what are the controls on and effects of hyporheic mixing? What specific mechanisms cause the relatively large (>approximate to 1 m) mixing zones suggested by subsurface solute measurements? In this commentary, we explore the various processes that might enhance mixing in the hyporheic zone relative to deeper groundwater, and pose the question whether the substantial mixing suggested by field studies may be due to the combination of fluctuating boundary conditions and multiscale physical and chemical spatial heterogeneity. We encourage investigation of hyporheic mixing using numerical modeling and laboratory experiments to ultimately inform field investigations.Plain Language Summary The hyporheic zone is the area beneath and adjacent to streams and rivers where surface water and groundwater interact. The hyporheic zone presents unique conditions for reaction of pollutants from both surface water and groundwater, including reactions which depend upon mixing of these different source waters. This type of mixing is not well understood, yet potentially important for pollutant mitigation in watersheds. In this commentary, we explore the various processes that might enhance mixing in the hyporheic zone relative to deeper groundwater, and pose the question whether the substantial mixing observed by field studies may be due to the combination of fluctuating boundary conditions and multi-scale physical and chemical spatial heterogeneity.

9,"Liu, YH",Jun 2020 ,Influence of Streambed Heterogeneity on Hyporheic Flow and Sorptive Solute Transport,WATER,"The subsurface region where river water and groundwater actively mix (the hyporheic zone) plays an important role in conservative and reactive solute transport along rivers. Deposits of high-conductivity (K) sediments along rivers can strongly control hyporheic processes by channeling flow along preferential flow paths wherever they intersect the channel boundary. Our goal is to understand how sediment heterogeneity influences conservative and sorptive solute transport within hyporheic zones containing high- and low-Ksediment facies types. The sedimentary architecture of high-Kfacies is modeled using commonly observed characteristics (e.g., volume proportion and mean length), and their spatial connectivity is quantified to evaluate its effect on hyporheic mixing dynamics. Numerical simulations incorporate physical and chemical heterogeneity by representing spatial variability in bothKand in the sediment sorption distribution coefficient (Kd). Sediment heterogeneity significantly enhances hyporheic exchange and skews solute breakthrough behavior, while in homogeneous sediments, interfacial flux and solute transport are instead controlled by geomorphology and local-scale riverbed topographies. The hyporheic zone is compressed in sediments with high sorptive capacity, which limits solute interactions to only a small portion of the sedimentary architecture and thus increases retention. Our results have practical implications for groundwater quality, including remediation strategies for contaminants of emerging concern.Show less"
10,"Marion, A",Sep 2005 ,Diffusive behavior of bedform-induced hyporheic-exchange in rivers,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,"Solute transport in natural streams is a complex phenomenon that involves both in-stream dispersion and mass exchange with the porous zones surrounding the water body., Due to the complex nature of the. riverine systems several models may be used to. simulate and analyze the transport of solutes with,different degrees of complexity. The bedform-induced hyporheic transport is a stream-subsurface exchange mechanism that can I be reproduced in controlled systems, such as laboratory flumes. Application of a simple Fickian diffusion model to laboratory data obtained with passive solutes and stationary bedforms proves successful within a range of durations of the contamination process. A dimensionless form of the diffusion coefficient, scaled with dynamic, physical, and geometric properties of the system is derived by comparison with another physically based model. A prediction of the dimensionless diffusion coefficient is obtained as a function of the timescale of the exchange process and is validated with a few sets of results from laboratory tests.Show less"
11,"Clinton, SM",Jun 2002 ,Forest-river interactions: Influence on hyporheic dissolved organic carbon concentrations in a floodplain terrace,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"In large floodplain rivers, hyporheic (subsurface) flowpaths transfer nutrients from productive riparian terraces to oligotrophic off-channel habitats. Because dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fuels microbial processes and hyporheic microorganisms represent the first stage of retention and transformation of these nutrients, understanding DOC flux can provide information on the constraints of microbial metabolism in the hyporheic zone of rivers, We monitored hydrology, physicochemical indicators, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics during low and high discharge periods in the hyporheic zone of a riparian terrace on the Queets River, Washington, to understand what processes control the supply of carbon to subsurface microbial communities. As discharge increased, terrace hyporheic, flowpaths changed from parallel to focused, and the location of surface water inputs to the terrace shifted from the terrace edge to head. Overall, DOC concentrations decreased along hyporheic flowpaths; however, concentrations at points along the flowpaths varied with position along the head gradient and age of the overlying vegetation. We estimated that there is insufficient DOC in advecting surface water to support hyporheic microbial metabolism in this riparian terrace, These trends indicate that there are additional carbon sources to the subsurface water, and we conclude that DOC is leaching from overlying riparian soils within the forest patches. Thus, subsurface DOC concentrations reflect a balance between surface water inputs, metabolic uptake, and allochthonous inputs from forest soils.Show less"
12,"Wang, NR",Dec 2018 ,Transverse hyporheic flow in the cross-section of a compound river system,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Previous studies of bedform-induced hyporheic flow focused on processes driven by longitudinal hydraulic head variations at the sediment-water interface (SWI) due to river flow and bedform interactions. By way of numerical simulations, we examined the transverse hyporheic flow in a river system with compound sections, comprising a main river channel and a floodplain connected by a bank. The results show that head fluctuations across the compound beds associated with the transverse secondary flow can cause significant lateral hyporheic flow through two pore water circulating cells. Such a 2-D compound bedfrom have a higher flux across the SWI than the 2-D longitudinal dunes since the 2-D compound cross-section form induces more drag. The circulating flow cells originate from the bank surface and terminate at the main channel and floodplain bed surfaces, respectively. The hyporheic exchange concentrates on the bank region below the SWI where an intensive solute transfer concurrently occurred. The head gradient along the SWI is sensitive to the bank slope angle, which consequently determines transverse hyporheic flow dynamics and solute transport processes. Larger bank slope angles induce higher hyporheic fluxes and smaller hyporheic areas and residence time. The effects of increasing flux on solute transport in the compound section are partly influenced by a sharply decreasing hyporheic area. Thus the solute consequently transfers downward within the hyporheic zone with a lower rate at larger bank slope angle. Larger river discharges may promote both the transverse hyporheic flow and solute transformation across the bed surface. These physical processes may have implications for the biogeochemical processing within the hyporheic zone across a compound river system.Show less"
13,"Grimaldi, C",Nov 2000 ,"Nitrate depletion during within-stream transport: Effects of exchange processes between streamwater, the hyporheic and riparian zones",WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"In regions with intensive agriculture and shallow hydrological systems, headstreams are often polluted with nitrate even at the springs. In North-West France, nitrate concentration was seen to decrease downstream during baseflow conditions when the stream flows on granite, but this does not occur on schist. In order to explain this difference in behaviour, we analysed the groundwaters and surveyed the redox conditions (using a field test for ferrous iron) in near-bank wet meadows as well as in the hyporheic zone. We show that the wet meadow groundwater was denitrified and that oxygen and nitrate were present around the stream channel in a wide zone on granite, compared with a very restricted zone on schist. On granite, exchanges between the stream and the hyporheic zone are favoured by sandy or peaty material having high hydraulic conductivity. This gives rise to two processes (1) lateral inflow of denitrified water from wet meadows, (2) in the opposite direction, supply of stream nitrate to denitrification sites in the hyporheic zone. In the second case, a high hydraulic conductivity also reduces the water residence time and limits denitrification, resulting in high levels of oxygen and nitrate. On schist, the low hydraulic conductivity prevents an efficient connection between surface and subsurface waters.Show less"
14,"Chen, Y",Nov 2019 ,Changes in river connectivity indexes in the lower Yellow River between 1960 and 2015,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Channel connectivity in the lower Yellow River has changed in recent decades as a result of climate change and human activities. Developing indexes that can be used to assess channel connectivity is a key issue in the lower Yellow River and beyond. We propose a suite of connectivity indexes based on several components of a river channel, including boundary, flow, and sediment indicators. Through an analysis of river connectivity over time in the lower Yellow River, we found that a decrease in precipitation was the main cause of poor river connectivity conditions in the 1990s. Since 1999, the year of impoundment of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, river connectivity has improved, as shown by boundary, sediment, and ecology indexes, as a result of reservoir operation and regulation. However, water diversion may increase channel sedimentation, leading to a decline in sediment connectivity. The suite of river connectivity indexes developed in this paper and applied to the Yellow River can be used in similar sediment-laden streams in other semiarid regions worldwide.Show less"

Collectively, these interconnected waters are called fluvial hydrosystems. Physical and chemical connectivity within fluvial hydrosystems is created by the transport of nonliving materials (e.g., water, sediment, nutrients, and contaminants) which either do or do not chemically change (chemical and physical connections, respectively). A substantial body of evidence unequivocally demonstrates physical and chemical connectivity between streams and riparian wetlands and downstream waters. Streams and riparian wetlands are structurally connected to downstream waters through the network of continuous channels and floodplain form that make these systems physically contiguous, and the very existence of these structures provides strong geomorphologic evidence for connectivity. Functional connections between streams and riparian wetlands and their downstream waters vary geographically and over time, based on proximity, relative size, environmental setting, material disparity, and intervening units. Because of the complexity and dynamic nature of connections among fluvial hydrosystem units, a complete accounting of the physical and chemical connections and their consequences to downstream waters should aggregate over multiple years to decades.Show less"
17,"Fowler, RT",Sep 2002 ,Influence of hydrologic exchange patterns on water chemistry and hyporheic invertebrate communities in three gravel-bed rivers,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"The influence of hydraulic exchange patterns on hyporheic water chemistry and invertebrate community composition was measured in three gravel-bed rivers of southern Hawke's Bay, North Island, New Zealand. Based on patterns reported overseas we predict that down-welling waters will be similar to surface waters in chemical characteristics and epigean animals will be more common in down-welling waters than in up-wellings, which would have a different chemical signature to the surface waters and a fauna dominated by hypogean invertebrates. Conductivity, pH, and temperature of hyporheic water were least like those of surface waters at up-wellings in the groundwater-fed Makaretu River. Only 6% of the invertebrate fauna of these up-wellings comprised epigean animals. In contrast, in the groundwater-recharging Tukituki and Waipawa Rivers, hyporheic water chemistry was similar to that of surface water in down-wellings and 40% of the community comprised epigean animals by abundance. Significant increases (P < 0.05) in species diversity and taxonomic richness was also identified in down-welling zones compared with up-wellings. Species diversity and taxonomic richness were lowest in up-wellings in the Makaretu where hypogean animals dominated the hyporheic fauna. Species diversity and taxonomic richness were higher in down-wellings than up-wellings because more epigean taxa were present.Show less"
18,"Soulsby, C",Nov-dec 2001 ,Hydrochemistry of the hyporheic zone in salmon spawning gravels: A preliminary assessment in a degraded agricultural stream,REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT,"Hydrochemical changes were monitored in a simulated, sea run salmon redd in a small agricultural stream in northeast Scotland following the 1998-1999 spawning season. Immediately after redd construction, the hydrochemical characteristics of hyporheic water, at depths of 0.1 m and 0.3 m, were very similar to stream water. These apparently well-mixed waters were alkaline, well-oxygenated and enriched in nutrients. In the weeks and months following redd construction, clear and statistically significant differences in the chemistry of stream and hyporheic waters were observed. Typically, hyporheic water had lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen (mean 7.35 mg L-1 at 0.3 m depth) than stream waters (mean = 11.26 mg L-1). Alkalinity, calcium, sulphate and conductivity levels tended to be higher in hyporheic waters, with concentrations increasing with depth. These data implied an increasing influence of groundwater with depth in the hyporheic zone following redd construction; an inference supported by subsequent hydraulic head measurements, which revealed an upwards groundwater flux in the stream bed. However, groundwater-surface water interactions were dynamic and complex: road salts eluted into the stream during periods of snowmelt simulated tracer experiments that implied that a reversed hydraulic gradient may occur at high flows with deeper streamwater penetration and mixing in the hyporheic zone. High flows also result in the mobilization of fine sediments from the stream bed which subsequently infiltrated into spawning gravels. These appear to cause `capping' of redds and probably reduce the hydraulic conductivity of the redd matrix. Infiltrating sediments also contain a small, but probably important organic component, the decomposition of which may contribute to oxygen consumption and nutrient mineralization in the hyporheic zone.

20,"Iepure, S",Dec 2014 ,"Geochemical, geological and hydrological influence on ostracod assemblages distribution in the hyporheic zone of two Mediterranean rivers in central Spain",INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY,"On the catchment spatial scale, rivers can be considered a patchy discontinuity from headwaters to mouth with significant implications on the structure and functioning of the hyporheic zone (HZ) biota. The present study aims to determine the spatial variation of ostracod assemblages from a fluvial HZ of two groundwater-fed rivers of the Jarama basin (Central Spain). We hypothesised that ostracod abundance and composition are subject to changes in water condition, substratum type geology and surface water/groundwater exchanges along the hyporheic flow path. Individual measures of 29 physico-chemical parameters, water discharge, sediment size and sediment organic matter (as loss of ignition) were measured at a depth of 20-40cm at 20 hyporheic sites of the Henares and Tajuna Rivers. The results show that factors like elevation, carbonate water type, high permeable riverbed substratum and groundwater upwelling at headwaters contribute to shape a diverse, mixed assemblage formed by stygophyle and stygoxene ostracods (14 species). Conversely, low-mineralised waters, siliceous riverbeds with poor permeability, and relatively low surface/ground water exchanges in the middle and lower sectors, limit species diversity and ostracod abundance to exclusively stygoxene elements (nine species). Ostracod abundance correlates positively with fine sands (0.125-0.25mm) (Spearman, r=0.70), and negatively with temperature (r=-0.40), SO42- (r=-0.45) and Mg2+ (r=-0.40). Trace metal (Cu, Mn, Ni) accumulation in the intermediate and lower sectors of both rivers appears harmful for Ilyocypris brady (r=-0.46) and Pryonocypris zenkeri (r=-0.40), whereas As relates negatively to the abundance of Candona candida (r=-0.51), Pryonocypris zenkeri (r=-0.60) and Herpetocypris brevicaudata (r=-0.72). The results highlight the significance of recent ostracods as a proxy to assess the water conditions in a HZ and to provide forthcoming approaches to depict surface-subsurface hydrological exchanges.Show less"
21,"Harjung, A",Apr 2019 ,Responses of microbial activity in hyporheic pore water to biogeochemical changes in a drying headwater stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Microbial heterotrophic activity is a major driver of nutrient and organic matter processing in the hyporheic zone of headwater streams. Additionally, the hyporheic zone might provide refuge for microbes when surface flow ceases during drought events. We investigated chemical (organic and inorganic nutrients) and microbiological parameters (bacterial cell concentration, live-dead ratios, and extracellular enzyme activities) of surface and interstitial pore water in a period of progressive surface-hyporheic disconnection due to summer drying. The special situation of the chosen study reach, where groundwater mixing is impeded by the bedrock forming a natural channel filled with sediment, allowed as to study the transformation of these parameters along hyporheic flow paths. The chemical composition of the hyporheic pore water reflected the connectivity with the surface water, as expressed in the availability of nitrate and oxygen. Conversely, microbiological parameters in all hyporheic locations were different from the surface waters, suggesting that the microbial activity in the water changes rapidly once the water enters the hyporheic zone. This feature was principally manifested in higher live-dead ratios and lower leucine aminopeptidase (an activity related to nitrogen acquisition) in the hyporheic pore waters. Overall, bacterial cell concentration and extracellular enzyme activities increased along hyporheic flow paths, with a congruent decrease in inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic matter quantity and apparent molecular size. Our findings show two important functions of the hyporheic zone during drought: (1) deeper (-50 cm) water-saturated layers can act as a refuge for microbial activity; and (2) the hyporheic zone shows high rates of carbon and nitrogen turnover when water residence times are longer during drought. These rates might be even enhanced by an increase in living microbes in the remaining moist locations of the hyporheic zone.Show less"
22,"Bianchin, M",Jul 10 2010 ,Quantifying hyporheic exchange in a tidal river using temperature time series,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"An investigation into groundwater-surface water interaction (GSWI) beneath a large tidally influenced river was conducted to determine the effect of tides on the development of a hyporheic zone (HZ) and to quantify mixing of river water and groundwater. Temperature measurements, coupled with independent hydraulic head measurements, were used to detect groundwater flow within the riverbed. GWSI under tidal forcing produced a 1 m deep HZ. Time-averaged riverbed temperature profiles displayed a distinct compressed convex pattern: clear evidence of net groundwater discharge. However, the instantaneous time series data indicate that riverbed temperatures were affected by tidal forcing to a depth of 1 m. Heat transport modeling revealed that instantaneous velocities within the shallow sediments of the riverbed are rather high, creating a zone of vigorous exchange during either a flooding or ebbing tide. Furthermore, the magnitude of the tidal pressure gradient was found to be significantly greater than the pressure gradient expected across 0.8 m high dunes, evidence that bed-form-driven exchange under these conditions, and this scale of observation, did not contribute to the development of the HZ. Conditions for exchange induced by shear and current bed form are favorable during ebbing tidal conditions only; flow paths are therefore limited in depth. Exchange flow paths in an estuary setting are complex; they are limited in duration and space and dominated by tidal pumping.Show less"

Detailed analyses of water isotopes, major and trace elements, and in situ water quality data for an individual flood event reveal that baseflow contributions rise by 8% only 320 m downstream of the point where this particular channel changes from cement-lined to unlined. However, additional hydrograph separations indicate baseflow contributions are variable and can be much higher (average baseflow increase is 16%). Stream electrical conductivity (EC) and solute concentrations in the lined reach were up to 25% lower during peak flow than in the unlined channel, indicating a greater event flow fraction. In contrast, during low flow, stream EC and solute concentrations in the lined reach were up to 30% higher due to the restricted inflow of more dilute groundwater. Over longer timescales, EC, solute concentrations, turbidity, and bacterial loads decrease downstream signifying increasing contributions of dilute baseflow. The decreased connectivity of surface waters and groundwaters along the hyporheic zone in lined channels increases the hydrologic and geochemical variability of urban streams.Show less"
24,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",Oct 15 2022 ,Drivers of functional diversity in the hyporheic zone of a large river,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The effects of regional (hydrogeology and geomorphology) and local (sediment and hydrology) characteristics on hyporheic assemblages were studied along a 40-km reach of a large gravel-bed river. Hyporheic water and fauna were sampled at the upstream and downstream positions of 15 large gravel bars. The resulting 30 stations varied in their sediment grain size, stability and direction of river-aquifer exchanges. The study concludes that at the 40-km (sector) scale, the longitudinal distribution of hyporheic fauna was controlled by 1) the hydrogeology of the valley (i.e. gaining vs loosing sectors) that modifies abundance and taxonomic richness of stygobites 2) current channel morphometry of the river (i.e. shape and location of meanders), and 3) historical changes (i.e. river incision) which modify abundance and richness of assemblages. At the local scale, we found that surface grain size and stability of the sediment evaluated by visual observation were poor predictors of hyporheos composition. In contrast, the local hydrology (i.e. downwellings, upwellings, low vertical exchanges) explained a large part of the abundance, taxonomic richness and composition of the hyporheic assemblages. Stations with low vertical exchanges were found poorly colonized, while the upwelling zones were rich in stygobites and downwelling areas harbor abundant and species-rich temporary hyporheos. It was also observed that functional diversity was controlled by the same parameters, with high relative abundances of stygobites in upwelling zones and POM feeders in downwelling zones. The heterogeneity of hydrological patterns, with alternation of upwellings and downwellings may represent the optimal spatial structure for hyporheic biodiversity conservation and resilience in rivers.Show less"
25,"Munz, M",Nov 15 2011 ,Reducing monitoring gaps at the aquifer-river interface by modelling groundwater-surface water exchange flow patterns,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This study investigates spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of aquifer-river exchange flow at a reach of the River Leith, UK. Observations of sub-channel vertical hydraulic gradients at the field site indicate the dominance of groundwater up-welling into the river and the absence of groundwater recharge from surface water. However, observed hydraulic heads do not provide information on potential surface water infiltration into the top 0-15 cm of the streambed as these depths are not covered by the existing experimental infrastructure. In order to evaluate whether surface water infiltration is likely to occur outside the 'window of detection', i.e. the shallow streambed, a numerical groundwater model is used to simulate hydrological exchanges between the aquifer and the river. Transient simulations of the successfully validated model (Nash and Sutcliff efficiency of 0.91) suggest that surface water infiltration is marginal and that the possibility of significant volumes of surface water infiltrating into non-monitored shallow streambed sediments can be excluded for the simulation period. Furthermore, the simulation results show that with increasing head differences between river and aquifer towards the end of the simulation period, the impact of streambed topography and hydraulic conductivity on spatial patterns of exchange flow rates decreases. A set of peak flow scenarios with altered groundwater-surface water head gradients is simulated in order to quantify the potential for surface water infiltration during characteristic winter flow conditions following the observation period. The results indicate that, particularly at the beginning of peak flow conditions, head gradients are likely to cause substantial increase in surface water infiltration into the streambed. The study highlights the potential for the improvement of process understanding of hyporheic exchange flow patterns at the stream reach scale by simulating aquifer-river exchange fluxes with a standard numerical groundwater model and a simple but robust model structure and parameterization.

26,"Azinheira, DL",Jul 2014 ,Comparison of effects of inset floodplains and hyporheic exchange induced by in-stream structures on solute retention,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The pollution of streams and rivers is a growing concern, and environmental guidance increasingly suggests stream restoration to improve water quality. Solute retention in off-channel storage zones, such as hyporheic zones and floodplains, is typically necessary for significant reaction to occur. Yet, the effects of two common restoration techniques, in-stream structures and inset floodplains, on solute retention have not been rigorously compared. We used MIKE SHE to model hydraulics and solute transport in the channel, on inset floodplains, and in structure-induced hyporheic zones of a third-order stream. We varied hydraulic conditions (winter base flow, summer base flow, and stormflow), geology (hydraulic conductivity), and stream restoration design parameters (inset floodplain length and presence of in-stream structures). The in-stream structures induced hyporheic exchange for approximately 20% of the year (during summer base flow) while inset floodplains were active for approximately 1% of the year (during stormflow). Flow onto inset floodplains and residence times in both the channel and on the floodplains increased nonlinearly with the fraction of bank with floodplains installed. The fraction of streamflow that flowed onto the inset floodplains was 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than that which flowed through the structure-induced hyporheic zone. Yet, residence times and mass storage in the hyporheic zone were 1-5 orders of magnitude larger than that on individual inset floodplains. In our modeling, neither in-stream structures nor inset floodplains had sufficient percent flow and residence times simultaneously to have a substantial impact on dissolved contaminants flowing downstream.Show less"
27,"Liu, SN",Nov 30 2019 ,Numerical modelling to evaluate the nitrogen removal rate in hyporheic zone and its implications for stream management,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays a vital role in the stream ecosystem. Reactions in the HZ such as denitrification and nitrification have been examined in previous studies. However, no numerical model has yet been developed that can accurately simulate nitrogen concentration changes in the HZ, because the zones for the two reactions can change throughout the reactions. This study proposes a method of evaluating the nitrogen removal rate in the HZ through numerical modelling. First, a basic two-dimensional numerical model coupling flow conditions with biochemical reactions is proposed to consider both nitrification and denitrification. The zones for different reactions are determined under the assumption that related environmental variables (i.e., the dissolved oxygen) will not change throughout the reactions. Next, to examine changes in environmental variables throughout the reactions, an improved model is proposed, and a method is developed for delineating the boundary between nitrification and denitrification zones and identifying a transition zone where either reaction might take place. However, more information about biochemical reactions in the HZ is required to use the improved model. To overcome this shortcoming, a new model that couples the basic model and genetic programming (GP) is proposed to optimize the simulation results of the basic model and allow for real-time forecasting. The results show that the basic model obtains acceptable simulation results for nitrate concentration distribution in the HZ. The improved model performs better than the basic model, but the model coupling the basic model with GP performs best. In addition, the function of the HZ in nitrogen removal is examined through a case study of four scenarios, leading to the conclusion that the HZ has a higher nitrogen removal rate when water quality is neither too poor nor too good. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the HZ and can benefit the restoration and management of HZs and streams in the face of the continual degradation caused by human activity.Show less"
28,"Frei, S",Jan 2019 ,Analytical modeling of hyporheic flow for in-stream bedforms: Perturbation method and implementation,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"Hyporheic flow and nutrient turnover in hyporheic systems are strongly influenced by in-stream bedforms. An accurate representation of topographical variations of the stream-streambed interface is therefore essential in analytical models in order to represent the couplings between hydrological and biogeochemical processes correctly. The classical Toth approach replaces the streambed surface topography by a flat surface which is identical to a truncation of the original physical flow domain into a rectangle. This simplification can lead to biased estimates of hyporheic flow and nutrient cycling within hyporheic systems. We present an alternative analytical modeling approach for solving hyporheic problems without domain truncation that explicitly accounts for topographical variations of the streambed. The presented approach is based on the application of perturbation theory. Applications of the method to hyporheic systems, ranging from the centimeter-scale of rippled bedforms to riffle structures of 10 m and larger scale, indicate a high accuracy of the approach.Show less"
29,"Marzadri, A",Dec 12 2013 ,Quantifying the importance of daily stream water temperature fluctuations on the hyporheic thermal regime: Implication for dissolved oxygen dynamics,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Water temperature is a primary driver of aquatic organism migration, drift, growth and metabolism in both stream and hyporheic zone. Here, we focus on the role of the naturally occurring daily stream water temperature oscillations on the hyporheic thermal regime and on dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics within the hyporheic zone. We choose DO as target dissolved element because of its importance for aquatic habitat quality and its role in controlling biogeochemical reactions and pool-riffle morphology as bed form because of its ubiquity and ecological relevance. To address the first objective, we introduce a new thermal Damkohler number, Da(T), which is the ratio between the median residence time of stream water and the time scale of daily amplitude attenuation of water temperature within the hyporheic zone. Application of the model to a wide range of pool-riffle dimensions shows the dependence of hyporheic water temperature distribution on hyporheic residence time. The latter is a function of the interaction between stream flow and bed form morphology. Our results show that Da(T) increases with stream size indicating that large streams have more thermally stable hyporheic zones than small streams. To address the second objective, we analytically solve the heat and dissolved oxygen transport equations through the stream-bed sediment with isotropic and homogeneous hydraulic properties by means of a Lagrangian approach, under the hypothesis that transverse dispersion can be neglected and the DO reaction rate is temperature dependant. We apply these coupled transport models to characterize the distribution of DO concentrations within the hyporheic zone. This analysis shows a relation between the patterns of water temperature and of DO concentrations with important feedbacks on the life and metabolism of aquatic organisms; as well as on the reaction rates, which control the biogeochemical processes within the streambed sediment. We analyze the effects of temperature variations on the kinetics of DO assuming constant and periodic fluctuations of DO concentrations in the stream water. Our results show that for streams with pool and riffle morphology, the latter effect is more important than that of temperature dependent reaction rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

30,"Zanatta, RC",Jun 30 2013 ,"The influence of hyporheic exchange on reach-scale water budgets in a Precambrian Shield catchment, Quebec, Canada",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The influence of hyporheic exchange on water and solute budgets of streams is widely identified as important; yet, there is a notable absence of research identifying its role in Precambrian Shield headwater streams. This research addressed this shortcoming by quantifying the proportions of solute mass loss, net and gross water gains and losses for selected reaches over a single summer recession period. Six conservative tracer injections were performed on nine reaches of a 2.94-km2 catchment in Gatineau Park, Quebec, Canada, from July to November, 2011. High solute exchange occurred for all reaches despite most showing positive net discharge. Solute losses in stream reaches typically exceeded 10%, and substantial gross water losses and gains indicate a high degree of bi-directional water exchange along stream reaches. Both solute loss and the fraction of channel water involved in hyporheic exchange increased throughout the summer in response to a decrease in discharge and increase in the time of contact. Results support the assertion that reductions in groundwater contributions to streamflow throughout the summer baseflow period allow for greater exchange of water through hyporheic flowpaths, which constitute the majority of gross channel losses and gains. Spatial (inter-reach) variability in mass loss has been previously ascribed to watershed control on exchange potential. In this catchment, net discharge and gross hydrologic gains were inversely related to the average flowpath gradients within the valley bottom and local hillslope contributing areas.

31,"Battin, TJ",Jun 2003 ,A mixing model analysis of stream solute dynamics and the contribution of a hyporheic zone to ecosystem function,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. We monitored streamwater and streambed sediment porewaters from White Clay Creek (WCC), SE Pennsylvania, for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and conductivity to investigate organic matter processing within the hyporheic zone. Dissolved organic carbon and DO concentrations were higher in the streamwater than in the porewaters and, in many cases, concentrations continued to diminish with increasing depth into the streambed.2. Hydrological exchange data demonstrated that the permeability of the stream bed declines with depth and constrains downwelling, effectively isolating porewaters >30 cm from streamwater.3. End-member mixing analysis (EMMA) based on conductivity documented a DOC source and DO sink in the hyporheic zone. We calculated hyporheic streambed DOC fluxes and respiration from the EMMA results and estimates of water flux. Based upon our calculations of biodegradable DOC entering the hyporheic zone, we estimate that DOC supports 39% of the hyporheic zone respiration, with the remaining 61% presumably being supported by entrained particulate organic carbon. Hyporheic respiration averaged 0.38 g C m(-2) d(-1) , accounted for 41% of whole ecosystem respiration, and increased baseflow ecosystem efficiency from 46 to 59%.4. Advective transport of labile organic molecules into the streambed concentrates microbial activity in near-surface regions of the hyporheic zone. Steep gradients in biogeochemical activity could explain how a shallow and hydrologically constrained hyporheic zone can dramatically influence organic matter processing at the ecosystem scale.Show less"
32,"Sheibley, RW",Sep 2003 ,"Numerical modeling of coupled nitrification-denitrification in sediment perfusion cores from the hyporheic zone of the Shingobee River, MN",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Nitrification and denitrification kinetics in sediment perfusion cores were numerically modeled and compared to experiments on cores from the Shingobee River MN, USA. The experimental design incorporated mixing groundwater discharge with stream water penetration into the cores, which provided a well-defined, one-dimensional simulation of in situ hydrologic conditions. Ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) concentration gradients suggested the upper region of the cores supported coupled nitrification dentrification, where groundwater-derived NH4+ was first oxidised to NO3- then subsequently reduced via denitrification to N-2. Nitrification and denitrification were modeled using a Crank-Nicolson finite difference approximation to a one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation. Both processes were modeled using first-order reaction kinetics because substrate concentrations (NH4+ and NO3) were much smaller than published Michaelis constants. Rate coefficients for nitrification and denitrification ranged from 0.2 to 15.8 h(-1) and 0.02 to 8.0 h(-1), respectively. The rate constants followed an Arrhenius relationship between 7.5 and 22 degreesC. Activation energies for nitrification and denitrification were 162 and 97.3 kJ/mol, respectively. Seasonal NH4+ concentration patterns in the Shingobee River were accurately simulated from the relationship between perfusion core temperature and NH4+ flux to the overlying water. The simulations suggest that NH4+ in groundwater discharge is controlled by sediment nitrification that, consistent with its activation energy, is strongly temperature dependent.

33,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",2011 ,The hyporheic refuge hypothesis reconsidered: a review of hydrological aspects,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is thought to serve multiple functions for lotic invertebrates, but its role in the persistence of benthic assemblages after disturbances ('hyporheic refuge hypothesis', HRH) has never been clearly demonstrated since its initial proposal in 1953. Water exchanges through the HZ appear to be crucial in determining most hyporheic processes and subsequently, in controlling directly or indirectly the distribution of hyporheic assemblages. At present, it seems that the distribution of hyporheic refugia would also be controlled by hyporheic flowpaths, explaining the non-uniform response to the HRH documented in the literature. In light of recent developments in hyporheic hydrology, it is timely to propose research directions for understanding the distribution and patchiness of hyporheic refugia. This review proposes a framework of hypotheses, based on the recognition of hyporheic flowpaths across several scales and predicting the highest refugial capacity in large-scale upwelling zones. Outcomes from this framework include the development of physical indicators measuring the ability of the HZ to protect invertebrates, the identification of river areas demonstrating the highest refuge capacity (hyporheic hotspots) and the promotion in restoration projects of suitable hydrologic exchanges for enhancing the development of hyporheic hotspots.Show less"
34,"Tonina, D",Oct 2016 ,Does streambed heterogeneity matter for hyporheic residence time distribution in sand-bedded streams?,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Stream water residence times within streambed sediments are key values to quantify hyporheic processes including sediment thermal regime, solute transient storage, dilution rates and biogeochemical transformations, such as those controlling degassing nitrous oxide. Heterogeneity of the streambed sediment hydraulic properties has been shown to be potentially an important factor to characterize hyporheic processes. Here, we quantify the importance of streambed heterogeneity on residence times of dune-like bedform induced hyporheic fluxes at the bedform and reach scales. We show that heterogeneity has a net effect of compression of the hyporheic zone (HZ) toward the streambed, changing HZ volume from the homogenous case and thus inducing remarkable differences in the flow field with respect to the homogeneous case. We unravel the physical conditions for which the commonly used homogenous field assumption is applicable for quantifying hyporheic processes thus explaining why predictive measures based on a characteristic residence time, like the Damkohler number, are robust in heterogeneous sand bedded streams.

We determined ecosystem respiration hyporheic community respiration, and respiration of the epilithic community at the sediment surface in the Necker, a gravel-bed river, during August 1994. Ecosystem respiration, assessed using single-station diel oxygen curves, varied between 4.6 and 7.0 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1). To estimate the respiration of the epilithic community, stones were collected from the surface layer and enclosed in flow-through respiration chambers. The respiration of the epilithic community (mainly algae) ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1), contributing 4-19% of the river ecosystem respiration. Two different methods were used for measuring hyporheic community respiration First, chambers were incubated at 30 cm sediment depth for direct assessment of respiration rates. Respiration rates of the hyporheic sediment were measured using a closed chamber system and extrapolated for comparison over 0.5 m and 1 m sediment depth. Second, the difference between whole-ecosystem respiration and respiration of the epilithic community was used for calculating the hyporheic contribution.

36,"Gooseff, MN",Jan 15 2017 ,Hydrologic connectivity and implications for ecosystem processes - Lessons from naked watersheds,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Hydrologic connectivity has received great attention recently as our conceptual models of watersheds and water quality have evolved in the past several decades. However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

37,"Fischer, H",Nov 2005 ,A river's liver - microbial processes within the hyporheic zone of a large lowland river,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Little is known on microbial activities in the sediments of large lowland rivers despite of their potentially high influence on biogeochemical budgets. Based on field measurements in a variety of sedimentary habitats typical for a large lowland river (Elbe, Germany), we present results on the abundance and production of sedimentary bacteria, the potential activity of a set of extracellular enzymes, and potential nitrification and denitrification rates. A diving bell was used to access the sediments in the central river channel, enabling us to sample down to 1 m sediment depth. Depth gradients of all measures of microbial activity were controlled by sediment structure, hydraulic conditions, as well as by the supply with organic carbon and nitrogen. Microbial heterotrophic activity was tightly coupled with the availability of carbon and nitrogen, whereas chemolithotrophic activity (nitrification rate) was related to the available surface area of particles. In the central bed of the river, bacterial production and extracellular enzyme activity remained high down to the deepest sediment layers investigated. Due to the large inner surface area and their connectivity with the surface water, the shifting sediments in the central channel of the river were microbially highly active There, vertically integrated bacterial production amounted to 0.95 g C m(-3) h(-1), which was 2.9 to 5.5 times higher than in the nearshore habitats. We conclude that carbon and nitrogen cycling in the river is controlled by the live sediments of the central river channel, which thus represent a ""liver function"" in the river's metabolism.Show less"
38,"Lee, A",Mar 2021 ,Hyporheic Exchange in Sand Dunes Under a Freely Deforming River Water Surface,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bedform-driven hyporheic exchange is conditioned by the head gradients at the sediment water interface. Local exchange phenomena between the surface and the subsurface are often driven by the dynamic forces related to the velocity distributions around sediment waves. In open channels, the static forces are represented by the water depth, yet most computational fluid dynamics models use a rigid-lid approximation. We investigated whether and when the deformation of the river's free-surface influences bedform-driven hyporheic exchange. This was done through simulations of coupled open channel and hyporheic flows with the air-water interface modeled either as a free-surface or a rigid-lid across increasing subcritical Froude numbers from similar to 0.05 to similar to 0.95. The normalized hyporheic flux was higher when considering free-surface deformation across most of the range of Froude numbers considered. When the Froude number was larger than 0.6 and smaller than 0.85, both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic-driven fluxes increased significantly compared to the rigid-lid approach and the total flux was about five times that predicted with the rigid-lid. These results indicate that bedform-driven hyporheic fluxes are underestimated in most studies that use a rigid-lid assumption in subcritical flows.Show less"

Measurements were made of vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG), total dissolved phosphor-us (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) in water and of three extractable forms of phosphorus (water extractable, NaOH extractable and H2SO4 extractable) in hyporheic sediments from the gravel bars. Dissolved phosphorus was the major contributor to TP (74-79%) in both interstitial and surface waters on all sampling dates, and in most cases surface water P concentrations were significantly higher than interstitial concentrations. Hyporheic sediment TP concentrations ranged between 269 and 465 mu g g(-1) and were highest in fine sediment fractions. Acid-extractable P, a non-bioavailable form, represented at least 95% of sediment TP. A positive relationship was observed between VHG and TP in two of the gravel bars, with wells that were strongly downwelling having lower TP concentrations. These results suggest that in downwelling zones, hyporheic sediments can trap surface-derived dissolved P, and that much of this P becomes stored in refractory particulate forms. Bioavailable P is mainly present in dissolved form and only occupies a small fraction of total P, with particulate P comprising the majority of total P.

40,"Packman, AI",Apr 18 2003 ,"Interplay of stream-subsurface exchange, clay particle deposition, and streambed evolution",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Hyporheic exchange ( mixing of stream water with pore water beneath the stream) is responsible for the transport of many ecologically relevant substances across the stream-subsurface interface. This process is dependent on both the streamflow conditions and sedimentary properties, but the complex nature of fluvial systems has presented a barrier to the development of mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of stream-subsurface interactions. This work presents the results of a controlled study to examine in detail the relationship between stream-subsurface exchange fluxes, delivery of suspended sediments to the hyporheic region, fine particle accumulation in the streambed, and alteration of sedimentary properties. Laboratory flume experiments were used to observe kaolinite clay deposition in a sand bed and the resulting alteration of hyporheic exchange fluxes. Solute and suspended sediment exchange with clean sand beds is predicted well by a fundamental model for bed form-driven advective pumping exchange. However, substantial accumulation of clay in the bed causes an alteration of the pore water flow environment, which reduces both water flux across the stream-subsurface interface and subsequent particle deposition. Measurement of bulk solute exchange and direct observation of clay accumulation in the bed both indicate that transported fine particles are preferentially removed near the stream-subsurface interface. Clogging of inflow regions produces heterogeneous subsurface clay deposits even when the bed is initially homogeneous. This behavior is also predicted by the fundamental colloid pumping model. These results contradict the accepted view that suspended sediments will generally deposit in the deepest regions of the bed and thus clog the bed from the bottom upward. Our results indicate that clogging of the streambed surface will often isolate deeper regions of the bed from the streamflow, so that even relatively low amounts of suspended sediments can substantially degrade streambed habitat.Show less"
41,"Clinton, SM",Aug 2010 ,Exoenzyme activities as indicators of dissolved organic matter composition in the hyporheic zone of a floodplain river,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"P>1. We measured the hyporheic microbial exoenzyme activities in a floodplain river to determine whether dissolved organic matter (DOM) bioavailability varied with overlying riparian vegetation patch structure or position along flowpaths.2. Particulate organic matter (POM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity and temperature were sampled from wells in a riparian terrace on the Queets River, Washington, U.S.A. on 25 March, 15 May, 20 July and 09 October 1999. Dissolved nitrate, ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus were also collected on 20 July and 09 October 1999. Wells were characterised by their associated overlying vegetation: bare cobble/young alder, mid-aged alder (8-20 years) and old alder/old-growth conifer (25 to > 100 years). POM was analysed for the ash-free dry mass and the activities of eight exoenzymes (alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, beta -N-acetylglucosaminidase, xylosidase, phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, esterase and endopeptidase) using fluorogenic substrates.3. Exoenzyme activities in the Queets River hyporheic zone indicated the presence of an active microbial community metabolising a diverse array of organic molecules. Individual exoenzyme activity (mean +/- standard error) ranged from 0.507 +/- 0.1547 to 22.8 +/- 5.69 mu mol MUF (g AFDM)-1 h-1, was highly variable among wells and varied seasonally, with the lowest rates occurring in March. Exoenzyme activities were weakly correlated with DO, DOC and inorganic nutrient concentrations.4. Ratios of leucine aminopeptidase : beta-glucosidase were low in March, May and October and high in July, potentially indicating a switch from polysaccharides to proteins as the dominant component of microbial metabolism.5. Principal components analysis indicated that there were patch effects and that these effects were strongest in the summer.6. DOM degradation patterns did not change systematically along hyporheic flowpaths but varied with overlying forest patch type in the Queets River hyporheic zone, suggesting that additional carbon inputs exist. We hypothesise that the most likely input is the downward movement of DOM from overlying riparian soils. Understanding this movement of DOM from soils to subsurface water is essential for understanding both the hyporheic metabolism and the carbon budget of streams and rivers.Show less"
42,"Datry, T",Aug 2007 ,Responses of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages to large-scale variation in flow permanence and surface-subsurface exchange,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Flow permanence (the proportion of time that flowing water is present) strongly influences benthic invertebrate assemblages in ephemeral and intermittent river reaches. Effects of varying flow permanence on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages are not well understood, and have not previously been studied at large spatial scales.2. We used a 52-km long flow-permanence gradient in the alluvial Selwyn River, New Zealand to assess hyporheic assemblage responses to variation in flow permanence and surface-subsurface exchange. The Selwyn mainstem consists of perennial and temporary reaches embedded in longer downwelling (losing) and upwelling (gaining) sections.3. We predicted that hyporheic invertebrate diversity, density and assemblage stability would increase with increasing flow permanence. We further predicted that assemblage structure would be influenced by the relative contribution of downwelling and upwelling water at the reach-scale.4. Hyporheic invertebrates were collected at 15 river cross-sections over a 13-month period. As predicted, hyporheic taxon richness, density and assemblage stability varied directly with flow permanence. The distribution of taxa along the flow permanence gradient appeared to be related to desiccation resistance. However, it is possible that proximity to colonist sources also contributed to distribution patterns.5. Taxon richness was significantly higher at sites in the gaining section compared with the losing section. Sites with high flow permanence in the gaining and losing sections supported distinct hyporheic assemblages, characterised by amphipods and isopods in the gaining section, and ostracods, Hydra sp. and the mayfly Deleatidium spp. in the losing section.6. Results of the study suggest an expansion of the scope of the Hyporheic Corridor Concept to include large hyporheic flowpaths associated with unbounded alluvial plains rivers. Hyporheic assemblages in alluvial rivers are strongly influenced by large-scale flow permanence gradients, large-scale surface water-groundwater exchange, and their interactions.Show less"
43,"Takahashi, G",May 15 2008 ,Hyporheic flow as a potential geomorphic agent in the evolution of channel morphology in a gravel-bed river,CATENA,"Morphologic and hydrologic properties of head-cut gullies formed in meandering bends of a gravel-bed river in northern Japan were examined to investigate their topographic development. head-cut gullies had incised to 2 in below the floodplain surface and had perennial seepage outflows. Because no surface runoff was observed across the meandering necks, we hypothesized that hyporheic flow erosion cutting into the down-river edge of the meandering necks is one factor for the development of head-cut gullies. Several topographic features caused by sapping and piping erosion were observed within the head-cut gullies. A tracer experiment and examination of the water table, water chemistry, and water table responses in wells on the floodplain and within the head-cut gully revealed that significant preferential hyporheic flow occurred between coarse cobble and fine sediment layers of the floodplain materials. During a storm event, water tables around the head-cut gully quickly responded to changes in the water table of the stream channel; this result also suggests that hyporheic flow occurred across the meandering bends. Hyporheic flow around the head-cut gullies had higher hydraulic conductivities and preferential flow paths that may relate to buried beds of paleochannels. An erosion model suggests that it is unlikely that hyporheic flow alone had enough energy to account for all the soil erosion. Thus, a combination of hyporheic flow (sapping erosion) and channel erosion (bank erosion) appeared to contribute to the formation of the head-cut gullies. Hyporheic flow is an important component in the geomorphic evolution of channels and the floodplain in a gravel-bed river. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
44,"VALETT, HM",Mar 1994 ,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE AND ECOLOGICAL STABILITY OF A DESERT STREAM ECOSYSTEM,ECOLOGY,The influence of hydrologic linkage between hyporheic and surface subsystems was investigated in sand-bottomed reaches of a desert stream. Direction of hydrologic exchange was measured as vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) using mini-piezometers. Maps of VHG indicated upwelling (discharge from the interstitial regions into surface water) at the bases of riffles and heads of runs; downwelling (infiltration of surface water into the hyporheic zone) occurred at the bases of runs. Dissolved NO3-N in surface water was higher over or immediately downstream from upwelling zones. Loss of continued supply from the hyporheic zone and intense assimilatory demand by surface autotrophs generated longitudinal declines in NO3-N and lower nutrient concentrations in downwelling zones. Algal standing crop (as chlorophyll a) was significantly higher in upwelling zones than in areas without positive VHG. Postflood trajectories of chlorophyll a indicated that algae at upwelling zones recovered from disturbance significantly faster than those at downwelling zones. Recovery rate was related to supply of NO3-N from enriched interstitial water in the hyporheic zone. Hydrologic linkage integrates surface and hyporheic subsystems and increases ecosystem stability by enhancing resilience of primary producers following flash flood disturbance.Show less
45,"Cuthbert, MO",Nov 2010 ,Impacts of river bed gas on the hydraulic and thermal dynamics of the hyporheic zone,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Despite the presence of gas in river beds being a well known phenomenon, its potential feedbacks on the hydraulic and thermal dynamics of the hyporheic zone has not been widely studied. This paper explores hypotheses that the presence of accumulated gas impacts the hydraulic and thermal dynamics of a river bed due to changes in specific storage, hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, and thermal diffusivity. The hypotheses are tested using data analysis and modelling for a study site on the urban River Tame, Birmingham, UK. Gas, predominantly attributed to microbial denitrification, was observed in the river bed up to around 14% by volume, and to at least 0.8 m depth below river bed. Numerical modelling indicates that, by altering the relative hydraulic conductivity distribution, the gas in the river bed leads to an increase of groundwater discharge from the river banks (relative to river bed) by a factor of approximately 2 during river low flow periods. The increased compressible storage of the gas phase in the river bed leads to an increase in the simulated volume of river water invading the river bed within the centre of the channel during storm events. The exchange volume can be more than 30% greater in comparison to that for water saturated conditions. Furthermore, the presence of gas also reduces the water-filled porosity, and so the possible depth of such invading flows may also increase markedly, by more than a factor of 2 in the observed case. Observed diurnal temperature variations within the gaseous river bed at 0.1 and 0.5 m depth are, respectively, around 1.5 and 6 times larger than those predicted for saturated sediments. Annual temperature fluctuations are seen to be enhanced by around 4 to 20% compared to literature values for saturated sediments. The presence of gas may thus alter the bulk thermal properties to such a degree that the use of heat tracer techniques becomes subject to a much greater degree of uncertainty. Although the likely magnitude of thermal and hydraulic changes due to the presence of gas for this site have been demonstrated, further research is needed into the origins of the gas and its spatial and temporal variability to enable quantification of the significance of these changes for chemical attenuation and hyporheic zone biology.

46,"Gomez-Velez, JD",Oct 2017 ,Flow and Residence Times of Dynamic River Bank Storage and Sinuosity-Driven Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) vary significantly along river corridors due to spatiotemporal changes in discharge and geomorphology. This variability results in the emergence of biogeochemical hot-spots and hot-moments that ultimately control solute and energy transport and ecosystem services from the local to the watershed scales. In this work, we use a reduced-order model to gain mechanistic understanding of river bank storage and sinuosity-driven hyporheic exchange induced by transient river discharge. This is the first time that a systematic analysis of both processes is presented and serves as an initial step to propose parsimonious, physics-based models for better predictions of water quality at the large watershed scale. The effects of channel sinuosity, alluvial valley slope, hydraulic conductivity, and river stage forcing intensity and duration are encapsulated in dimensionless variables that can be easily estimated or constrained. We find that the importance of perturbations in the hyporheic zone's flux, residence times, and geometry is mainly explained by two-dimensionless variables representing the ratio of the hydraulic time constant of the aquifer and the duration of the event (Gamma(d)) and the importance of the ambient groundwater flow (Delta h*). Our model additionally shows that even systems with small sensitivity, resulting in small changes in the hyporheic zone extent, are characterized by highly variable exchange fluxes and residence times. These findings highlight the importance of including dynamic changes in hyporheic zones for typical HEF models such as the transient storage model.Show less"
47,"Lencioni, V",Jun 2015 ,Diversity and distribution of benthic and hyporheic fauna in different stream types on an alpine glacial floodplain,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Although processes involved in the relationship between hyporheic and benthic zone have been elucidated in recent years, the spatial and temporal dynamics of the invertebrate assemblages is unclear in alpine streams. A field study was carried out in a glacier-fed stream and in its main spring-fed tributary, in the Italian Alps. Benthic hyporheic connectivity was investigated by means of a pond net, a pump, and artificial substrates. The main determinant in structuring the community was the habitat (=benthic, hyporheic), accounting for 22% of the total faunal variation. A strong similarity was detected between the two streams in structure, function, and species seasonal variations of the hyporheos, that was, in both, more species rich than the benthos. In contrast, benthos was generally very different between the two streams, with a more pronounced turnover in the glacier-fed than in the spring-fed stream. Overall, the highly disturbed glacial system hosted a simplified benthos and hyporheos compared to the stable spring system, in agreement with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Our findings provided also evidences about the trophic-sink effect between benthos and hyporheos. Spatial connectivity that we highlighted might have a key role in the dispersal of invertebrates facing changes in habitats features due to climate change.Show less"
48,"Mendoza-Lera, C",Oct 2019 ,Exploring the role of hydraulic conductivity on the contribution of the hyporheic zone to in-stream nitrogen uptake,ECOHYDROLOGY,"Nitrogen uptake (N-uptake) within the hyporheic zone provides key ecological services, such as nutrient removal, of stream ecosystems. We hypothesize that the hydraulic conductivity (Kf) of the hyporheic sediments governs nutrient uptake rates through effects on the (a) surface and subsurface flow (i.e., hyporheic flow) and (b) hyporheic N-uptake. Here, we worked at two hierarchical spatial scales (reach and hyporheic scale) to disentangle the role of Kf on N-uptake. At the reach scale, we performed coinjected N-NH4+ and Cl- additions in six reaches with contrasting reach Kf (10(-1)-10(-5) m/s) and simultaneously determined (a) in-stream N-uptake (hyporheic+benthic N-uptake) and (b) hyporheic flow, and (c) N-uptake and microbial community abundance at the hyporheic scale. Results suggest that Kf determines the contribution of the hyporheic zone to hydrological exchange but that its role varies between scales to determine in-stream N-uptake. At the reach scale, Kf variability seems to determine the extent at which the hyporheic zone contributes to hyporheic flow and, thus, to N-uptake velocity. At the hyporheic scale, Kf seems to indirectly determine hyporheic N-uptake through the proportion of surface water that enters the hyporheic zone (i.e., relative connectivity) and the abundance of the microbial community. These results suggest an interplay between Kf at both scales and its spatial heterogeneity, which will ultimately drive in-stream N-uptake at reach scale. In this sense, we found that Kf can be considered as a unifying variable for stream biogeochemical processes and as an important variable to derive the contribution of hyporheic zone to in-stream nutrient removal capacity.Show less"
49,"Fuller, IC",May 2018 ,The science of connected ecosystems: What is the role of catchment-scale connectivity for healthy river ecology?,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,"Riverine biological communities are highly resilient to extreme flood and/or drying disturbance regimes that would otherwise be destructive because these organisms can recolonise from upstream, floodplain, or hyporheic refugia when suitable conditions return. Healthy rivers require a high degree of connectivity to support complex life cycles of many lotic organisms and associated ecosystem functioning. Similarly, connectivity is required for appropriate geophysical functioning; permitting flux of water and sediment that drives channel-forming and ecological processes. Ecological and geophysical processes have operated in this temporal and spatial patchwork of disturbance and recovery pre-Anthropocene. Human impacts are increasing constraints on river and floodplain connectivity, severing many natural pathways, and degrading river ecosystem functioning. River restoration seeks to re-establish some of those biological and physical connections to enhance some level of system health. However, increasing sediment connectivity may be detrimental to river health in some instances. Strongly connected catchments can transmit excessive quantities of sediment from inappropriate land management, detrimental invasive species can spread more widely, and many ecosystem processes can exceed positive feedback control. Simply restoring connectivity will not necessarily lead to healthy river ecosystems. River management requires a greater understanding of how and when connectivity can and should be restored. Although current thinking is often that greater connectivity is better, we illustrate with examples from New Zealand rivers that this is not always the case. The benefits and costs of maintaining or restoring river connectivity need to be given as much attention as the restoration and maintenance of river systems per se.Show less"
