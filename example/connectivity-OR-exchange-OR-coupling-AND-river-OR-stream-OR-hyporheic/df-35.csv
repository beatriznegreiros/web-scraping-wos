0,"Wilbanks, KA",Mar 2022 ,Flooding effects on aquatic invertebrates in oxbow lakes of a southeastern USA river floodplain,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"We investigated the relative importance of connectivity to the main river channel and the influence of flooding on macroinvertebrate distributions in oxbow lakes of a southeastern USA river floodplain. Invertebrate assemblages were described in four oxbow lakes located on the Savannah River; two with continuous connection to the main stem river (i.e., high connectivity) and two that were only connected during a significant flood event (i.e., low connectivity). Invertebrate assemblages were sampled 25 times over a major flooding event (before, during and after) in 2014-2015 to determine the influence of lateral hydrological connection. Community response (pseudo-F-1,F-19 = 1.06, P < 0.01) showed differences in oxbow lakes before, during and after flooding. Assemblages did not differ between high and low connectivity lakes before or after flooding in community response or any individual metrics. However, during flooding, oxbow lakes with high connectivity differed in Tolerance and Habit metrics, and oxbows lakes with low connectivity differed in Composition, Tolerance and Functional Feeding Group metrics. Post-flood, invertebrate assemblages quickly reverted back to pre-flood conditions. Although flooding affected invertebrate assemblages, with impacts being greatest in oxbows with low connectivity, responses were short-lived and pre-flood conditions soon reestablished.Show less"
1,"Zilli, FL",Oct 2013 ,Ecological Responses to Different Degrees of Hydrologic Connectivity: Assessing Patterns in the Bionomy of Benthic Chironomids in a Large River-Floodplain System,WETLANDS,"Floodplain wetlands of the Middle Parana River, Argentina, are regulated by their hydrologic connectivity to the main channel as well as by their position within the river network. The Chironomids are the most abundant insects that inhabit the benthos of the Parana River floodplain habitats. In order to address whether wetlands with different degrees of connectivity (disconnected, temporarily, and permanently connected) exhibit different abundance patterns and secondary production of benthic chironomids, samples were collected during a year comprising high and low water phases. The disconnected wetland exhibited the highest abundance and secondary production of chironomids. Both attributes were positively correlated to the degree of connectivity for most of the predators among the connected wetlands. Differences in assemblages' composition and secondary production were found to be in relation to the degree of connectivity, the cover of macrophytes, the detritus at the bottom, the transparency of water, the proportion of clay in bottom sediments and the location of wetlands within the floodplain. The interaction between local environmental factors mediated by lateral connectivity and regional dynamics of metapopulations established diverse patterns in the metrics of chironomids along the Parana River floodplain wetlands. Thus, various degrees of hydrologic connectivity of wetlands should be preserved to maintain a high productivity of different chironomids in the floodplain.Show less"
2,"Karim, F",Mar 2015 ,Assessing the impacts of climate change and dams on floodplain inundation and wetland connectivity in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Floodplain wetlands and their hydrological connectivity with main river channels in the Australian wetdry tropics are under increasing pressure from global climate change and water resource development, and there is a need for modelling tools to estimate the time dynamics of connectivity. This paper describes an integrated modelling framework combining conceptual rainfall-runoff modelling, river system modelling and hydrodynamic (HD) modelling to estimate hydrological connectivity between wetlands and rivers in the Flinders and Gilbert river catchments in northern Australia. Three historical flood events ranging from a mean annual flood to a 35-year return period flood were investigated using a two dimensional HD model (MIKE 21). Inflows from upstream catchments were estimated using a river network model. Local runoff within the HD modelling domain was simulated using the Sacramento rainfall-runoff model. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) derived 30 m DEM was used to reproduce floodplain topography, stream networks and wetlands in the HD model. The HD model was calibrated using stream gauge data and inundation maps derived from satellite (MODIS: MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery. An algorithm was developed to combine the simulated water heights with the DEM to quantify inundation and flow connection between wetlands and rivers. The connectivity of 18 ecologically important wetlands on the Flinders floodplain and 7 on the Gilbert floodplain were quantified. The impacts of climate change and water resource development on connectivity to individual wetlands were assessed under a projected dry climate (2nd driest of 15 GCMs), wet climate (2nd wettest of 15 GCMs) and dam conditions. The results indicate that changes in rainfall under a wetter and drier future climate could have large impacts on area, duration and frequency of inundation and connectivity. Topographic relief, river bank elevation and flood magnitude were found to be the key factors contributing to the level of connectivity. Under a wetter future climate the average duration of connection of wetlands to the main river channel increased by 7% and under a drier climate it decreased by 18%. Construction of a 248 GL dam in the Flinders catchment and two (498 and 271 GL capacity) in the Gilbert catchment could reduce the average duration of connectivity by 1% and 2% in the Flinders and Gilbert catchments respectively. This information is potentially useful to future studies on the flood-dependent ecology in this region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
3,"Hu, J",Jun 2019 ,An attempt to measure longitudinal connectivity based on the community structure of phytoplankton,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"At present, there are few studies on the quantitative analysis of connectivity from the perspective of biocenology. This study aimed to develop a new quantitative assessment method for river connectivity based on the analysis of the effect of river connectivity on the phytoplankton community in the Shaying River, which has multiple gates. The results showed that from the view of the phytoplankton density and biomass, cryptophytes were the dominant phytoplankton group, but the cyanobacteria density was highest in the summer. In the top 10 of degrees of dominance, there were 4 species of cyanobacteria, 3 species of cryptophytes, 2 species of diatoms, and 1 species of chlorophytes. Based on the seasonal compositions and variations of the phytoplankton community, the river barriers had a great effect on the community. The community composition of the Shaying River has been transformed from a river-type community dominated by diatoms to a lake-type community dominated by cyanophytes. PCA (principal component analysis) indicated that there were obvious differences in the community structure among the sections partitioned by various river gates. According to the relative positions of the entire phytoplankton community and the relative sequence of the river gates, a potential gradient representing the river connectivity can be found; thus, the river connectivity can be quantitatively described from the perspective of the phytoplankton community, and hereby, the corresponding quantitative methods can be established. Characterizing the connectivity of rivers based on biota will facilitate assessing the effects of multiple barriers and understanding river connectivity, and provide the support for the effective management of rivers.Show less"
4,"Hester, ET",Nov 2014 ,Controls on mixing-dependent denitrification in hyporheic zones induced by riverbed dunes: A steady state modeling study,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone is known to attenuate contaminants originating from surface water, yet the ability of the hyporheic zone to attenuate contaminants in upwelling groundwater plumes as they exit to surface water is less understood. We used MODFLOW and SEAM3D to simulate hyporheic flow cells induced by riverbed dunes and upwelling groundwater together with mixing-dependent denitrification of an upwelling nitrate (NO3-) plume. Our base case modeled labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) advecting from surface water, and DO and NO3- advecting from groundwater, typical of certain agricultural areas. We conducted sensitivity analyses that showed mixing-dependent denitrification in the hyporheic zone increased with increasing hydraulic conductivity (K), decreasing lower boundary flux, and increasing DOC in surface water or NO3- in groundwater. Surface water DOC, groundwater NO3-, and K were the most sensitive parameters affecting mixing-dependent denitrification. Nonmixing-dependent denitrification also occurred when there was surface water NO3-, and its magnitude was often greater than mixing-dependent denitrification. Nevertheless, mixing-dependent reactions provide functions that nonmixing-dependent reactions cannot, with potential for hyporheic zones to attenuate upwelling NO3- plumes, depending on geomorphic, hydraulic, and biogeochemical conditions. Stream and river restoration efforts may be able to increase mixing-dependent reactions by promoting natural processes that promote bedform creation and augment labile carbon sources.Show less"

6,"Cheong, TS",Jul 2007 ,Estimation of key parameters in model for solute transport in rivers and streams,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"The exchange mechanisms associated with transient storage zones of a natural heterogeneous environment are often modified by unsteady water flux in the transient storage zone. This phenomenon can play an important role in the mass exchange between the free flowing water zone and the transient storage zones and may be the cause of the plateau region of the tail of observed concentration curves in natural streams. Deterministic interpretation methods are often used to generate the shape of the solute concentration curves in natural streams based on representations of transient storage exchange. Although many models are available to predict the parameters for the deterministic interpretation method, none can be used with confidence unless previously calibrated in the particular river reach under consideration. Therefore, the availability of reliable means for the provision of these parameters is usually the primary difficulty in the prediction of the rate of movement, dilution, and mixing of solute in rivers and streams. Measured tracer-response curves produced from the injection of a known quantity of soluble tracer provide one means for obtaining the requisite parameters. In this work, we advance an alternative approach based on the use of hydraulic and geometric information that are easily obtained in natural streams. Empirical equations used to predict the parameters are also analyzed to evaluate their behavior in representing solute mixing in natural streams with transient storage zones. Finally, the present proposals are validated against field meausrements of the solute concentration curves of chloride along a 1.2 km reach of the Shingobee River, Minnesota, U.S.A.Show less"

We provide the first consideration of larval connectivity among deep-sea sponge populations along the southeastern coast of North America, illustrate the influence of the Gulf Stream on dispersal, and complement published distribution models by evaluating colonization potential. Connectivity among known populations of the hexactinellid sponge Vazella pourtalesii was simulated using a 3-D biophysical dispersal model throughout its distribution from Florida, United States to Nova Scotia, Canada. We found no exchange with an estimated pelagic larval duration of 2 weeks between populations north and south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina at surface, mid-water and seabed release depths, irrespective of month of release or application of a horizontal diffusion constant specific to cross-Gulf Stream diffusivity. The population north of Cape Hatteras and south of Cape Cod was isolated. There was some evidence that Gulf Stream eddies formed near Cape Hatteras could travel to the northwest, connecting the populations in the two sub-regions, however that would require a much longer pelagic duration than what is currently known. More likely almost all larval settlement will be in the immediate area of the adults. At sub-regional scales, connectivity was found from the Strait of Florida through to the Blake Plateau, southeastern United States, with the latter area showing potential for recruitment from more than one source population. The influence of the Charleston Bump, a shallow feature rising from the Blake Plateau, was substantial. Particles seeded just north of the Bump were transported greater distances than those seeded to the south, some of which were caught in an associated gyre, promoting retention at the seabed. To the north on the Scotian Shelf, despite weaker currents and greater distances between known occurrences, unidirectional transport was detected from Emerald Basin to the Northeast Channel between Georges and Browns Banks. These major conclusions remained consistent through simulations run with different averaging periods for the currents (decades to daily) and using two ocean model products (BNAM and GLORYS12V1).Show less"
9,"Wohl, E",Jan 2014 ,"CONTROLS ON THE LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION OF CHANNEL-SPANNING LOGJAMS IN THE COLORADO FRONT RANGE, USA",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Channel-spanning logjams completely span the active channel and create longitudinal discontinuities of the water surface and stream bed across at least two-thirds of the channel width. These jams disproportionately affect channel process and form relative to smaller jams that do not span the entire channel width. We analyze a spatially extensive dataset of 859 channel-spanning jams distributed along 124km of 16 distinct rivers on the eastern side of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA, with drainage areas spanning 2.6 to 258km(2) and diverse valley geometry and forest stand age. We categorized valley geometry in terms of lateral confinement (confined, partly confined, or unconfined), which correlates with gradient. Jams exhibit substantial downstream variability in spacing at channel lengths of 10(2)-10(3)m. The number of jams within a reach is explained by a statistical model that includes drainage area, valley type (lateral confinement), and channel width. Longitudinal spacing of jams drops substantially at drainage areas greater than similar to 20km(2), although jam spacing exhibits tremendous variability at smaller drainage areas. We interpret the lack of jams at larger drainage areas to reflect increasing transport capacity for instream wood. We interpret the variability in jam spacing at small drainage areas to reflect local controls of valley geometry and associated wood recruitment and fluvial transport capacity. Our results suggest that management of instream wood designed to facilitate the formation of channel-spanning jams can be most effectively focused on smaller drainage areas where these jams are most abundant in the absence of management that alters instream wood recruitment or retention. Unmanaged streams in the study region with drainage area <60km(2) have similar to 1.1 channel-spanning jams per 100m length of stream. The cumulative effects of these jams on instream storage of sediment and organic matter, hyporheic exchange, instream habitat, stream metabolism, and channel-floodplain connectivity are likely to be enormous.

10,"Wollheim, WM",Jun 1999 ,A coupled field and modeling approach for the analysis of nitrogen cycling in streams,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The stable isotope stream tracer model (SISTM) calculates the expected N-15 content in various stream ecosystem N compartments over distance and time during and after N-15 additions to streams. SISTM is a steady state compartment model that predicts delta(15)N values based on N stocks and fluxes and the experimental rate of N-15 addition. Predicted delta(15)N values are compared with observed delta(15)N values from a field tracer addition to evaluate our understanding of the N cycle. We demonstrated the use of this tool with information collected from field measurements and a 6-wk N-15-NH4+ addition to the Kuparuk River, Alaska, during the summer of 1991. SISTM was used to run a series of model calibrations that reflected increased information as the experiment progressed. Results of an a priori calibration (using pre-1991 data) yielded a predicted NH4+ uptake length (S-w) of 5.2 km compared with the observed S-w of 0.84 km, and underestimated the delta(15)N values of biota in all cases. When discharge and NH4+ concentrations measured during the 1991 experiment were added (model calibration Update 1), the predicted S-w, dropped to 0.44 km, indicating that the modeled fluxes overestimated the rate of NH4+ removal by the stream bottom. Adding N stocks and fluxes measured during the tracer addition (Update 2) did not improve predicted S-w, indicating faulty assumptions in our a priori calibration. The observed isotope data were used to estimate the form (NH4+ vs NO3-) of N taken up by primary producers and to improve our representation of the epilithon compartment (Update 3). Including this information brought the predicted S-w to 0.71 km compared with the observed 0.84 km, and resulted in a reasonable correspondence between predicted and observed delta(15)N values over the 6-wk addition. SISTM can be used as a framework to 1) summarize N-cycle information prior to a tracer addition, 2) generate testable predictions for field isotope studies, 3) improve our understanding of the N cycle using the field isotope data as constraints on nw: estimates, and 4) explore hypothetical N-cycle characteristics. The combined modeling and field tracer experiment approach efficiently provided a synoptic view of the N cycle in streams and rivers.Show less"
11,"Beger, M",Sep 2010 ,Incorporating asymmetric connectivity into spatial decision making for conservation,CONSERVATION LETTERS,"Real patterns of ecological connectivity are seldom explicitly or systematically accounted for systematic conservation planning, in part because commonly used decision support systems can only capture simplistic notions of connectivity. Conventionally, the surrogates used to represent connectivity in conservation plans have assumed the connection between two sites to be symmetric in strength. In reality, ecological linkages between sites are rarely symmetric and often strongly asymmetric. Here, we develop a novel formulation that enabled us to incorporate asymmetric connectivity into the conservation decision support system Marxan. We illustrate this approach using hypothetical examples of a river catchment and a group of reefs, and then apply it to case studies in the Snowy River catchment and Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We show that incorporating asymmetric ecological connectivity in systematic reserve design leads to solutions that more effectively capture connectivity patterns, relative to either ignoring connectivity or assuming symmetric connectivity.Show less"
12,"Shamieh, F",Aug 2019 ,Dynamic Cross-Layer Signaling Exchange for Real-Time and On-Demand Multimedia Streams,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA,"Multimedia streams consume a significant chunk of the consumer Internet traffic exchanged and will continue to do so due to the ever-increasing connection among people, businesses, and industries. To cope with the deviation of the Internet's intended use, unreliable underlying infrastructure, and best effort protocols while leveraging existing technologies, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Adaptive Streaming is utilized by numerous multimedia services. Performance of HAS-based streaming services is limited by the growing control overhead generated by the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack as the stream length, multimedia fidelity, and network conditions vary. In this paper, a novel cross-layer steganographic-enabled signaling scheme is proposed to reduce service provider costs while improving multimedia session performance and maintaining expected Quality-of-Service (QoS). The proposed scheme is designed to encode control stream messages from any TCP/IP layer within payload messages to reduce the total amount of overhead exchanged, thereby decreasing resource utilization within source and intermediate nodes. Furthermore, the encoding scheme probes network conditions and session statistics for adaptive decision-making to enable real-time pliability of the proposed process. A utility function is developed to find the optimal cost savings where simulations are conducted to verify the designs. The proposed solution is then implemented using VideoLan Media Player transceivers residing in linux containers virtual machines, where a multimedia file is exchanged in the popular Advanced Video Coding (H. 264) format. The results show a decrease in bandwidth and average queue waiting time costs of 4.71% and 29.61%, respectively, with a throughput increase of 5.77%.Show less"
13,"Earon, R",Dec 2020 ,Insight into the influence of local streambed heterogeneity on hyporheic-zone flow characteristics,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Interaction between surface water and groundwater plays a fundamental role in influencing aquatic chemistry, where hyporheic exchange processes, distribution of flow paths and residence times within the hyporheic zone will influence the transport of mass and energy in the surface-water/groundwater system. Geomorphological conditions greatly influence hyporheic exchange, and heterogeneities such as rocks and clay lenses will be a key factor for delineating the hyporheic zone. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) were used to investigate the streambed along a 6.3-m-long reach in order to characterise geological layering and distinct features which may influence parameters such as hydraulic conductivity. Time-lapse ERT measurements taken during a tracer injection demonstrated that geological features at the meter-scale played a determining role for the hyporheic flow field. The penetration depth of the tracer into the streambed sediment displayed a variable spatial pattern in areas where the presence of highly resistive anomalies was detected. In areas with more homogeneous sediments, the penetration depth was much more uniformly distributed than observed in more heterogeneous sections, demonstrating that ERT can play a vital role in identifying critical hydraulic features that may influence hyporheic exchange processes. Reciprocal ERT measurements linked variability and thus uncertainty in the modelled resistivity to the spatial locations, which also demonstrated larger variability in the tracer penetration depth, likely due to local heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field.Show less"
14,"Martinez-Carreras, N",2015 ,Hydrological connectivity inferred from diatom transport through the riparian-stream system,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Diatoms (Bacillariophyta) are one of the most common and diverse algal groups (ca. 200 000 species, approximate to 10-200 mu m, unicellular, eukaryotic). Here we investigate the potential of aerial diatoms (i.e. diatoms nearly exclusively occurring outside water bodies, in wet, moist or temporarily dry places) to infer surface hydrological connectivity between hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) landscape units during storm runoff events. We present data from the Weier-bach catchment (0.45 km(2), northwestern Luxembourg) that quantify the relative abundance of aerial diatom species on hillslopes and in riparian zones (i.e. surface soils, litter, bryophytes and vegetation) and within streams (i.e. stream water, epilithon and epipelon). We tested the hypothesis that different diatom species assemblages inhabit specific moisture domains of the catchment (i.e. HRS units) and, consequently, the presence of certain species assemblages in the stream during runoff events offers the potential for recording whether there was hydrological connectivity between these domains or not. We found that a higher percentage of aerial diatom species was present in samples collected from the riparian and hillslope zones than inside the stream. However, diatoms were absent on hillslopes covered by dry litter and the quantities of diatoms (in absolute numbers) were small in the rest of hillslope samples. This limits their use for inferring hillslope- riparian zone connectivity. Our results also showed that aerial diatom abundance in the stream increased systematically during all sampled events (n = 11, 2011-2012) in response to incident precipitation and increasing discharge. This transport of aerial diatoms during events suggested a rapid connectivity between the soil surface and the stream. Diatom transport data were compared to two-component hydrograph separation, and end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) using stream water chemistry and stable isotope data. Hillslope overland flow was insignificant during most sampled events. This research suggests that diatoms were likely sourced exclusively from the riparian zone, since it was not only the largest aerial diatom reservoir, but also since soil water from the riparian zone was a major stream-flow source during rainfall events under both wet and dry antecedent conditions. In comparison to other tracer methods, diatoms require taxonomy knowledge and a rather large processing time. However, they can provide unequivocal evidence of hydrological connectivity and potentially be used at larger catchment scales.Show less"

However, a full bottom-up accounting of NEE (the vertical carbon flux) that is suitable for integration with atmosphere-based inversion modeling also includes emissions from decomposition/respiration of harvested forest and agricultural products, CO2 evasion from streams and rivers, and biomass burning. Here, we produce a daily time step NEE for North America for the year 2004 that includes NEP as well as the additional emissions. This NEE product was run in the forward mode through the CarbonTracker inversion setup to evaluate its consistency with CO2 concentration observations. The year 2004 was climatologically favorable for NEP over North America and the continental total was estimated at 1730 +/- 370TgCyr(-1) (a carbon sink). Harvested product emissions (316 +/- 80TgCyr(-1)), river/stream evasion (158 +/- 50TgCyr(-1)), and fire emissions (142 +/- 45TgCyr(-1)) counteracted a large proportion (35%) of the NEP sink. Geographic areas with strong carbon sinks included Midwest US croplands, and forested regions of the Northeast, Southeast, and Pacific Northwest. The forward mode run with CarbonTracker produced good agreement between observed and simulated wintertime CO2 concentrations aggregated over eight measurement sites around North America, but overestimates of summertime concentrations that suggested an underestimation of summertime carbon uptake. As terrestrial NEP is the dominant offset to fossil fuel emission over North America, a good understanding of its spatial and temporal variation - as well as the fate of the carbon it sequesters is needed for a comprehensive view of the carbon cycle.Show less"
18,"Zhao, T",Feb 2017 ,Coupled DEM-CFD investigation on the formation of landslide dams in narrow rivers,LANDSLIDES,"Large-scale landslide dams can induce significant hazards to human lives by blocking the river flows and causing inundation upstream. They may trigger severe outburst flooding that may devastate downstream areas once failed. Thus, the advancement in understanding the formation of landslide dams is highly necessary. This paper presents 3D numerical investigations of the formation of landslide dams in open fluid channels via the discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By employing this model, the influence of flow velocity on granular depositional morphology has been clarified. As the grains settle downwards in the fluid channel, positive excess water pressures are generated at the bottom region, reducing the total forces acting on the granular mass. In the meantime, the particle sedimentations into the fluid channel with high impacting velocities can generate fluid streams to flow backwards and forwards. The coupled hydraulic effects of excess water pressure and fluid flow would entrain the solid grains to move long distances along the channel. For simulations using different flow velocities, the larger the flow velocity is, the further distance the grains can be transported to. In this process, the solid grains move as a series of surges, with decreasing deposit lengths for the successive surges. The granular flux into the fluid channel has very little influence on the depositional pattern of particles, while it affects the particle-fluid interactions significantly. The results obtained from the DEM-CFD coupled simulations can reasonably explain the mechanisms of granular transportation and deposition in the formation of landslide dams in narrow rivers.Show less"

This tool predicts vertical and lateral cross-section variations for alluvial rivers, which is an important task in predicting the associated hazard zone after a flood event. The Model for the HYdraulics of SEdiments in Rivers, version 1.0 (MHYSER 1.0) is a semi-two-dimensional model using the stream tubes concept to achieve lateral variations of velocity, flow stresses, and sediment transport rates. Each stream tube has the same conveyance as the other ones. In MHYSER 1.0, the uncoupled approach is used to solve the set of conservation equations. After the backwater calculation, the river is divided into a finite number of stream tubes of equal conveyances. The sediment routing and bed adjustments calculations are accomplished separately along each stream tube taking into account lateral mass exchanges. The determination of depth and width adjustments is based on the minimum stream power theory. Moreover, MHYSER 1.0 offers two options to treat riverbank stability. The first one is based on the angle of repose. The bank slope should not be allowed to increase beyond a certain critical value supplied to MHYSER 1.0. The second one is based on the modified Bishop's method to determine a safety factor evaluating the potential risk of a landslide along the river bank.Show less"

Restricted by historical evolution, natural environment, resource endowments and other conditions, the economic and social development model of the Yellow River Basin region is outdated, and the level of economic and social development is relatively lagging, which hinders its coordinated development of ecology and economy. This paper uses the coupling coordination degree model, GIS spatial analysis method, NAR neural network model, spatial autoregression, and geographically weighted regression model to investigate the coupling coordination level, spatial differentiation characteristics, future development trend, and coupling driving factors of eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin. The results show that From 2003 to 2018, the level of eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in most areas of the Yellow River Basin gradually improved, presenting a spatial imbalance characteristic of ""high in the east and low in the west. The coupling coordination degree of eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in various regions of the Yellow River Basin increased year by year during the survey period. In 2018, most cities had been transformed into intermediate coordinated development areas, and most cities in Inner Mongolia and the middle and lower reaches south of the Yellow River have been upgraded to a well-coordinated development stage. The coupled and coordinated development relationship between eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin has significant spatial agglomeration characteristics, and the local spatial positive correlation gradually increases. From 2019 to 2023, the average level of coupling coordination between eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin during the forecast period is 0.802, 0.807, 0.809, 0.813, and 0.816, respectively, all of which have entered a stage of well-coordinated development. The coupled driving factors of ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin are ranked from strong to weak: energy utilization, urbanization, water resources development, and industrialization. Among them, the degree of energy utilization is the root of the differentiation of coupling coordination between eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in 74 regions of the Yellow River Basin. This study puts forward two strategic suggestions based on the optimal utilization strategy of energy and water resources and the coordinated promotion strategy of industrialization and urbanization, which has great practical and scientific significance for promoting the coordinated development of ecological environment protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin.Show less"

This vegetation creates natural biogeochemical barriers that drive mineralization processes and attenuate metals load in the stream. Several techniques, covering scales from micrometres to kilometres, were applied to investigate the biogeochemical processes: water chemistry, injected hydrologic tracer, mineralogy, microscopic investigation and X-ray spectroscopy. From this multiscale and multimethod approach, we recognized two predominant sets of biogeochemical processes: microbially driven metal sulphide precipitation, mainly resulting in pyrite formation; and plant uptake of metals that leads to formation of iron oxide-hydroxide and incorporation of Zn within the roots and aerial part (stem and leaves). The dense vegetation in the Rio San Giorgio streambed controls its morphology, velocity of streamflow, and, as reflected by observed bromide-tracer loss, enhanced water exchange between the streambed and the hyporheic zone. The combined effect of these vegetative controls is to establish biogeochemical barriers that greatly retard trace-metal mobility in the hyporheic zone. We estimated this effect can lead to an apparent decrease in Zn load up to 60%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
25,"Churchill, CJ",May 2018 ,Downstream dispersal of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) under different flow conditions in a coupled lake-stream ecosystem,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,"Dispersal, establishment, and spread of aquatic invasive species such as the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) can be influenced by riverine velocities and volumetric flows in invaded lake-stream ecosystems. Zebra mussels, which have a planktonic larval form (veliger), disperse rapidly downstream from a source population. Concentrations, dispersal, and body conditions of zebra mussel veligers were studied under different volumetric flow, or discharge, conditions in a coupled lake-stream ecosystem in northern Texas, USA. Veliger densities in lotic environments were strongly related to population dynamics in upstream lentic source populations. A strong exponential decrease in veliger density was observed through a 28-km downstream study reach. Increased water releases from the source reservoir increased veliger flux and dispersal potential, concomitantly increasing veliger flux and decreasing transit time. However, passage through release gates in the dam and increased turbulence in the river during high-discharge events could negatively affect body condition of veligers, and veliger body condition generally decreased from the source population to the farthest downstream site and was lower for veligers during periods of high discharge. Thus increased discharge appears to reduce the proportion of viable veligers because of increased turbulence-induced mortality. Colonization of distant downstream reservoirs can occur if discharge and propagule pressure are sufficient or if interim habitats are suitable for establishment of in-stream populations.Show less"
26,"Blackburn, J",Apr 2021 ,Hydrogeological controls on the flow regime of an ephemeral temperate stream flowing across an alluvial fan,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Alluvial fans often support ephemeral streams whose flow regimes and sediment dynamics are strongly controlled by fan sedimentary characteristics and interactions with shallow groundwater aquifers. The hydrogeology of such fans has most often been documented for large fans located within arid climate zones. This research focuses on a small (0.075 km(2)) alluvial fan situated in a temperate, high rainfall climate (the Lake District, North West England). An ephemeral stream flowing across this alluvial fan plays a key role in supplying water and sediment to the River Ehen, which is the focus of a habitat restoration initiative. This study combines high spatial resolution, near surface geophysics and outcrop data with hydrological data to characterise the hydrogeological properties of the alluvial fan. A conceptual hydrogeological model was developed to understand the hydrology across the alluvial fan and how that affects water and sediment supply to the River Ehen. The alluvial fan is composed predominantly of permeable debris flow deposits and numerous palaeochannels which may provide preferential groundwater flow paths. During streamflows, partial to full stream-aquifer connectivity occurs, especially in the distal fan where groundwater discharges back into the stream. Streamflows occur when the fan apex infiltration rate/capacity threshold of approx. 60 l/s(-1) is exceeded, typically following rainfall events >9-11 mm. Understanding interactions between ephemeral streams and their underlying aquifers enables better predictions of the timing and magnitude of future flows, and in-turn, their likely impacts on the water courses into which they discharge.Show less"
27,"Thanh, LD",Oct 2022 ,Application of critical path analysis to streaming potential coupling coefficient in porous media,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Streaming potential is a passive hydrogeophysical method that can be used to monitor water flow in porous media. However, a quantitative use of this method requires a good understanding of the streaming potential generation in water saturated porous media. In this work, we used the Critical Path Analysis (CPA) method to propose a new model to estimate the streaming potential coupling coefficient (SPCC) in porous media. By comparing the proposed model with 109 experimental data points for both unconsolidated samples such as uniform glass bead and sand packs and consolidated samples such as sandstones, carbonates and with 36 simulated data points, we demonstrated that the CPA is applicable to model the SPCC for porous media with both narrow and broad pore size distributions. Additionally, from the obtained result for the uniform grain packings, we found the r(c)-d relationship between the critical pore radius r(c )and grain diameter d that was validated by using 70 experimental data points available in literature. The obtained r(c)-d relationship may be helpful for applications of CPA-based models for uniform grain packings. We believe that the CPA-based model is an useful alternative approach for modeling the streaming potential coupling coefficient in porous media along with two other models available in literature.Show less"
28,"Liu, Y",Jul 2016 ,"Assessing sedimentological connectivity using WATEM/SEDEM model in a hilly and gully watershed of the Loess Plateau, China",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Sedimentological connectivity is an important issue in soil erosion and sediment transport. Landscape patterns, in combination with the rainfall regime, are known to shape such sedimentological connectivity. The quantification of sedimentological connectivity provides a link between sediment delivery and landscape pattern. There are two categories of connectivity: structural connectivity, which describes the physical coupling of landscape units, and functional connectivity, which delineates the linkage among landscape elements maintained by material transport. To quantify sedimentological connectivity, both the physical coupling of, and material transfer between, the various landscape components need to be assessed. This study quantifies the sedimentological connectivity of a headwater catchment in the Loess Plateau of China using the soil erosion and sediment delivery model (WATEM/SEDEM). Based on the model, two indicators of connectivity were developed: the area of sedimentologically effective catchment area (SEA) that contributes sediment to the sinks, and the minimum sediment output of locations on the flow path that link sources and sinks. This approach effectively represents the annual status of catchment-scale sedimentological connectivity and, furthermore, the simple structure and readily available input data make it highly practicable. However, for larger river systems in which sediment transport between sources and sinks occur over longer time scales and larger spatial scales, we suggest different techniques for quantifying the sediment flux and parameters delineating the physical coupling of landscape units.

29,"Thomaz, EL",Apr 15 2016 ,Hydrogeomorphic connectivity on roads crossing in rural headwaters and its effect on stream dynamics,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Unpaved roads are ubiquitous features that have been transforming the landscape through human history. Unpaved roads affect the water and sediment pathways through a catchment and impacts the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, we describe the effect of unpaved road on the hydrogeomorphic connectivity at the rural headwater scale. Measurement was based on the stream crossing approach, i.e., road superimposing the drainage system. We installed a Parshall flume coupled with single-stage suspended sediment sampler at each stream crossing. In addition, we displayed our monitoring scheme with an upscaling perspective from second-order to third order stream. We concluded that the road-stream coupling dramatically changed the stream dynamic. The increase of discharge caused by roads at the headwater was 50% larger compared to unaffected streams. Additionally, suspended sediment concentration enhancement at stream crossings ranged from to 413% at second-order streams to 145% al third-order streams. The landform characteristics associated with the wad network produced an important hydrogeomorphic disruption in the landscape. As a result, the sediment filter function of the riparian zone was reduced dramatically.Therefore, we recommend that projects for aquatic system restoration or conservation in rural landscape consider the role of the road network on stream dynamics.

The ARiD (Atmospheric River Detector) code has been developed to automatically detect atmospheric rivers from water vapor flux and has been applied to the ECMWF ERA5 archive over the period 1980-2020 above the Atlantic Ocean and Europe. A case study of an atmospheric river formed in the East Atlantic on August 2014 that reached France has been detailed using ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis, ground based observation data, and satellite products such as DARDAR, AIRS, GPCP, and GOES. This atmospheric river event presents a strong interaction with an intense upper tropospheric jet stream, which induced stratosphere-troposphere exchanges by tropopause fold. A 1980-2020 climatology of atmospheric rivers over Europe has been presented. The west of France, Iberian Peninsula, and British Islands are the most impacted regions by atmospheric rivers with an occurrence of up to four days per month during the October-April period. Up to 40% of the precipitation observed on the west European coast can be linked to the presence of ARs. No significant trend in the occurrence of the phenomena was found over 1980-2020.Show less"
31,"Conrad, BN",,Structural and functional connectivity of the inferior temporal numeral area,CEREBRAL CORTEX,"A growing body of evidence suggests that in adults, there is a spatially consistent ""inferior temporal numeral area"" (ITNA) in the occipitotemporal cortex that appears to preferentially process Arabic digits relative to non-numerical symbols and objects. However, very little is known about why the ITNA is spatially segregated from regions that process other orthographic stimuli such as letters, and why it is spatially consistent across individuals. In the present study, we used diffusion-weighted imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging to contrast structural and functional connectivity between left and right hemisphere ITNAs and a left hemisphere letter-preferring region. We found that the left ITNA had stronger structural and functional connectivity than the letter region to inferior parietal regions involved in numerical magnitude representation and arithmetic. Between hemispheres, the left ITNA showed stronger structural connectivity with the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), while the right ITNA showed stronger structural connectivity to the ipsilateral inferior parietal cortex and stronger functional coupling with the bilateral IPS. Based on their relative connectivity, our results suggest that the left ITNA may be more readily involved in mapping digits to verbal number representations, while the right ITNA may support the mapping of digits to quantity representations.Show less"

Cost-effective mini drive-point piezometers (MDPs) and multilevel samplers (MLSs) are presented that use cheap construction materials, involve simple fabrication and installation procedures, and have a proven durability with low vulnerability to flood events and vandalism. They have been used across a range of hydro(geo) logical settings in the UK and proven to be effective in discerning flow exchange, geochemical trends, and contaminant transport and attenuation over monitored depths of 0.25 to 2 m at a resolution as low as 0.05 m. Example depth profiles, cross-river transects and river-reach longitudinal profiles from the River Tame catchment (West Midlands, UK) illustrate the value of MDP-MLS approaches in establishing surface-water-groundwater mixing zone depths, contaminant natural attenuation as a result of biotic activity within the hyporheic zone, and estimates of contaminant flux exchanges between groundwater and surface water. The MDP-MLS approaches allow discernment of contaminated groundwater plume discharges that may go undetected, or at best poorly resolved, if reliance was solely placed on conventional riverside monitoring wells and/or surface-water sampling. The MDP-MLS approaches described also have potential to be used in the investigation of shallow sediment aquifers, lake shorelines and wetland features.Show less"

The proportions of CO2 emitted from streams and rivers that come from terrestrially derived CO2 or from CO2 produced within freshwater ecosystems through aquatic metabolism are not well quantified. Here we estimated CO2 emissions from running waters in the contiguous United States, based on freshwater chemical and physical characteristics and modelled gas transfer velocities at 1463 United States Geological Survey monitoring sites. We then assessed CO2 production from aquatic metabolism, compiled from previously published measurements of net ecosystem production from 187 streams and rivers across the contiguous United States. We find that CO2 produced by aquatic metabolism contributes about 28% of CO2 evasion from streams and rivers with flows between 0.0001 and 19,000 m(3) s(-1). We mathematically modelled CO2 flux from groundwater into running waters along a stream-river continuum to evaluate the relationship between stream size and CO2 source. Terrestrially derived CO2 dominates emissions from small streams, and the percentage of CO2 emissions from aquatic metabolism increases with stream size. We suggest that the relative role of rivers as conduits for terrestrial CO2 efflux and as reactors mineralizing terrestrial organic carbon is a function of their size and connectivity with landscapes.Show less"

The workshop brought together hydrologists, ecologists, biogeochemists, hydro-geologists and natural resource managers to discuss the processes that occur in hyporheic and riparian ecotones. The principal objectives were to share new ideas on the importance of biogeochemical processes that affect nutrients at the groundwater-surface water interface, to understand the impact of nutrient flux on stream (principally hyporheic) ecology, and to identify the management strategies for river corridors to mitigate the effects of nutrients applied to land and discharged via groundwater into rivers. The workshop concluded that: (1) more interdisciplinary research and environmental management practices are needed to better understand, predict and manage processes at the interface of environmental compartments; (2) the goal of environmental regulations to improve ecological health requires a holistic approach integrating our understanding of the ecological, hydrological, biogeochemical and physical processes; (3) upscaling spatially and temporally variable processes remains difficult and may hinder translation of research at micro-scales (molecular to grain size) into macro-scale (reach to catchment) decision-making; (4) scientists need to better communicate existing research to river managers, while smanagers must better communicate policy and regulatory-driven science requirements to researchers. Existing models, such as those that simulate stream-hyporheic exchange, are not widely known and rarely used by environmental managers. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
35,"Zimmer, MA",May 2020 ,Zero or not? Causes and consequences of zero-flow stream gage readings,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Streamflow observations can be used to understand, predict, and contextualize hydrologic, ecological, and biogeochemical processes and conditions in streams. Stream gages are point measurements along rivers where streamflow is measured, and are often used to infer upstream watershed-scale processes. When stream gages read zero, this may indicate that the stream has dried at this location; however, zero-flow readings can also be caused by a wide range of other factors. Our ability to identify whether or not a zero-flow gage reading indicates a dry fluvial system has far reaching environmental implications. Incorrect identification and interpretation by the data user can lead to inaccurate hydrologic, ecological, and/or biogeochemical predictions from models and analyses. Here, we describe several causes of zero-flow gage readings: frozen surface water, flow reversals, instrument error, and natural or human-driven upstream source losses or bypass flow. For these examples, we discuss the implications of zero-flow interpretations. We also highlight additional methods for determining flow presence, including direct observations, statistical methods, and hydrologic models, which can be applied to interpret causes of zero-flow gage readings and implications for reach- and watershed-scale dynamics. Such efforts are necessary to improve our ability to understand and predict surface flow activation, cessation, and connectivity across river networks. Developing this integrated understanding of the wide range of possible meanings of zero-flows will only attain greater importance in a more variable and changing hydrologic climate.This article is categorized under:Science of Water > MethodsScience of Water > Hydrological ProcessesWater and Life > Conservation, Management, and AwarenessShow less"
36,"Ren, HY",2021 ,Machine Learning Analysis of Hydrologic Exchange Flows and Transit Time Distributions in a Large Regulated River,FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"Hydrologic exchange between river channels and adjacent subsurface environments is a key process that influences water quality and ecosystem function in river corridors. High-resolution numerical models were often used to resolve the spatial and temporal variations of exchange flows, which are computationally expensive. In this study, we adopt Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) approaches for deriving reduced order models of hydrologic exchange flows and associated transit time distributions, with integrated field observations (e.g., bathymetry) and hydrodynamic simulation data (e.g., river velocity, depth). The setup allows an improved understanding of the influences of various physical, spatial, and temporal factors on the hydrologic exchange flows and transit times. The predictors also contain those derived using hybrid clustering, leveraging our previous work on river corridor system hydromorphic classification. The machine learning-based predictive models are developed and validated along the Columbia River Corridor, and the results show that the top parameters are the thickness of the top geological formation layer, the flow regime, river velocity, and river depth; the RF and XGB models can achieve 70% to 80% accuracy and therefore are effective alternatives to the computational demanding numerical models of exchange flows and transit time distributions. Each machine learning model with its favorable configuration and setup have been evaluated. The transferability of the models to other river reaches and larger scales, which mostly depends on data availability, is also discussed.Show less"
37,"Radinger, J",Nov 2020 ,The role of connectivity in the interplay between climate change and the spread of alien fish in a large Mediterranean river,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Understanding how global change and connectivity will jointly modify the distribution of riverine species is crucial for conservation biology and environmental management. However, little is known about the interaction between climate change and fragmentation and how movement barriers might impede native species from adjusting their distributions versus limit the further spread of alien species. In this study, we modelled the current and future distributions of 11 native and five alien fishes in the large and heavily fragmented Ebro River, located within the Mediterranean region, which has many freshwater endemics severely threatened by global change. We considered 10 climate change models and five modelling algorithms and assessed the effects of connectivity on the accessibility of future suitable habitats. Thereby, we identify most conflict-prone river reaches, that is, where barriers pose a particular trade-off between isolating and negatively impacting native species versus potentially reducing the risk of alien species spread. Our results projected upstream habitat shifts for the vast majority of the species. Climate change affected species differently, with alien species generally showing larger habitat gains compared to natives. Most pronounced distributional changes (i.e. losses of native species and gains of alien species) and compositional turnover might be expected in the lower and mid reaches of large tributaries of the Ebro River. The role of anthropogenic barriers in this context is often ambiguous but rather unfavourable, as they not only restrict native fishes but also alter stream habitats and flow conditions. However, with our spatial modelling framework, we could identify specific river reaches where the connectivity trade-off in the context of climate change is particularly relevant. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of the complex effects that climate change, riverine connectivity and alien species are expected to impose on river communities and the urgent need to adapt management strategies accordingly.Show less"
38,"Cardenas, MB",Nov 30 2008 ,The effect of river bend morphology on flow and timescales of surface water-groundwater exchange across pointbars,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Head gradients along meandering rivers induce surface water-groundwater exchange across pointbars. We analyze this exchange process by finite-element modeling of groundwater flow and transport through model-generated river planforms taken from previous studies. The river is considered as a constant-head boundary that decreases linearly along the direction of the channel. This leads to an irregular groundwater flowfield in the pointbar that is controlled by channel sinuosity. Simulations under homogeneous aquifer conditions shows that the variable flowpath lengths coupled with the heterogeneous flow velocities lead to non-Fickian transport characterized by power-law residence time distributions. This anomalous transport behavior is enhanced by increased aquifer dispersivity. The broad transit time distribution implies that time-dependent chemical transformation processes in near-stream zones may be equally variable as the flowfield, even in the absence of heterogeneity in aquifer hydraulic properties.

39,"Gao, JH",May 15 2014 ,"Changes in water and sediment exchange between the Changjiang River and Poyang Lake under natural and anthropogenic conditions, China",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"To study the fluvial interaction between Changjiang River and Poyang Lake, we analyze the observed changes of riverine flux of the mid-upstream of Changjiang River catchment, the five river systems of Poyang Lake and Poyang Lake basin. Inter-annual and seasonal variations of the water discharge and sediment exchange processes between Changjiang River and Poyang Lake are systematically explored to determine the influence of climate change as well as human impact (especially the Three Gorges Dam (TGD)). Results indicate that climate variation for the Changjiang catchment and Poyang Lake watershed is the main factor determining the changes of water exchanges between Changjiang River and Poyang Lake. However, human activities (including the emplacement of the TGD) accelerated this rate of change. Relative to previous years (1956-1989), the water discharge outflow from Poyang lake during the dry season towards the Changjiang catchment increased by 8.98 km(3) y(-1) during 2003-2010. Evidently, the water discharge flowing into Poyang Lake during late April late May decreased. As a consequence, water storage of Poyang Lake significantly reduced during late April late May, resulting in frequent spring droughts after 2003. The freshwater flux of Changjiang River towards Poyang Lake is less during the flood season as well, significantly lowering the magnitude and frequency of the backflow of the Changjiang River during 2003-2010. Human activities, especially the emplacement and operation of the TGD and sand mining at Poyang Lake impose a major impact on the variation of sediment exchange between Changjiang main river and Poyang Lake. On average, sediments from Changjiang River deposited in Poyang Lake before 2000. After 2000, Changjiang River no longer supplied sediment to Poyang Lake. As a consequence, the sediment load of Changjiang River entering the sea increasingly exists of sediments from Lake Poyang during 2003-2010. As a result, Poyang Lake converted from a depositional to an erosional system, with a gross sediment loss of 120.19 Mt y(-1) during 2001-2010, including sand mining. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the study, a typical peri-urban river, Nansha River, was selected as a case study to discuss the scheme of peri-urban river rehabilitation. Located in the north part of the Beijing central region, the Nansha River watershed has been designated as an ecologically friendly garden-style area with high-tech industry parks and upscale residential zones. However, the Nansha River is currently seriously contaminated by urban and rural pollutants from both nonpoint sources (NPS) and point sources (PS). In this study, the pollutant loads from point sources and nonpoint sources in the Nansha River watershed were first assessed. A coupled model, derived from the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code and Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program, was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics and water quality in the Nansha River. According to the characteristics of the typical peri-urban river, three different PS and NPS control scenarios were designed and examined by modeling analyses. Based on the results of the scenario analysis, a river rehabilitation scheme was recommended for implementation.Show less"
41,"Hu, SM",Jul 2021 ,Novel evolutionary-EAC instance-learning-based algorithm for fast data stream mining in assisted living with extreme connectivity,COMPUTING,"In modern healthcare, sensing technologies such as IoT empower the quality of assisted living service by knowing what a resident is doing in real-time. Using extreme connectivity and cloud computing in a smart home, where a collection of sensors is installed, the sensors sample continuously from the movements of the resident as well as ambient data from the surrounding inside the house. Automatic human activity recognition of the resident's activities is one of the key components of assisted living in smart home. For monitoring in-home safety, the ability in recognizing abnormal activities such as accident, falling, acute disease attack (e.g. asthma, stroke, etc.), fainting, wobbling, is particularly important. The detection and machine learning process must be both accurate and fast, to cope with the real-time activity recognition. To this end, a novel streamlined sensor data processing method is proposed called Evolutionary Expand-and-Contract Instance-based Learning algorithm (EEAC-IBL). The multivariate data stream is first expanded into many subspaces, then the subspaces which are corresponding to the characteristics of the features are selected and condensed into a significant feature subset. The selection operates scholastically instead of deterministically by evolutionary optimization which approximates the best subgroup. Followed by data stream mining, the machine learning for activity recognition is done on the fly. This approach is unique and suitable for such extreme connectivity scenario where precise feature selection is not required, and the relative importance of each feature among the sensor data changes over time. This stochastic approximation method is fast and accurate, offering an alternative to traditional machine learning method for smart home activity recognition application. Our experimental results show computing advantages over other classical approaches.Show less"

The flow directions are based on a digital elevation model and on information on the locations of major rivers ('stream burning'). The presented river routing network is specifically designed for the assessment of fresh water shortages. We tested the validity of the river routing network by comparing the computed drainage areas with published estimates. This comparison revealed a good similarity and it is concluded that the presented river routing network has sufficient quality to be implemented in global climate models.

43,"Briggs, MA",Feb 23 2012 ,Using high-resolution distributed temperature sensing to quantify spatial and temporal variability in vertical hyporheic flux,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic flow can be extremely variable in space and time, and our understanding of complicated flow systems, such as exchange around small dams, has generally been limited to reach-averaged parameters or discrete point measurements. Emerging techniques are starting to fill the void between these disparate scales, increasing the utility of hyporheic research. When ambient diurnal temperature patterns are collected at high spatial resolution across vertical profiles in the streambed, the data can be applied to one-dimensional conduction-advection-dispersion models to quantitatively describe the vertical component of hyporheic flux at the same high spatial resolution. We have built on recent work by constructing custom fiber-optic distributed temperature sensors with 0.014 m spatial resolution that are robust enough to be installed by hand into the streambed, maintain high signal strength, and permit several sensors to be run in series off a single distributed temperature sensing unit. Data were collected continuously for 1 month above two beaver dams in a Wyoming stream to determine the spatial and temporal nature of vertical flux induced by the dams. Flux was organized by streambed morphology with strong, variable gradients with depth indicating a transition to horizontal flow across a spectrum of hyporheic flow paths. Several profiles showed contrasting temporal trends as discharge decreased by 45%. The high-resolution thermal sensors, combined with powerful analytical techniques, allowed a distributed quantitative description of the morphology-driven hyporheic system not previously possible.Show less"
44,"Wallace, CD",May 28 2020 ,Nitrate Removal Within Heterogeneous Riparian Aquifers Under Tidal Influence,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Tides in coastal rivers drive river-groundwater (hyporheic) exchange and provide opportunities for nitrate removal that may improve coastal water quality. Silt and sand layers in coastal floodplain sediments can alter the flow and transformation of nitrate. Our goal was to understand how sediment heterogeneity influences nitrogen dynamics near tidal rivers. Numerical simulations show that oxic, variably saturated sand layers and anoxic, organic-rich silt layers are sites of nitrification and denitrification, respectively. The exchange of river water and nitrate through heterogeneous sediments increases with sand fraction, as sand lenses become longer and more connected. The amount of nitrate removed from river water also increases but represents a smaller portion of total nitrate exchange through the hyporheic zone, causing removal efficiency to decline. Our results suggest that accurate characterization of aquifer heterogeneity leads to an improved understanding of sites of nutrient transformation within floodplain sediments.Plain Language Summary Excess nitrate can degrade coastal water quality, but microbial reactions reduce its concentration within the bed and banks of tidal rivers, where surface water and groundwater mix. Spatial arrangements of different sediments (sand and mud) affect the mixing of river water and groundwater and thus affect nitrate removal. Here, we use computer models to simulate nitrate transformation along a tidal river with different amounts of coarse and fine sediments. Coarse sediments promote groundwater flow and nitrate production, while fine sediments promote nitrate removal. The amount of nitrate removed from river water is greater in aquifers with coarser sediments, but the removal efficiency decreases. Removal also varies with the spatial distribution of sand and mud in sediments but to a lesser degree. Computer models of nitrate transport should consider the distribution of different sediment types.Show less"
45,"Pinter, N",Jul 2019 ,River research and applications across borders,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Rivers flow across national borders, unfettered by political distinctions, and the ecological health of rivers is closely linked to their degree of connectivity. River research today is more global than it has ever been, but we show that river research, engineering, and management still operate within homegrown local paradigms. As a basis for this discussion, we studied the citation networks surrounding the most widely cited papers in our field, assessing the degree to which researchers have collaborated across geographical boundaries and fully drawn from the international literature. Despite gains over time, our field remains surprisingly and pervasively provincial. The likely explanation for provincial bias is that researchers are generally more familiar and comfortable with their own research methods, sites, and agendas. However, local focus has tangible consequences. For example, contrasting paradigms and differing approaches to river restoration and to flood-risk management show that opportunities are lost when we fail to learn from the successes and failures of other regions. As we look to the future, increased engagement across political and intellectual and physical borders should propel the field of river science into new and exciting directions.Show less"
46,"Lamontagne, S",Feb 15 2014 ,"Field assessment of surface water-groundwater connectivity in a semi-arid river basin (Murray-Darling, Australia)",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In semi-arid and arid river basins, understanding the connectivity between rivers and alluvial aquifers is one of the key challenges for the management of groundwater resources. The type of connection present (gaining, losing-connected, transitional and losing-disconnected) was assessed at 12 sites along six Murray-Darling Basin river reaches. The assessments were made by measuring the hydraulic head in the riparian zone near the rivers to evaluate if the water tables intersected the riverbeds and by measuring fluid pressure () in the riverbeds. The rationale for the latter was that will always be greater than or equal to zero under connected conditions (either losing or gaining) and always lesser than or equal to zero under losing-disconnected conditions. A mixture of losing-disconnected, losing-connected and gaining conditions was found among the 12 sites. The losing-disconnected sites all had a riverbed with a lower hydraulic conductivity than the underlying aquifer, usually in the form of a silty clay or clay unit 0.5-2m in thickness. The riparian water tables were 6 to 25m below riverbed level at the losing-disconnected sites but never lower than 1m below riverbed level at the losing-connected ones. The contrast in water table depth between connected and disconnected sites was attributed to the conditions at the time of the study, when a severe regional drought had generated a widespread decline in regional water tables. This decline was apparently compensated near losing-connected rivers by increased infiltration rates, while the decline could not be compensated at the losing-disconnected rivers because the infiltration rates were already maximal there.

Currently, the Yellow River Basin, which is short on water resources, has a fragile natural ecology, and lags in economic and social development, is a key and difficult area for the ecological security and economic and social development of China. This paper summarizes the remarkable achievements in comprehensive prevention and control of soil erosion, such as the implementation of a series of major ecological projects, in the Yellow River Basin since the founding of New China, especially in recent years. These major ecological projects were implemented based on the different characteristics of the upstream, midstream, and downstream regions of the Yellow River Basin. However, the ecological function of the Yellow River Basin has not been fundamentally resolved. This is due to three main masons. The first is the extent and spatial imbalance in the control of water and soil erosion in the Yellow River Basin watershed. Ecosystem quality has degraded and water conservation has declined in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, soil erosion is serious in the middle reaches, and the ecological flow is low and some estuary wetlands have shrunk in the lower reaches. The second reason is the adverse effect of water and sediment regulation on delta and coastal systems. Vegetation coverage has declined at the source of the Yellow River, there is the desertification of grasslands and the area of secondary bare lands has increased. Some degraded black-soil beaches have undergone secondary degradation and associated disasters have also increased. The third reason includes water and sediment problems caused by large-scale coal mining, such as serious changes in topography and landforms. There is the acceleration of land desertification and water shortages, where the original landforms are destroyed and some vegetation disappears in the upper reaches; the ground collapses and serious soil erosion causes increased sediments to flow into the Yellow River in the middle reaches. Surface subsidence deformation, water accumulation, and secondary salinization lead to a decrease in land productivity in the lower reaches. It is proposed that the key to solving the current outstanding problems restricting ecological protection and high-quality sustainable development of the Yellow River Basin lies in the integrity of the water ecology of the basin, spatial-temporal connectivity and ecosystem health to realize the scientific allocation of water resources in ecology, industry/mining, life, agriculture, and water and sediment regulation in the context of climate warming. To realize this scientific objective, three tasks of research are urgently needed. First, the clarification of the theory and technology of the digital Yellow River information platform, and timely and accurate determination of the river's status are critical to understand and scientifically develop and manage the Yellow River Basin.Second, water resource monitoring and cloud water resource development and utilization across the entire Yellow River Basin must be carried out, which will require full use of advanced technologies, such as artificial weather modification, rational development and utilization of cloud water resources, the construction of water resource monitoring and cloud water resource development and utilization as soon as possible, and promotion of the effective use of water resources. Finally, identification and prediction of major ecological disaster risks are essential, which requires the integration of space-air-ground stereo observation; big data and machine learning; fusion of 50, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and other technical methods to establish the intelligent perception and identification of precursors for major disasters; disaster scenario simulation and risk prediction; and disaster risk prevention and control technology systems to enhance risk identification and management capabilities in ecological protection and high-quality sustainable development.Show less"
48,"Poeppl, RE",Sep 20 2020 ,Managing sediment (dis)connectivity in fluvial systems,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Globally, rivers systems are under considerable and increasing threat from multiple anthropogenic stresses, including different types of direct (e.g. channel engineering) and indirect human impacts (e.g. land cover and land use changes) that alter water and sediment dynamics. (Dis)connectivity relationships determine the source, timing and rates of water and sediment flux in catchments and thus their geomorphic sensitivity to disturbance. However, most river and catchment management plans overlook the role of sediment (dis)connectivity. Here we use examples from different environmental settings with different sediment-related problems to show how understandings of sediment (dis)connectivity can inform catchment-based management plans. We focus on concerns for river conservation and recovery, using examples from Austria, New Zealand and Australia. Finally, we present questions for practitioners to consider to appropriately contextualise management applications when using (dis)connectivity concepts in practice. Our findings revealed that differences in sediment (dis)connectivity relationships exert profound catchment-specific variability in (eco)-geomorphic response to disturbance. Understanding (dis)connectivity and system history is therefore essential to forecast the effects of on-ground management actions. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
49,"Zahraeifard, V",Apr 2012 ,VART Model-Based Method for Estimation of Instream Dissolved Oxygen and Reaeration Coefficient,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Dissolved oxygen (DO) is essential to maintaining flora and fauna in aquatic ecosystems. The DO replenishment through the surface reaeration mechanism is commonly described using the reaeration coefficient (K-2). This paper presents a new approach to modeling instream DO and estimating K-2. The new approach includes an extension of the Variable Residence Time (VART) model and optimization algorithms for inverse modeling. The VART model is modified in this paper to incorporate the DO reaeration mechanism across the air-water interface, forming the VART-DO model. A major advantage of the VART-DO model is that it is capable of simulating DO exchange across the water-sediment interface through the hyporheic exchange mechanism in addition to the air-water exchange. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the relative importance of key model parameters to DO modeling. It is found that the K-2 value increases markedly with the dispersion coefficient. The simplex-simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm are used to optimize the estimation of the parameter K-2. A comparison of the optimized K-2 value from the VART-DO model with those from existing empirical equations reveals that K-2 value could increase 1.5 to 6 times when the effects of the dispersion and hyporheic exchange mechanisms on DO are taken into account. The results from the VART-DO model provide new insights into the DO variation in streams and rivers. The VART-DO model also provides a general and effective tool for total maximum daily load (TMDL) calculations of DO. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000494.
