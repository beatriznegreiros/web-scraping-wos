The connectivity of runoff source areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina, USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands. Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths. The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to, and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral, longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation processes.Show less"
1,"Teitelbaum, Y",Feb 28 2022 ,A Novel Framework for Simulating Particle Deposition With Moving Bedforms,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Previous modeling studies of hyporheic exchange induced by moving bedforms have used a moving reference frame, typically corresponding to an individual moving bedform. However, this approach is not suitable for simulating the exchange and accumulation of immobile fine particles beneath moving bedforms, which commonly occurs in sand-bed streams, as both moving and stationary features must be considered. Here we present a novel simulation framework that may represent arbitrarily shaped, generally aperiodic mobile bedforms within a stationary reference frame. We combine this approach with particle tracking to successfully reproduce observations of clay deposition in sand beds, and the resulting development of a low-conductivity layer near the scour zone. We find that increased bedform celerity and filtration both lead to a shallower depth of clay deposition and a more compact deposition layer. While increased filtration causes more clay to deposit, increased celerity reduces deposition by flattening hyporheic exchange flowpaths.Show less"
2,"Jarvie, HP",Dec 4 2018 ,Coupling High-Frequency Stream Metabolism and Nutrient Monitoring to Explore Biogeochemical Controls on Downstream Nitrate Delivery,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Instream biogeochemical process measurements are often short-term and localized. Here we use in situ sensors to quantify the net effects of biogeochemical processes on seasonal patterns in baseflow nitrate retention at the river-reach scale. Dual-station high-frequency in situ nitrate measurements, were coupled with high-frequency measurements of stream metabolism and dissolved inorganic carbon, in a tributary of the Buffalo National River, Arkansas. Nitrate assimilation was calculated from net primary production, and combined with mass-balance measurements, to estimate net nitrification and denitrification. The combined net effects of these instream processes (assimilation, denitrification, and nitrification) removed >30-90% of the baseflow nitrate load along a 6.5 km reach. Assimilation of nitrate by photoautotrophs during spring and early summer was buffered by net nitrification. Net nitrification peaked during the spring. After midsummer, there was a pronounced switch from assimilatory nitrate uptake to denitrification. There was clear synchronicity between the switch from nitrate assimilation to denitrification, a reduction in river baseflows, and a shift in stream metabolism from autotrophy to heterotrophy. The results show how instream nitrate retention and downstream delivery is driven by seasonal shifts in metabolic pathways; and how continuous in situ stream sensor networks offer new opportunities for quantifying the role of stream biota in the dynamics, fate, and transport of nitrogen in fluvial systems.Show less"

Characterization of component connectivity,PHYSICAL REVIEW E,"Essential to understanding the overall structure of river networks is a knowledge of their detailed architecture. Here we explore the presence of randomness in river network structure and the details of its consequences. We first show that an averaged view of network architecture is provided by a proposed self-similarity statement about the scaling of drainage density, a local measure of stream concentration. This scaling of drainage density is shown to imply Tokunaga's law, a description of the scaling of side branch abundance along a given stream, as well as a scaling law for stream lengths. We then consider fluctuations in drainage density and consequently the numbers of side branches. Data are analyzed for the Mississippi River basin and a model of random directed networks. Numbers of side streams are found to follow exponential distributions, as are intertributary distances along streams. Finally, we derive a joint variation of side stream abundance with stream length, affording a full description of fluctuations in network structure. Fluctuations in side stream numbers are shown to be a direct result of fluctuations in stream lengths. This is the last paper in a series of three on the geometry of river networks.Show less"
5,"Garcea, FE",Jul 2018 ,Task- and domain-specific modulation of functional connectivity in the ventral and dorsal object-processing pathways,BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION,"A whole-brain network of regions collectively supports the ability to recognize and use objects-the Tool Processing Network. Little is known about how functional interactions within the Tool Processing Network are modulated in a task-dependent manner. We designed an fMRI experiment in which participants were required to either generate object pantomimes or to carry out a picture matching task over the same images of tools, while holding all aspects of stimulus presentation constant across the tasks. The Tool Processing Network was defined with an independent functional localizer, and functional connectivity within the network was measured during the pantomime and picture matching tasks. Relative to tool picture matching, tool pantomiming led to an increase in functional connectivity between ventral stream regions and left parietal and frontal-motor areas; in contrast, the matching task was associated with an increase in functional connectivity among regions in ventral temporo-occipital cortex, and between ventral temporal regions and the left inferior parietal lobule. Graph-theory analyses over the functional connectivity data indicated that the left premotor cortex and left lateral occipital complex were hub-like (exhibited high betweenness centrality) during tool pantomiming, while ventral stream regions (left medial fusiform gyrus and left posterior middle temporal gyrus) were hub-like during the picture matching task. These results demonstrate task-specific modulation of functional interactions among a common set of regions, and indicate dynamic coupling of anatomically remote regions in task-dependent manner.Show less"
6,"Spurgeon, JJ",Sep 2018 ,Spatial structure of large-river fish populations across main-stem and tributary habitats,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The spatial variability in demographic parameters represents fundamental information for conservation and management of large-river fish populations. We assessed demographic processes including survival and movement across macroscale habitats in a large-river network using 2 candidate large-river species with contrasting life history strategies. We used mark-recapture data and a multistate model framework to estimate survival and transition probabilities between main-stem and tributary habitats for both channel catfish and shovelnose sturgeon. Annual survival for channel catfish was similar in main-stem and tributary habitats (range in S=0.47-0.58). Annual survival for shovelnose sturgeon was less in the tributary (S=0.68) compared with the main stem (S=0.83). The probability of movement among macroscale habitats differed between species. However, the greatest probability of movement occurred from the tributary to the main-stem for both channel catfish (=0.42) and shovelnose sturgeon (=0.27). Movement between main-stem and tributary rivers may be a prominent characteristic for both channel catfish and shovelnose sturgeon and could influence population demographic rates and abundance across systems. Riverine fish populations are likely structured across multiple salient scalesincluding tributary and main-stem habitats. Consideration of connectivity across tributary and main-stem habitats with respect to species' life history strategy and life stage may better integrate a systems' perspective for conservation and management of large-river fish populations.Show less"
7,"Tsartsali, EE",Jun 2022 ,Impact of resolution on the atmosphere-ocean coupling along the Gulf Stream in global high resolution models,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,"We have investigated the horizontal resolution dependence of the ocean-atmosphere coupling along the Gulf Stream, of simulations made by six Global Climate Models according to the HighResMIP protocol, and compared it with reanalysis and remote sensing observations. Two ocean-atmosphere interaction mechanisms are explored in detail: The Vertical Mixing Mechanism (VMM) associated with the intensification of downward momentum transfer, and the Pressure Adjustment Mechanism (PAM) associated with secondary circulations driven by pressure gradients. Both VMM and PAM are found to be active even in the eddy-parameterized models. However, increasing ocean and/or atmosphere resolution leads to enhanced ocean-atmosphere coupling and improved agreement with reanalysis and observations. Our results indicate that while one part of the stronger air-sea coupling is attributable to the refinement of the oceanic component to eddy-permitting, optimal results are obtained only by further increase of the atmosphere resolution too. The use of the eddy-resolving model show weaker or same coupling strength over the eddy-permitting resolution. We conclude that at least eddy-permiting ocean resolution and comparable atmosphere resolution are required for a reliable ocean-atmosphere coupling along the Gulf Stream.Show less"
8,"van de Wolfshaar, KE",Sep 2011 ,"Linking Flow Regime, Floodplain Lake Connectivity and Fish Catch in a Large River-Floodplain System, the Volga-Akhtuba Floodplain (Russian Federation)",ECOSYSTEMS,"River-floodplain systems are amongst the most productive-but often severely impacted-aquatic systems worldwide. We explored the ecological response of fish to flow regime in a large river-floodplain system by studying the relationships between (1) discharge and inundated floodplain area, with a focus on spatial and temporal patterns in floodplain lake connectivity, and (2) flood volume and fisheries catch. Our results demonstrate a non-linear relationship between discharge and floodplain inundation with considerable hysteresis due to differences in inundation and drainage rate. Inundation extent was mostly determined by flood volume, not peak discharge. We found that the more isolated lakes (that is, lakes with a shorter connection duration to the river) are located at higher local elevation and at larger hydrological distance from the main rivers: geographical distance to the river appears a poor predictor of lake isolation. Although year-to-year fish catches in the floodplain were significantly larger with larger flood volumes in the floodplain, they were not in the main river, suggesting that mechanisms that increase catch, such as increased floodplain access or increased somatic growth, are stimulated by flooding in the floodplain, but not in the river. Fish species that profit from flooding belong to different feeding guilds, suggesting that all trophic levels may benefit from flooding. We found indications that the ecological functioning of floodplains is not limited to its temporary availability as habitat. Refugia can be present within the floodplain itself, which should be considered in the management of large rivers and their floodplain.Show less"
9,"Joo, H",Apr 2021 ,Stream gauge network grouping analysis using community detection,STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,"Stream gauging stations are important in hydrology and water science for obtaining water-related information, such as stage and discharge. However, for efficient operation and management, a more accurate grouping method is needed, which should be based on the interrelationships between stream gauging stations. This study presents a grouping method that employs community detection based on complex networks. The proposed grouping method was compared with the cluster analysis approach, which is based on statistics, to verify its adaptability. To achieve this goal, 39 stream gauging stations in the Yeongsan River basin of South Korea were investigated. The numbers of groups (clusters) in the study were two, four, six, and eight, which were determined to be suitable by fusion coefficient analysis. Ward's method was employed for cluster analysis, and multilevel modularity optimization was applied for community detection. A higher level of cohesion between stream gauging stations was observed in the community detection method at the basin scale and the stream link scale within the basin than in the cluster analysis. This suggests that community detection is more effective than cluster analysis in terms of hydrologic similarity, persistence, and connectivity. As such, these findings could be applied to grouping methods for efficient operation and maintenance of stream gauging stations.Show less"
10,"Malcolm, IA",Nov 2005 ,Catchment-scale controls on groundwater-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone: Implications for salmon embryo survival,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The spatial and temporal variability of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions in the hyporheic zone were investigated in a semi-pristine upland salmon spawning catchment (Girnock Burn) in the Cairngorm Mountains, northeast Scotland. Stream and hyporheic water quality (200-300 mm depth) were monitored fortnightly at 16 spawning locations distributed throughout the catchment. Hydrochemical tracers were used to assess local GW-SW interactions. Stratified streambed incubators (50-300 mm) provided information on salmon embryo mortality at a sub-set of ten locations. Hyporheic water quality varied both temporally and spatially according to local GW-SW interactions. It was possible to categorize sites into three broad typologies reflecting local stream-aquifer interactions: (1) groundwater-dominated; (2) surface water-dominated; and (3) sites exhibiting transient water table features. Groundwater upwelling occurred in areas where low permeability glacial moraine features caused substantive valley constriction. These locations were also conducive to accumulation of spawning grade gravels and consequently were utilized heavily by spawning salmon. Long residence groundwater was typically characterized by low dissolved oxygen (DO), of sufficiently low quality to be detrimental to salmon embryo survival. At sites dominated by surface water, hyporheic DO remained high throughout and rates of embryo survival were correspondingly high. Survival rates were also high at sites where hydrochemical characteristics indicated a transient water table. This is probably attributable to the hydrological conditions which resulted in increasing DO concentrations towards hatch time when embryo oxygen demand is at its maximum. The degree to which the findings of this study are directly applicable to other catchments is currently unknown. However, similar effects have been observed elsewhere, and based on the information presented here, there are clear implications for fisheries managers who may wish to consider the use of surface incubation facilities to negate the effects of low DO groundwater upwelling where it dominates available spawning habitat. It is suggested that future research should aim to integrate across spatial scales and disciplines to obtain a better understanding of the ways in which hillslope and riparian zone hydrology affect GW-SW interactions, hyporheic zone processes and stream ecology.

12,"Descloux, S",Oct 2013 ,Benthic and hyporheic invertebrate assemblages along a gradient of increasing streambed colmation by fine sediment,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Streambed colmation by fine sediment, e.g. the deposition, accumulation and storage of fines in the substrate, is a major environmental concern throughout the world. Nevertheless, the ecological effects of streambed colmation on both benthic and hyporheic invertebrate assemblages have rarely been considered simultaneously. We studied a continuum of a naturally increasing percentage of fine sediment in three temperate rivers and hypothesized that the increasing percentage of fine sediment would decrease both benthic and hyporheic invertebrate densities and diversities, and reduce the similarities between them. To test these hypotheses, we first compared heavily, moderately and lightly clogged reaches located in downwelling areas and sampled invertebrates in the benthic zone and at 3 different depths (10, 30 and 50 cm) in the hyporheic zone. Secondly, we modified the sediment grain size distribution experimentally by increasing the percentage of fine sediment and using artificial substrates. The increasing colmation halved the hyporheic taxonomic richness and reduced benthic and hyporheic densities to a third. Some taxa were found in both zones, mainly in high colmation (e.g. Baetidae) or low colmation contexts (e.g. Orthocladiinae, Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida). The dissimilarity between benthic and hyporheic fauna (only at -50 cm) was significantly higher in heavily clogged reaches than in moderately and lightly clogged ones, suggesting reduced vertical exchange of invertebrates or differential impacts between zones. The total abundance, taxonomic richness, percentage of EPT taxa and densities of most organisms observed using the artificial substrates decreased linearly with the increasing percentage of fine sediment in the experiment. Only the Ephemeroptera Caenis spp. and Heptageniidae disappeared above 30 and 50 % of fine sediment, respectively, suggesting that the response to increasing colmation are strongly taxon-specific. High amount of fine sediments within the substrate significantly decreased habitat quality for benthic and hyporheic invertebrates and thus limit the production of streams and their capacity to recover after disturbance. Moreover, the use of hyporheic invertebrates seems more relevant than benthic invertebrates to assess the effect of colmation and thus could be tested in future research as indicators.Show less"
13,"Tsai, CH",Jul 2022 ,Transient Storage Model Parameter Optimization Using the Simulated Annealing Method,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange in streams is critical to ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling along river corridors, especially for slowly moving or small stream systems. The transient storage model (TSM) has been widely used for modeling of hyporheic exchange. TSM calibration, for hyporheic exchange, is typically used to estimate four parameters, including the mass exchange rate coefficient, the dispersion coefficient, stream cross-sectional area, and hyporheic zone cross-sectional area. Prior studies have raised concerns regarding the non-uniqueness of the inverse problem for the TSM, that is, the occurrence of different parameter vectors resulting in TSM solution that reproduces the observed in-stream tracer break through curve (BTC) with the same error. This leads to practical non-identifiability in determining the unknown parameter vector values even when global-optimal values exist, and the parameter optimization becomes practically non-unique. To address this problem, we applied the simulated annealing method to calibrate the TSM to BTCs, because it is less susceptible to local minima-induced non-identifiability. A hypothetical (or synthetic) tracer test data set with known parameters was developed to demonstrate the capability of the simulated annealing method to find the global minimum parameter vector, and it identified the ""hypothetically-true"" global minimum parameter vector even with input data that were modified with up to 10% noise without increasing the number of iterations required for convergence. The simulated annealing TSM was then calibrated using two in-stream tracer tests conducted in East Fork Poplar Creek, Tennessee. Simulated annealing was determined to be appropriate for quantifying the TSM parameter vector because of its search capability for the global minimum parameter vector.Show less"
14,"Lisuzzo, NJ",2008 ,"Hydrologic controls on nitrogen availability in a high-latitude, semi-arid floodplain",ECOSCIENCE,"Past research shows a discrepancy between apparent nitrogen supply and the annual growth requirements for early successional plant Communities along the Tanana River floodplain in interior Alaska. Because previous measurements of nitrogen fixation, mineralization, and deposition can only account for approximately 26% of these communities' nitrogen requirements, other mechanisms of nitrogen supply should be operating. This study examined the potential for Subsurface hydrology to supply nitrogen to the rooting zones of early Successional plant communities. Three transects of ground water wells were established along the floodplain, and hydrologic characteristics and soil/water chemistry were measured for 2 y. Hydrologic measurements were then used to model the potential nitrogen contributions from advective flow and capillary rise. Ion exchange membranes and stable isotope tracers were used to identify the use of hyporheic nitrogen by vegetation. Nitrogen accumulation on ion exchange membranes showed a large input of nitrogen during a period of high water in 2003. Plants showed uptake of hyporheic N-15-labelled nitrogen at 2 of 4 locations. Models of capillary rise and advective flow estimated that nitrogen supply from subsurface water equalled or exceeded total nitrogen supply from nitrogen mineralization and processes in controlling nutrient supply nitrogen fixation combined. These findings underscore the of hyporheic to early successional vegetation on the Tanana River floodplain.Show less"
15,"Granados, V",Apr 15 2020 ,The interruption of longitudinal hydrological connectivity causes delayed responses in dissolved organic matter,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Hydrology is the main driver of dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams. However, it is still unclear how the timing and the spatial variation in flow connectivity affect the dynamics of DOM and inorganic solutes.This study focuses on the impact of flow cessation on the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of DOM quantity and quality along an intermittent stream. We monitored a headwater intermittent stream at high spatial and temporal frequencies during a summer drying episode and analysed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its spectroscopic properties, inorganic solutes and dissolved CO2. The drying period determined the disruption of the fluvial continuum with a recession of stream continuum at a rate of similar to 60 m/d and the gradual formation of a patched system of isolated pools of different sizes. Our results showed that the period of time that had elapsed since isolated pool formation (CI-days) was an essential factor for understanding how drying shaped the biogeochemistry of the fluvial system. Overall, drying caused a high DOC concentration and an increase in the humic-like fluorescence signal. Additionally, solutes showed contrasting responses to hydrological disconnection. Electrical conductivity, for instance, is a clear ""sentinel"" of the fragmentation process because it starts to increase before the hydrological disruption occurs. In contrast, DOC. most spectroscopic DOM descriptors and CO2 showed delayed responses of approximately 5-21 days after the formation of isolated pools. Furthermore, the spatial location and volume of each isolated pool seemed to exert a significant impact on most variables. In contrast, the temperature did not follow a dear pattern. These findings indicate that the fragmentation of longitudinal hydrological connectivity does not induce a single biogeochemical response but rather stimulates a set of solute-specific responses that generates a complex biogeochemical mosaic in a single fluvial unit.

16,"Huang, ZH",Aug 2022 ,The Coupling Coordination Evolutionary Analysis of Tourism-Ecological Environment-Public Service for the Yellow River Basin of China,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"In the context of the global pandemic, the development of tourism in the Yellow River Basin is constrained by the dual mechanisms of the decline in the quality of public service and the deterioration of the ecological environment. In order to promote the high-quality development of the ecological environment in the Yellow River Basin, this paper studies the coordinated development of tourism, the ecological environment and public service in the Yellow River Basin by treating tourism, the ecological environment and public service as a whole. Based on the coupling coordination function GM (1,1) grey prediction method and PVAR model, we discuss the characteristics of spatio-temporal differences, evolutionary trends and the interaction mechanism of the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of tourism-ecological environment-public service in nine provinces along the Yellow River Basin in China from 2008 to 2019. The results show that tourism and public service in the Yellow River Basin are closely related, and the protection of the ecological environment and tourism development are not contradictory. In terms of time, the overall trend is stable and upward from the perspective of the CCD of the three systems; in terms of space, Henan, Shandong, and Sichuan provinces have a relatively high level of CCD. While Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces have a lower level of CCD, which shows an upward trend from upstream to downstream in the space. The evolutionary trend of the CCD of the three systems in the basin will be upward in all provinces except for the Shandong province in the next five years. Tourism can promote both the ecological environment and public service from the perspective of the mutual influence mechanism.Show less"
17,"Argentina, JE",Oct 2018 ,Spatial extent of analysis influences observed patterns of population genetic structure in a widespread darter species (Percidae),FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Connectivity among stream fish populations allows for exchange of genetic material and helps maintain genetic diversity, adaptive potential and population stability over time. Changes in species demographics and population connectivity have the potential to permanently alter the genetic patterns of stream fish, although these changes through space and time are variable and understudied in small-bodied freshwater fish.2. As a spatially widespread, common species of benthic freshwater fish, the variegate darter (Etheostoma variatum) is a model species for documenting how patterns of genetic structure and diversity respond to increasing isolation due to large dams and how scale of study may shape our understanding of these patterns. We sampled variegate darters from 34 sites across their range in the North American Ohio River basin and examined how patterns of genetic structure and diversity within and between populations responded to historical population changes and dams within and between populations.3. Spatial scale and configuration of genetic structure varied across the eight identified populations, from tributaries within a watershed, to a single watershed, to multiple watersheds that encompass Ohio River mainstem habitats. This multiwatershed pattern of population structuring suggests genetic dispersal across large distances was and may continue to be common, although some populations remain isolated despite no apparent structural dispersal barriers. Populations with low effective population sizes and evidence of past population bottlenecks showed low allelic richness, but diversity patterns were not related to watershed size, a surrogate for habitat availability. Pairwise genetic differentiation (F-ST) increased with fluvial distance and was related to both historic and contemporary processes. Genetic diversity changes were influenced by underlying population size and stability, and while instream barriers were not strong determinants of genetic structuring or loss of genetic diversity, they reduce population connectivity and may impact long-term population persistence.4. The broad spatial scale of this study demonstrated the large spatial extent of some variegate darter populations and indicated that dispersal is more extensive than expected given the movement patterns typically observed for small-bodied, benthic fish. Dam impacts depended on underlying population size and stability, with larger populations more resilient to genetic drift and allelic richness loss than smaller populations.5. Other darters that inhabit large river habitats may show similar patterns in landscape-scale studies, and large river barriers may impact populations of small-bodied fish more than previously expected. Estimation of dispersal rates and behaviours is critical to conservation of imperilled riverine species such as darters.Show less"
18,"Lasne, E",Sep 2015 ,The Effects of DAM Removal on River Colonization by Sea Lamprey Petromyzon Marinus,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Habitat fragmentation is an important cause of biodiversity loss in freshwater systems, as worldwide rivers have been fragmented by dams and other hydraulic structures. To restore freshwater fish populations, some barriers have been removed, but the long-term ecological effects of this removal have been rarely quantified. In the present study, we quantified the effects of barrier removal on river colonization by anadromous sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) by analyzing the spatial distribution and nest density in a small coastal river (France) from 1994 to 2011. Our results demonstrated the benefit of dam removal within few years after restoration. Indeed, the spatial distribution of nests shifted significantly upstream and was more uniform throughout the river after removal. Our results also suggest that the spatial patterns of habitat colonization were affected by the density of nests, river flow and connectivity. Finally, although the number of nests was significantly higher after removal, it was not possible to clearly identify the contribution of intrinsic versus external factors involved in this pattern. Further investigations are therefore needed to quantify the potential subsequent effects on juvenile recruitment and the overall population dynamics.

19,"Xu, YJ",Oct 2018 ,Assessing Resilience and Sustainability of the Mississippi River Delta as a Coupled Natural-Human System,WATER,"This book contains 14 articles selected from a special issue on the assessment of resilience and sustainability of the Mississippi River Delta as a coupled natural-human system. This effort is supported in part by a U. S. National Science Foundation grant. The goal of this book is to present some of the recent advances in research and research methodologies, major discoveries, and new understanding of the Mississippi River Delta, which represents one of the most challenging cases in finding the pathways for coastal resilience and sustainability because of the complexity of environmental and socioeconomic interactions. The articles are contributed by 39 researchers and they studied the deltaic system from five aspects including 1) riverine processes and sediment availability, 2) sediment deposition and land creation, 3) wetland loss, saltwater intrusion, and subsidence, 4) community resilience and planning, and 5) review and synthesis. As editors, by reviewing and putting these papers together, we have realized a major challenge in conducting an interdisciplinary assessment of resilience: How to identify a ""Common Threshold"" from different scientific disciplines for a highly nature-human intertwined river delta system? For instance, the threshold for sustaining a river delta in the view of physical sciences is different from that of social sciences. Such a common threshold would be a radical change and/or a collapse of a coupled natural-human delta system if nothing can be or will be done. Identifying the common threshold would help guide assessment and evaluation of the resilience of a CNH system as well as the feasibility and willingness of protecting the system's resilience. We hope this book will be a first step toward inspiring researchers from different disciplines to work closely together to solve real problems in sustaining precious river delta ecosystems across the globe.Show less"
20,"Gregory, MD",Dec 2019 ,Williams syndrome hemideletion and LIMK1 variation both affect dorsal stream functional connectivity,BRAIN,"Williams syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by hemizygous deletion of similar to 1.6 Mb affecting 26 genes on chromosome 7 (7q11.23) and is clinically typified by two cognitive/behavioural hallmarks: marked visuospatial deficits relative to verbal and nonverbal reasoning abilities and hypersocial personality. Clear knowledge of the circumscribed set of genes that are affected in Williams syndrome, along with the well-characterized neurobehavioural phenotype, offers the potential to elucidate neurogenetic principles that may apply in genetically and clinically more complex settings. The intraparietal sulcus, in the dorsal visual processing stream, has been shown to be structurally and functionally altered in Williams syndrome, providing a target for investigating resting-state functional connectivity and effects of specific genes hemideleted in Williams syndrome. Here, we tested for effects of the LIMK1 gene, deleted in Williams syndrome and important for neuronal maturation and migration, on intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity. We first defined a target brain phenotype by comparing intraparietal sulcus resting functional connectivity in individuals with Williams syndrome, in whom LIMK1 is hemideleted, with typically developing children. Then in two separate cohorts from the general population, we asked whether intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity patterns similar to those found in Williams syndrome were associated with sequence variation of the LIMK1 gene. Four independent between-group comparisons of resting-state functional MRI data (total n = 510) were performed: (i) 20 children with Williams syndrome compared to 20 age- and sex-matched typically developing children; (ii) a discovery cohort of 99 healthy adults stratified by LIMK1 haplotype; (iii) a replication cohort of 32 healthy adults also stratified by LIMK1 haplotype; and (iv) 339 healthy adolescent children stratified by LIMK1 haplotype. For between-group analyses, differences in intraparietal sulcus resting-state functional connectivity were calculated comparing children with Williams syndrome to matched typically developing children and comparing LIMK1 haplotype groups in each of the three general population cohorts separately. Consistent with the visuospatial construction impairment and hypersocial personality that typify Williams syndrome, the Williams syndrome cohort exhibited opposite patterns of intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity with visual processing regions and social processing regions: decreased circuit function in the former and increased circuit function in the latter. All three general population groups also showed LIMK1 haplotype-related differences in intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity localized to the fusiform gyrus, a visual processing region also identified in the Williams syndrome-typically developing comparison. These results suggest a neurogenetic mechanism, in part involving LIMK1, that may bias neural circuit function in both the general population and individuals with Williams syndrome.Show less"
21,"Schopper, N",Mar 25 2019 ,Analysis of lateral sediment connectivity and its connection to debris flow intensity patterns at different return periods in the Fella River system in northeastern Italy,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"A wide variety of issues are now being addressed using the concept of connectivity, which has initiated the development of various methods to assess a river's relationship to its catchment. This study tests two well established methods, the Effective Catchment Area (ECA) and the Index of Connectivity (IC) in the study area of the Fella River in northeastern Italy, to gain an idea of their potentials, limitations and ability to represent connectivity patterns observable in the field. The results show that both methods provide largely agreeing outputs, which widely match field observations. Disagreement is mainly found where human-induced features, especially roads, encroach the rivers system. Focusing on a natural hazard background, the study furthermore approaches the issue of events of different frequencies and magnitudes and their representation in terms of connectivity. This is done by correlating debris flows at varying return periods with the IC, which seemed more fitting for this comparison due to the differentiation between different intensities of connectivity. Over the entire catchment, patterns of debris flow intensities (DFI) only agree weakly with the patterns of the IC, however, debris flows reaching the main channel show strong correlations with IC values. This can be traced back to the fact that connectivity focuses on a catchment's relationship with the river anti does not include processes that happen in those parts of the catchment not directly linked to the main channel network. The IC is therefore able to represent patterns of processes reaching the main valley very well but cannot be used to explain or even predict the occurrence of processes that have no direct spatial connection to the river.

22,"Anibas, C",May 2018 ,"Delineation of spatial-temporal patterns of groundwater/surface-water interaction along a river reach (Aa River, Belgium) with transient thermal modeling",HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Among the advances made in analytical and numerical analysis methods to quantify groundwater/surface-water interaction, one methodology that stands out is the use of heat as an environmental tracer. A large data set of river and riverbed temperature profiles from the Aa River in Belgium has been used to examine the spatial-temporal variations of groundwater/surface-water interaction. Exchange fluxes were calculated with the numerical heat-transport code STRIVE. The code was applied in transient mode to overcome previous limitations of steady-state analysis, and allowed for the calculation of model quality. In autumn and winter the mean exchange fluxes reached -90 mm d(-1), while in spring and early summer fluxes were -42 mm d(-1). Predominantly gaining conditions occurred along the river reach; however, in a few areas the direction of flow changed in time. The river banks showed elevated fluxes up to a factor of 3 compared to the center of the river. Higher fluxes were detected in the upstream section of the reach. Due to the influence of exchange fluxes along the river banks, larger temporal variations were found in the downstream section. The exchange fluxes at the river banks seemed more driven by variable local exchange flows, while the center of the river was dominated by deep and steady regional groundwater flows. These spatial and temporal differences in groundwater/surface-water exchange show the importance of long-term investigations on the driving forces of hyporheic processes across different scales.Show less"
23,"Meier, W",Aug 2003 ,Modeling the effect of water diversion on the temperature of mountain streams,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Water diversion for hydroelectric power generation impacts the temperature of mountain streams. Such changes are estimated by using a coupled one-dimensional dead-zone heat balance model. In very steep river sections, the dissipation of kinetic energy is the dominant heat source. For such streams, water diversion has only a minor effect on water temperature, because dissipation-induced temperature changes are independent of discharge. In contrast, in river sections of gradual slope, the influence by solar radiation, long-wave radiation. and heat exchange with the streambed is stronger. In such cases, a discharge reduction can lead to significant temperature changes. For a small stream in the southern Swiss Alps, model results show that diversion increases temperature by about 3.7 (+/-0.9)degreesC in a 21 km long river section under high solar radiation during summer. During a cold winter episode, water temperature is estimated to be about 1.8 (+/-0.8)degreesC lower compared to natural conditions. This heat balance model can also be used to simulate the effect of different measures to reduce water temperature changes in affected streams.Show less"
24,"Miranda, LE",Nov 2005 ,Fish assemblages in oxbow lakes relative to connectivity with the Mississippi River,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,"The alluvial valley of the lower Mississippi River contains hundreds of fluvial lakes that are periodically connected to the river during high water, although the frequency, duration, and timing of the connections vary. To help design plans to restore and preserve fish assemblages in these alluvial lakes, this investigation tested whether predictable patterns in lake fish assemblages were linked to the level of connectivity with the river. Results suggested that connectivity played an important role in structuring fish assemblages and that it was correlated with variables such as lake size, depth, distance from the river, and age, which exhibit a continuum of predictable features as the river migrates away from abandoned channels. Annual floods homogenize the floodplain and promote connectivity to various degrees, allowing for fish exchanges between river and floodplain that directly affect fish assemblages. The major physical changes linked to reduced connectivity are loss of depth and area, which in turn affect a multiplicity of abiotic and biotic features that indirectly affect community structure. In advanced stages of disconnection, fish assemblages in oxbow lakes are expected to include largely species that thrive in turbid, shallow systems with few predators and low oxygen content. When the river flowed without artificial restraint, oxbow lakes were created at the rate of 13-15 per century. At present, no or few oxbow lakes are being formed, and as existing lakes age, they are becoming shallower, smaller, and progressively more disconnected from the river. Given that modifications to the Mississippi River appear to be irreversible, conservation of this resource requires maintenance of existing lakes at a wide range of aging phases that provide diverse habitats and harbor distinct species assemblages.Show less"

By strongly influencing sediment supply regime, such inputs control the dynamics and characteristics of the channel as well as the associated habitat and biota. The main objective of this research was to disentangle the relative importance of geomorphic and biological factors which define spatial patterns in lateral connectivity by promoting or restricting bank erosion, avulsions, and slope failures. Focusing on a forested, formerly glaciated mountain basin in the interior Pacific Northwest, wecombined extensive field surveys with remote sensing data (LiDAR, aerial imagery) to obtainmetrics representing this complex suite of landscape characteristics. The interpretation of evidence yielded by correlations between these variables, a regime model, and qualitative observations, suggest that, at a multi-decadal timescale between major landscape disturbances, lateral connectivity patterns in Sullivan Creek may be, to a large extent, governed by a combination of biotic factors and glacial legacies. In particular, forest canopy metrics were key predictors of hillslope stability as well as bank and valley floor resistance, suggesting a pivotal influence of root reinforcement. On the other hand, instream large wood abundance was closely related to channel splitting, which reflects its role in promoting channel avulsions. More extensive bank erosion in reaches dominated by drift deposits appeared to indicate glacial legacies. Furthermore, a strong association between bank erosion and colluvial inputs suggested a close coupling within the channel-hillslope system. Lateral confinement - defined as the proportion of the channel length abutting against bedrock, terraces, fans and roads - was negatively associated with channel braiding; the relationships linking confinement with bank erosion and the magnitude of colluvial inputs (negative and positive association, respectively) were relatively weak. Taken together, findings emerging from this research suggest that better understanding of lateral geomorphic connectivity patterns in mountain river basins similar to our study site requires that both channel processes and broader, biophysical landscape system be considered.

Observing exchange flow behavior in heterogeneous systems is a primary challenge, particularly when flows are governed by dynamic river stage or tidal variations. In this paper we demonstrate a novel application of time-lapse 3D electrical resistivity tomography and temperature monitoring where an array of thermistors installed beneath a riverbed double as resistivity electrodes. We use the array to monitor stage driven exchange flows over a 6-day period in a dynamic, stage-driven high order stream. We present a method for addressing the otherwise confounding effects of the moving river-surface boundary on the raw resistivity data, thereby enabling successful tomographic imaging. Temperature time-series at each thermistor location and time-lapse 3D images of changes in bulk electrical conductivity together provide a detailed description of exchange dynamics over a 10-meter by 45-meter section of the riverbed, to a depth of approximately 5 m. Results reveal highly variable flux behavior throughout the monitoring domain including both horizontal and vertical exchange flows.Show less"
29,"Fryirs, K",Jun 2009 ,Naturalness and Place in River Rehabilitation,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,"An authentic approach to river rehabilitation emphasizes concerns for the natural values of a given place. As landscape considerations fashion the physical template upon which biotic associations take place, various geomorphic issues must be addressed in framing rehabilitation activities that strive to improve river health. An open-ended approach to river classification promotes applications that appreciate the values of a given river, rather than pigeonholing reality. As the geomorphic structure of some rivers is naturally simple, promoting heterogeneity as a basis for management may not always be appropriate. Efforts to protect unique attributes of river systems must be balanced with procedures that look after common features. Concerns for ecosystem functionality must relate to the behavioral regime of a given river, remembering that some rivers are inherently sensitive to disturbance. Responses to human disturbance must be viewed in relation to natural variability, recognizing how spatial relationships in a catchment, and responses to past disturbances, fashion the operation of contemporary fluxes. These fluxes, in turn, influence what is achievable in the rehabilitation of a given reach. Given the inherently adjusting and evolutionary nature of river systems, notional endpoints do not provide an appropriate basis upon which to promote concepts of naturalness and place in the rehabilitation process. These themes are drawn together to promote rehabilitation practices that relate to the natural values of each river system, in preference to applications of ""cookbook"" measures that build upon textbook geomorphology.Show less"
30,"Macdonald, DM",Nov 2018 ,Water and nitrate exchange between a managed river and peri-urban floodplain aquifer: Quantification and management implications,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"The management of rivers for navigation, hydropower and flood risk reduction involves the installation of in-channel structures. These influence river levels and can affect groundwater flow within hydraulically-connected riparian floodplain aquifers. A comprehensively monitored, peri-urban, lowland river floodplain in the southern United Kingdom was used to explore these dependencies and to examine the implications for the flux exchange of water and nitrate between the river and the floodplain alluvial aquifer. The study demonstrated that rivers maintained at high levels by management structures, result in raised groundwater levels in the adjacent aquifer and complex groundwater flow patterns. Engineered river management structures were shown to promote flow from river to aquifer through the river bed but the majority of the associated nitrate was removed in the hyporheic zone. High-nitrate groundwater recharge to the alluvial aquifer also occurred through overbank flood flows. Across the floodplain, substantial denitrification occurred due to anaerobic conditions resulting from carbon-rich sediments and the shallow water table, the latter linked to the river management structures. An upper limit on the total annual mass of nitrate removed from river water entering the floodplain aquifer was estimated for the study site (2.9 x 10(4) kg), which was three orders of magnitude lower than the estimate of annual in-channel nitrate flux (1.8 x 10(7) kg). However, this capacity of lowland floodplains to reduce groundwater nitrate concentrations has local benefits, for example for private and public water supplies sourced from alluvial aquifers. The insights from the study also have relevance for those considering schemes that include the installation, removal or redesign of river management structures, as the resultant change in groundwater levels may have consequences for floodplain meadows and the nutrient status of the aquatic system.Show less"
31,"Dou, P",Dec 2020 ,A Network Perspective to Evaluate Hydrological Connectivity Effects on Macroinvertebrate Assemblages,WETLANDS,"The abundant estuarine wetlands supported by the complex river network in the Pearl River Delta are under intense anthropogenic influence, which threatens the local ecosystem. This paper examines the benthic macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance within the Pearl River Estuary through a field study. Fieldwork, based on the integral index of connectivity (IIC) of the wetland network, was carried out in the Pearl River Estuary. The responses of macroinvertebrate metrics to the integral connectivity gradient in the wetland network were examined. Statistical analyses (CCA) revealed that the benthic abundance in high-hydrological-connectivity riverine habitats was clearly distinct from that in low-connectivity habitats. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the diversity and abundance of the macrobenthos populations were determined by the integral connectivity of the wetland network. A non-linear model was developed to depict the relationship between macroinvertebrate diversity and network connectivity. Thus, conservation efforts in estuarine wetlands should focus on the macroinvertebrate diversity response in wetland patches with specific connectivity characteristics in the wetland network of the Pearl River Delta.Show less"
32,"Yu, X",Oct 7 2022 ,Study on coupling coordination of the human settlement environment and tourism industry in the yellow river basin,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"The human settlement environment is the basic space where people live, produce and live. The tourism industry is one of the industries closest to the development goal of the human settlement environment. The coordinated development of the human settlement environment and the tourism industry provides vital support for high-quality sustainable development in the region, but the related research is relatively insufficient. Based on the panel data from 2010 to 2019, this study takes the Yellow Basin as the research object, using comprehensive evaluation, coupling degree, and coupling coordination models. The study aims to comprehensively measure the development level of the human settlement environment and tourism industry in nine provinces of the Yellow River Basin and analyzes the spatio-temporal differentiation characteristics of the coupling coordination between the human settlement environment and tourism industry in the Yellow River Basin. The results demonstrate an interactive coupling relationship between the human settlement environment and the tourism industry. We observe an upward fluctuation in the development level of the two systems in the Yellow River Basin and converging development trends between the two; however, the tourism industry in the region is far behind in driving the construction of the human settlement environment. Regarding the spatial and temporal evolution of the coupling coordination of the two systems, in the time dimension, the coupling degree of the nine provinces in the Yellow River Basin was relatively stable from 2010 to 2019 and maintained a high level. The coupling coordination degree was on the rise, evolving from near-disorder to elementary coordination. The two systems in the Basin still showed a pattern of ""high coupling-low coordination. "" Nevertheless, in the spatial dimension, the coupling and coupling coordination degrees of the two systems in the Yellow River Basin showed an unbalanced development pattern of ""high in the southeast and low in the northwest. "" The regions with a low coordination level demonstrated that the development of the tourism industry lags behind in the construction of the human settlement environment. Findings in this study provide references for increasing the resonance between the human settlement environment and the tourism industry and promoting the overall coordinated, balanced and sustainable development of the Yellow River Basin.Show less"

This paper focuses on the Olse River in the Czech part of the Flysch Carpathians and summarises the results of the increased kinetic energy of flowing water of contemporary channel based on the analyse of hydraulic parameters of channel. The comparison of geodetic measurements from 1960 and 2003 was used together with the assessment of aerial photos from 1950s and present. The average width of the studied reach of the active Olse R. channel narrowed from 35 m in 1955 to 24 m in 2010. In some locations, the original river bed has lowered as much as 2.3 m between the years 1960 and 2003. Morphology of the Olse River channel has accelerated these erosion processes. The main reason for this is an adjustment of water flow dynamics. The unit stream power and hydraulic radius values have increased two to three times from 1960 to 2003 for 5, 20, 50 and 100-recurrence interval discharge. Incision of channel greater than 0.10-0.21m in the studied period may reflect change in cross-sectional geometry and lower than 0.10-0.21m may reflect other factors such as sediment disruption operating in the basin (e.g. with land-use changes, gravel mining etc.).Show less"

The viability of eggs depends on many factors, particularly their oxygenation. Because dissolved oxygen is typically saturated within the stream channel, the dissolved oxygen distribution within the redd depends on whether or not hyporheic flow and transport occur within the sediment. We conducted a series of flume and numerical flow and age transport modeling experiments with the aim of understanding the effects of salmonid redds on the hyporheic transport of young oxygenated water. Hyporheic flow was visualized directly through dye injections. Dissolved oxygen throughout the fish nest was measured using a planar optode. Experiments were conducted at various open channel flow velocities in order to understand their effect on dissolved oxygen, and computational simulations considered various sediment textures and ambient groundwater upwelling rates to add process-level insight. We found that, as also shown by previous studies, the redd topography induces multiscale hyporheic flow that effectively flushes the egg pocket location with younger presumably oxygenated water; older water upwells and forms anoxic zones. This pattern persists even at the lowest channel flow rates and at small upwelling velocities of older ambient groundwater which splits the multiscale hyporheic flow cells into isolated pockets. Large groundwater upwelling rates can shut down all the hyporheic flushing. The relatively coarse texture of the redd further promotes hyporheic flushing of the redd sediment with oxygenated water. Thus, redd morphology and sediment texture optimally combine to induce hyporheic exchange flow that delivers young oxygenated water to the egg pocket.Show less"

Here we applied a spatially explicit, three-dimensional hydrologic model to simulate surface and subsurface flow within the 16-km(2) Nyack Floodplain on the Middle Fork Flathead River in northwest Montana, USA. We ran the model for four years and simulated nine conservative particle releases across a range of river discharges. Our objective was to evaluate the interactions of hydrologic dynamics and floodplain structure in determining the residence time of water in the system. Particle tracking simulations revealed when river discharge was below bankfull, mean residence time of surface water decreased with river discharge. During overbank flows, however, mean residence time increased with discharge because of surface water storage on the floodplain. When surface and subsurface water were considered, mean hydrologic residence time was more than an order of magnitude greater than the residence time of surface water alone because of storage in the alluvial aquifer. Residence time also decreased exponentially with river discharge, because a smaller percentage of surface water entered the subsurface at high discharges. Our analyses illustrate the importance of considering in-channel flow, floodwater storage, and surface-subsurface exchange in determining the overall residence time of water within a river segment, especially in floodplain environments.

36,"Habberfield, MW",Aug 2014 ,RAPID GEOMORPHIC AND HABITAT STREAM ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES INFORM RESTORATION DIFFERENTLY BASED ON LEVELS OF STREAM DISTURBANCE,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Visual-based rapid assessment techniques provide an efficient method for characterizing the restoration potential of streams, with many focusing on channel stability and instream habitat features. Few studies, however, have compared these techniques to see if they result in differing restoration priorities. Three rapid assessment techniques were contrasted at three wild trout streams in western New York with different amounts of channel disturbance. Two methods focused only on geomorphic stability, whereas the third addressed physical habitat condition. Habitat assessment scores were not correlated with scores for either geomorphic assessment method and they varied more between channels with different degrees of disturbance. A model based on dynamic equilibrium concepts best explains the variation among the streams and techniques because it accounts for a stream's capacity to maintain ecological integrity despite some inherent instability. Geomorphic indices can serve as effective proxies for biological indices in highly disturbed systems. Yet, this may not be the case in less disturbed systems, where geomorphic indices cannot differentiate channel adjustments that impact biota from those that do not. Dynamically stable streams can include both stable and unstable reaches locally as characterized by geomorphic methods and translating these results into restoration priorities may not be appropriate if interpretations are limited to the reach scale.Show less"

In this study, the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and Darcian flux in a submerged streambed and its adjacent exposed stream banks were investigated in the Beiluo River, northwest China. In the submerged streambed, Darcian flux was estimated by measurement of vertical hydraulic conductivity (K (v)) and vertical head gradient (VHG) using in-situ permeameter tests. On exposed stream banks, both horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K (h)) and K (v) were measured by on-site permeameter tests. In the submerged streambed, K (v) values gradually decreased with depth and the higher values were concentrated in the center and close to the erosional bank. Compared to the exposed stream banks, the K (v) values were higher in the streambed. From stream stage to the topmost layer of tested sediment, through increasing elevation, the K (h) values increased on the erosional bank, while they decreased on the depositional bank. The values of VHG along the thalweg illustrate that downwelling flux occurred in the deepest area while upwelling flux appeared in the other areas, which might result from the change of streambed elevation. The higher value of the Darcian flux in the submerged streambed existed near the erosional bank.Show less"
38,"Woessner, WW",May-jun 2000 ,Stream and fluvial plain ground water interactions: Rescaling hydrogeologic thought,GROUND WATER,"Management of near-channel ground water and surface water to maintain stream health and floodplain ecological function requires hydrogeologists to refocus their conceptual models of water exchange between the aquifer and stream. The high hydraulic conductivity fluvial plain directs ground water flow down-plain where it exchanges with the stream channel creating gaining, losing, flow-through, and parallel-flow reaches. The resulting complex flow system requires consideration when profiles representing ground water flowpaths are constructed. In addition to interaction at the scale of the fluvial plain, exchange of ground mater and surface water within and immediately adjacent to the stream channel creates hyporheic zones. The physical and biogeochemical extent of these zones depends on the head distribution and ground water flow directions, stream hydraulics, and channel bed conditions, and magnitudes and distributions of hydrogeologic parameters. Simulated conceptualizations of flow dynamics caused by slight increases in hydraulic potentials at the surface water-stream bed interface indicate stream-ground water mixing could occur to a depth of 1.7 m below the channel. Rescaling of traditional hydrogeologic approaches to include the fluvial plain and channel scale will result in opportunities to expand hydrogeologic research and participate in interdisciplinary research teams attempting to decipher and manage fluvial systems.Show less"

In this paper, a new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity evaluation index system is established to evaluate the new urbanization level and ecological carrying capacity of the Yellow River Basin. On this basis, the uncoordinated coupling level of new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity in the Yellow River Basin is measured by using the improved uncoordinated coupling model, and its temporal and spatial characteristics and internal impact mechanism are analyzed. The study shows that the new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity of the Yellow River Basin has a benign development trend as a whole. Shandong province belongs to the low-level uncoordinated coupling type; Gansu Province and Qinghai Province belong to the running-in uncoordinated type; and Shanxi Province, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shaanxi Province, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region belong to the antagonistic uncoordinated coupling type. The uncoordinated coupling degree between new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity in the Yellow River Basin has a spatial interaction effect. It presents a low-level cluster centered on Shaanxi Province and Shandong Province and a high-level cluster centered on Gansu Province, Qinghai Province, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. From the perspective of the internal main impact mechanism, water resources have a two-way impact on the development of the two systems of new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity; the number of permanent residents and the level of scientific and technological investment have a one-way impact on the process of new urbanization; and the green coverage rate of built-up areas has a one-way impact on the development of ecological carrying capacity. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the evaluation index system of new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity has been improved in combination with the new development concept. The evaluation of new urbanization by this index system is more in line with the current national requirements for high-quality development. Second, the impact of potential resources and human regulation has been added to the traditional ecological carrying capacity evaluation index system, and the evaluation of ecological carrying capacity by this index system is more in line with reality. Thirdly, taking the time effect into account, an improved uncoordinated coupling method is proposed. Using this method to evaluate the relationship between systems is conducive to bringing the dynamic relationship within the system into the evaluation system, which is more in line with the reality of system changes. Fourth, from the perspective of problem diagnosis, research on the relationship between new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity will help to find the internal mechanism that affects the coordinated development of new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity in the Yellow River Basin. This method is universal for exploring the internal influence mechanism of the relationship between systems.Show less"

Repeat DEM analysis provides a means of assessing transfer of sediment supplied from the Tarndale gully through the fan to the Te Weraroa Stream and thus inferring connectivity between these landscape components from which a conceptual coupling model is derived. Analysis indicates the operation of two critical junction switches at the (i) gully-fan and (ii) fan-stream nexus, which contribute to considerable complexity in patterns of erosion and deposition on the fan as it responds to sediment supply or starvation from the Tarndale gully and evacuation to the Te Weraroa Stream (described in Fuller and Marden, 2010). The fan does not respond as a coherent unit. Each of six fan feeder tributaries behaves independently according to sediment supplied from six discrete source areas within the gully complex. This reflects sediment production within specific activity zones of Tarndale Gully. Mass movements, triggered by single rainstorm events and/or wet periods contingent upon sediment availability and intrinsic slope mechanics, frequently deliver sediment to the upper fan tributaries. This enhanced gully-fan coupling during storms or wetter periods promotes rapid fan aggradation, with each feeder tributary responding to its discrete source zone. Infilling may propagate down fan in response to upper fan incision once the gully-fan switch deactivates, transferring sediment as far as the Te Weraroa Stream, coupling the fan with the stream system. Floods generated in the Te Weraroa Stream may also activate the junction switch at the fan-stream nexus by trimming the lower fan, prompting up-fan incision via head-cutting in response to changed local base level. Slope-channel coupling in this environment is a function of a range of slope and channel processes responding to discrete storms and intrinsic gully dynamics. The high rates of geomorphic activity in this environment mean the Tarndale system provides a natural laboratory in which to assess key slope-channel coupling processes beyond the plot or discrete event scale.

This research is one of the first attempts to collect and assess DOC conditions at the SGI across a stream network-an entire third-order, lowland watershed in Michigan, USA. We present an initial exploration of this unique data set and highlight some of the challenges when working at these scales. Overall, our results show that SGI DOC conditions are complex at the network scale and do not conform to predictions based upon previous point- and small-scale studies. We found no strong pattern of DOC removal within the SGI at the network scale even after using chloride and temperature as natural tracers to differentiate between hydrological processes and biogeochemical reactions influencing DOC cycling. Instead, trends in DOC quantity and molecular qualities suggest that potential biotic reactions, including aerobic microbial respiration, had an influence on DOC concentrations at only some of the sites, while physical mixing of ground and stream surface waters appears to explain the majority of the observed changes in DOC concentrations at other sites. In addition, results show that neither SGI sites indicating DOC removal nor DOC molecular quality shifts measured correlated with stream order. It did reveal that DOC variability across surface water, groundwater, and the SGI locations was consistently greatest in the shallow sediments of the SGI, demonstrating that the SGI is a systematically distinct location for DOC conditions in the watershed. Our empirical stream network-scale SGI data are some of the first that are compatible with recently developed process-based, network-scale, SGI models. Our results indicate that these process-based models may not accurately represent SGI exchange of lowland, groundwater discharge-dominated streams like the one in this study. Lastly, this study shows that new methods are needed to achieve the goal of making and linking SGI observations to network-scale biogeochemical processes and theory. To help develop these methods we provide a discussion of the approach we used (i.e., ""lessons-learned"") that might become the basis for systematic data analysis of SGI porewaters in future, network-wide biogeochemical studies of the SGI.Show less"

Hydrological connectivity frameworks provide a new perspective to study both hydrological behavior and the relationship between hydrological and ecological processes. Although some indices have been developed to parameterize hydrological connectivity structure (HCS) in different environments, the indices only consider soil water content (SWC) or topography and are limited in some specific areas. Due to its importance to understand ecological-hydrological interaction and wetland conservation and restoration. There is still a necessity to develop indices to capture hydrological attributes. In the current study, we collected soil-hydrological data in the Yellow River Delta and three indices, main flow direction (TM) based on topography, over field capacity index (OFCI) based on SWC, and topographic over field capacity index (TOFCI) based on both topography and SWC are developed using graph theory. The results show OFCI in a semi-artificial pond is significantly higher than in intertidal flats, tidal marshes and riverside wetlands, and TOFCI values in four wetland types differ significantly. TM does not show statistical differences for wetland types explored. According to the parameterized values, the semi-artificial pond has the strongest HCS, followed by intertidal flats. Tidal marshes and riverside wetlands have the weakest HCS. The landscapes of different wetland types are related to the HCS on the surface soil layer, and four wetland types in the Yellow River Delta can be distinguished by TOFCI values. The results also indicate that TOFCI can be used to locate degraded wetland areas for restoration, however more specific relationships between HCS indices and ecological structure are desirable in the future.

44,"Anderson, KE",Aug 2006 ,Instream flow needs in streams and rivers: the importance of understanding ecological dynamics,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,"Resource managers have traditionally had to rely on simple hydrological and habitat-association methods to predict how changes in river flow regimes will affect the viability of instream populations and communities. Yet these systems are characterized by dynamic feedbacks among system components, a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, and connectivity between habitats, none of which can be adequately captured in the commonly employed management methods. We argue that process-oriented ecological models, which consider dynamics across scales and levels of biological organization, are better suited to guide flow regime management. We review how ecological dynamics in streams and rivers are shaped by a combination of the flow regime and internal feedbacks, and proceed to describe ecological modeling tools that have the potential to characterize such dynamics. We conclude with a suggested research agenda to facilitate the inclusion of ecological dynamics into instream flow needs assessments.Show less"

In many systems, distinguishing between watershed and stream ecosystem controls can be challenging. The usefulness of such monitoring can be enhanced by the application of quantitative models to interpret observed patterns in real time. Examples are discussed primarily from the glacial meltwater streams of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Although the Dry Valley landscape is barren of plants, many streams harbor thriving cyanobacterial mats. Whereas a daily cycle of streamflow is controlled by the surface energy balance on the glaciers and the temporal pattern of solar exposure, the daily signal for biogeochemical processes controlling water quality is generated along the stream. These features result in an excellent outdoor laboratory for investigating fundamental ecosystem process and the development and validation of process-based models. As part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research project, we have conducted field experiments and developed coupled biogeochemical transport models for the role of hyporheic exchange in controlling weathering reactions, microbial nitrogen cycling, and stream temperature regulation. We have adapted modeling approaches from sediment transport to understand mobilization of stream biomass with increasing flows. These models help to elucidate the role of in-stream processes in systems where watershed processes also contribute to observed patterns, and may serve as a test case for applying real-time stream ecosystem models.Show less"

To examine the effects of hydrological exchange between groundwater and surface water on the distribution of aquatic invertebrates within a riverine landscape, we investigated the main stem, tributaries, and various surface and subsurface waters of two floodplains of a southern Alpine river (Brenno, Switzerland) in terms of their physicochemical, hydraulic, substratum, and faunal characteristics. The origins of the water were investigated by analyzing geomorphic settings and physicochemical variables. The two floodplains had different hydrological regimes. The middle floodplain was dominated by lateral inputs and exfiltration of hillslope groundwater from two different subcatchments. Bank filtration of river water sustained subsurface water only close to the channel. The aquatic habitats of the middle floodplain formed a rather homogeneous group with high taxon richness and intrahabitat diversities. These aquatic habitats resembled mountain springbrooks in their physicochemical characteristics and faunal compositions. In the lower floodplain, the exchange between river water and groundwater was more extensive. The aquatic floodplain habitats of the lower floodplain were fed mainly by deep and shallow alluvial groundwater, hyporheic exfiltration, and partly by surface water. In contrast to aquatic habitats of the middle floodplain, habitats of the lower floodplain showed a low intrahabitat and a high interhabitat diversity in terms of both substrate characteristics and faunal compositions. For both floodplains, ordination analyses showed a high concordance between the structure of the invertebrate community and the characteristics of the environmental habitat, including chemical, geomorphic, and hydraulic variables. Ordinations grouped aquatic habitats according to the origins of the waters. Taxon richness was related to local structural diversity, but species turnover was related to differential vertical and lateral connectivity. Exfiltration of groundwaters provided aquatic floodplain habitats for several specialized species. The results of this study show the significance of the river-groundwater connectivity for the creation of the habitat mosaic that sustains biodiversity in floodplains and thus have important implications for managing the ecological integrity of floodplains.Show less"
47,"Thomas, DA",Jun 2006 ,A comparison of fish community composition of headwater and adventitious streams in a coldwater river system,JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,"The river continuum concept is an overarching paradigm in stream ecology, but the concept makes no provision for adventitious streams (i.e., low-ordered tributaries to larger rivers). We examined the fish community and habitat of the fifth-order mainstem, two second-order adventitious tributaries to the mainstem, and three second-order headwater streams of the Pine River (Alcona County, Michigan) from May through August 2000. Fish species richness generally increased with increasing stream order and was higher in the adventitious streams than in the headwater streams. The fish species composition of adventitious streams was more similar to the mainstem than to the headwater streams but showed greater month-to-month variability than either the mainstem or headwater streams. Habitat conditions in headwater and adventitious streams were similar except adventitious streams were generally warmer. These results indicate that factors in addition to stream order, such as stream connectivity and temperature, are important determinants of stream fish assemblage.Show less"
48,"Duraes, L",Aug 24 2016 ,Simulating the role of connectivity in shaping stream insect metacommunities under colonization cycle dynamics,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"We simulated metacommunities in a hypothetical riverine network to investigate whether and how connectivity affects the species richness of groups with different dispersal abilities under different niche and dispersal-assembly rules. The simulated network was represented by a graph in which the nodes represented habitat patches, each with a particular environmental condition. We built our model based on Muller's ""colonization cycle"" hypothesis, in which adult aquatic insects compensate for the gradual downstream movement of larvae by flying preferentially upstream to oviposition. Species occurrence in each patch was probabilistically determined, taking into account environmental filtering and/or dispersal ability in different assembly scenarios. Variation in local species richness was explained by connectivity in both assembly scenarios, especially when dispersal ability was weak. In niche assembly metacommunities, the effect of connectivity was also dependent on the location of preferable patches. In general, local species richness was higher when dispersal ability was strong. Our findings suggest that the role of connectivity in shaping riverine metacommunities is context dependent and that the spatial structure of riverine networks should be considered in monitoring freshwater biota.

49,"Alexander, RB",Feb 2007 ,The role of headwater streams in downstream water quality,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Knowledge of headwater influences on the water-quality and flow conditions of downstream waters is essential to water-resource management at all governmental levels; this includes recent court decisions on the jurisdiction of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) over upland areas that contribute to larger downstream water bodies. We review current watershed research and use a water-quality model to investigate headwater influences on downstream receiving waters. Our evaluations demonstrate the intrinsic connections of headwaters to landscape processes and downstream waters through their influence on the supply, transport, and fate of water and solutes in watersheds. Hydrological processes in headwater catchments control the recharge of subsurface water stores, flow paths, and residence times of water throughout landscapes. The dynamic coupling of hydrological and biogeochemical. processes in upland streams further controls the chemical form, timing, and longitudinal distances of solute transport to downstream waters. We apply the spatially explicit, mass-balance watershed model SPARROW to consider transport and transformations of water and nutrients throughout stream networks in the northeastern United States. We simulate fluxes of nitrogen, a primary nutrient that is a water-quality concern for acidification of streams and lakes and eutrophication of coastal waters, and refine the model structure to include literature observations of nitrogen removal in streams and lakes. We quantify nitrogen transport from headwaters to downstream navigable waters, where headwaters are defined within the model as first-order, perennial streams that include flow and nitrogen contributions from smaller, intermittent and ephemeral streams. We find that first-order headwaters contribute approximately 70% of the mean-annual water volume and 65% of the nitrogen flux in second-order streams. Their contributions to mean water volume and nitrogen flux decline only marginally to about 55% and 40% in fourth- and higher-order rivers that include navigable waters and their tributaries. These results underscore the profound influence that headwater areas have on shaping downstream water quantity and water quality. The results have relevance to water-resource management and regulatory decisions and potentially broaden understanding of the spatial extent of Federal CWA jurisdiction in U.S. waters.Show less"
