0,"Buddendorf, WB",Mar 10 2019 ,Integration of juvenile habitat quality and river connectivity models to understand and prioritise the management of barriers for Atlantic salmon populations across spatial scales,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Diadromous fish populations are strongly affected by in-stream barriers that cause river network fragmentation, constraining productivity or preventing completion of their lifecycle. Removal or reduction of barrier impacts is a restoration measure associated with unambiguous benefits. Management of barriers is therefore often prioritised above other restoration actions. Barrier management is prioritised at local and national scales depending on funding. However, barrier prioritisation is potentially sub-optimal because existing tools do not consider habitat quality. Furthermore, effects of partial barriers (those passable under certain conditions) are uncertain, depending on location and potential cumulative effects.A framework is presented for assessing effects of impassable manmade barriers (IMBs) on longitudinal river network connectivity (percentage of upstream habitat accessible from the river mouth) for Atlantic salmon across spatial scales, using Scotland as an example. The framework integrates juvenile habitat quality and network connectivity models to (1) provide information necessary for local and national prioritisation of barriers, and (2) assess potential effects of passable manmade barriers (PMBs) within a sensitivity framework.If only IMBs are considered, high levels of longitudinal connectivity are observed across most of Scotland's rivers. Barrier prioritisation is sensitive to habitat weighting: not accounting for habitat quality can lead to over-or underestimating the importance of IMBs. Prioritisation is also highly sensitive to the passability of PMBs: if passability drops to <97% (combined up-and downstream passability), the mean effect of PMBs becomes greater than IMBs at the national level. Moreover, impacts on catchment connectivity, and thus production (number of juvenile salmon produced by the river), could be severe, suggesting a better understanding of the passability of PMBs is important for future management of migration barriers. The presented framework can be transferred to other catchments, regions, or countries where necessary data are available, making it a valuable tool to the broader restoration community.

1,"Kim, H",Aug 1 2018 ,Combining pyrosequencing and isotopic approaches to assess denitrification in a hyporheic zone,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Hyporheic zones are considered hot spots for numerically vast and phylogenetically diverse microbial communities. However, biogeochemical effects of hyporheic zones have rarely been investigated in detail because of the difficulty in accurately measuring denitrification in these zones. To date, little is known about the hydroecology of hyporheic zones. The effect of changes in hydraulic conditions on the community variations of indigenous microorganisms and water quality was examined based on the depth of the hyporheic zone. In particular, we report on the use of the pyrosequencing technique to elucidate denitrifying bacteria (DNB) community profiles combined with the stable isotope composition of nitrate and hydrological patterns in the hyporheic zones to reveal whether denitrification occurs. delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3 values of nitrate were analyzed to evaluate the transformation processes of nitrate in upwelling and downwelling areas and mixed zones. The isotope values indicated different origins of water in upwelling and downwelling zones and that denitrification occurred predominantly in the upwelling areas. Analyses of microbial communities in the hyporheic zone showed that the new genera, species, and isotope data were associated with the hydrological uniqueness of the hyporheic zones. The 16S rRNA sequences were determined and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the DNB communities distributed and gathered the genus Comamonas denitrificans within the mixing patterns of the hyporheic zones and that the relative scarcity of these microbes in these zones was caused by the lack of appropriate substrates. The delineation of the surface water-groundwater mixing zone was quantitatively determined by systematically combining the hydrological and heat transfer analyses and by comparing denitrifying bacteria communities and N isotope data. This study showed that pyrosequencing and isotopic approaches are useful for evaluating the transformation processes of nitrate at the upwelling and downwelling points of a hyporheic zone.

2,"Palumbo-Roe, B",Aug 2017 ,Limitations on the role of the hyporheic zone in chromium natural attenuation in a contaminated urban stream,APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"The urban hyporheic zone may offer natural attenuation potential for contaminants. This potential is contaminant-specific and may be spatially and temporally variable. The aim of this study was the assessment of the natural attenuation potential of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream receiving hexavalent chromium (Cr)-rich effluents from the historical land disposal of chromite ore processing residue (COPR) in Glasgow, Scotland. The evidence based approach involved the use of a network of multilevel piezometers for best capturing potential anoxic field conditions and fine-scale spatial gradients in solute concentrations of surface water and porewater. In-situ porewater sampling was integrated with sediment sampling and reach-scale monitoring of stream water quality. The results show a sharp decrease of total dissolved (filtered <0.45 gm) Cr concentrations at the surface water sediment boundary in all profiles, from Cr mean values of 1100 mu g l(-1) in surface water to 5 mu g l(-1) in porewater. Chromium speciation analysis indicates that no Cr(VI) was detectable in the neutral pH, moderately reducing porewater, while it was the dominant species in surface water. Evidence of historical COPR detrital grains contributed to the total Cr concentrations (size fraction <150 mu m) up to 8800 mg kg(-1) in the streambed sediment. The abundance in the porewater of Fe (mean value = 1700 mu g l(-1)), mainly as Fe(II), a natural electron donor for Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III), indicates a high natural attenuation potential of the hyporheic zone for downwelling dissolved Cr, through Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) and the formation of Cr(III) solids of low solubility. Authigenic Cr-rich rims on particles also documented active Cr precipitation from solution in the fine sediments. Large short-term changes of stream stage and stream water composition were not reflected in the hyporheic conservative (chloride) and reactive solute composition. This result indicates only limited surface water infiltration and suggests that small advective exchange might limit the effectiveness of the hyporheic zone for enhancing Cr surface water quality at the reach-scale. This is supported by further evidence from preliminary surface water quality synoptic sampling which shows only moderate to low downstream decrease in surface water Cr concentrations. The surface water investigation needs to be supported by combined water quality-flow monitoring and to be extended to a wider range of temporal and spatial scales to corroborate the reach-scale findings.

3,"Nicoll, T",Jan 15 2017 ,"Within-catchment variability in landscape connectivity measures in the Garang catchment, upper Yellow River",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"The degree of landscape connection has wide-ranging implications for sediment availability, frequency of transport, and the nature of sediment storage within a basin. Two methodological approaches for assessing landscape connectivity are applied within the Garang subcatchment of the upper Yellow River. A GIS-based geomorphometric index was calculated for the catchment and compared to a methodology linking interpretation of satellite imagery and field mapping of sediment storage to slope threshold analysis. Landscapes of the Garang catchment are highly contrasting and can be separated into three zones: i) a highly disconnected upper catchment of low-relief with large inactive sediment stores; ii) a transitional zone where present landscape dynamics are controlled in large part by past incisional processes in the form of large alluvial fan/terrace deposits; and iii) a highly connected and highly dissected landscape within the lower catchment that has little accommodation space for sediment storage. The geomorphometric index shows general agreement with the patterns in landscape connectivity observed through imagery and field investigations. However, it estimates similar levels of connectivity in landscapes with observed (dis)connectivity, reflecting limitations of the calculation. While rapidly calculated geomorphometric indices of landscape connectivity provide useful appraisals of relative within-catchment variability in systems such as the Garang catchment, caution is urged in conducting broader-scale analyses using the same tools. Findings from this study highlight the importance of field-informed appraisals of landscape dynamics, site-specific characteristics and the imprint of historical (evolutionary) context in making such comparative assessments.

4,"Gay, A",Jan 2016 ,Application of an index of sediment connectivity in a lowland area,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"Sediment connectivity at the landscape scale has gained interest in the last few decades. Distributed approaches, such as topographic indices, are widely used to evaluate this connectivity. However, most of the research efforts are concentrated in mountainous areas while little work has been done in lowland areas where evidence of high connectivity has been reported. The objectives of this study are as follows: (i) to integrate landscape infiltration/runoff properties in the assessment of connectivity to account for lowland processes and (ii) to apply this approach to a large territory with both mountainous and lowland areas.The topographic index of connectivity (IC) of Borselli et al. (2008) was computed for the Loire-Brittany River Basin (> 10(5) km(2)). A distributed parameter (IDPR) that reflects landscape infiltration and saturation properties due to underlying geological formation characteristics is introduced. We integrated this parameter in a revised index (IC (revised) ) as an indicator of landscape hydrologic connectivity. Results at the pixel scale are aggregated at the watershed scale.Two maps of connectivity are produced, considering the initial IC and the revised form (IC (revised) ). As expected, the IC gives the highest connectivity in the steepest areas and does not reflect the existing connectivity in lowland areas. On the contrary, the IC (revised) computed in this study profoundly modifies the sediment connectivity values. These changes are evenly distributed over the entire territory and affected 51.5 % of the watersheds. As a result, we obtained a better correlation between calculated connectivity and the observed drainage density (which reflects the actual connections between hillslopes and rivers) in areas where slopes are gentle (< 7 %).Topographic indices do not reflect the real sediment connectivity in lowland areas, but their adaptation by considering runoff processes of such areas is possible. The IC (revised) presents an interesting perspective to define other highly connected areas at the country scale, as 17 % of the French territory is characterized by very gentle slopes with high runoff capacity.Show less"
5,"Sanchez-Perez, JM",2013 ,Role of the hyporheic heterotrophic biofilm on transformation and toxicity of pesticides,ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"The role of heterotrophic biofilm of water-sediment interface in detoxification processes was tested in abiotic and biotic conditions under laboratory conditions. Three toxicants, a herbicide (Diuron), a fungicide (Dimethomorph) and an insecticide (Chlorpyrifos-ethyl) have been tested in water percolating into columns reproducing hyporheic sediment. The detoxification processes were tested by comparing the water quality after 18 days of percolation with and without heterotrophic biofilm. Tested concentrations were 30 mu g.L-1 of Diuron diluted in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2 mu g.L-1 of Dimethomorph and 0.1 mu g.L-1 of Chlorpyrifos-ethyl. To characterise the detoxification efficiency of the system, we performed genotoxicity bioassays in amphibian larvae and rotifers and measured the respiration and denitrification of sediments. Although the presence of biofilm increased the production of N-(3,4 dichloropheny1)-N-(methyl)-urea, a metabolite of diuron, the toxicity did not decrease irrespective of the bioassay. In the presence of biofilm, Dimethomorph concentrations decreased compared with abiotic conditions, from 2 mu g.L-1 to 0.4 mu g.L-1 after 18 days of percolation. For both Dimethomorph and Chlorpyrifos-ethyl additions, assessment of detoxification level by the biofilm depended on the test used: detoxification effect was found with amphibian larvae bioassay and no detoxification was observed with the rotifer test. Heterotrophic biofilm exerts a major influence in the biochemical transformation of contaminants such as pesticides, suggesting that the interface between running water and sediment plays a role in self-purification of stream reaches.Show less"
6,"Lee, HS",Dec 2013 ,A configuration scheme for connectivity-aware mobile P2P networks for efficient mobile cloud-based video streaming services,CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,"Mobile cloud-based video streaming services cannot be provided seamlessly when network traffic increases sharply in congested areas such as colleges, universities, and downtown at specific times. This paper proposes a configuration scheme for connectivity-aware P2P networks which can reduce network traffic of cloud-based streaming servers through sharing of streaming video by utilizing information on connectivity status of mobile devices, and which can improve the quality of mobile cloud-based video streaming services by considering mobility of mobile devices and QoS which have not been considered in existing P2P schemes. Our proposed scheme reduces the amount of server traffic and the disconnection times of mobile devices significantly, compared to the non-P2P scheme and the AODV scheme. It also increases considerably the number of mobile devices to which a cloud-based streaming server can provide video streaming services simultaneously, compared to the two schemes.Show less"
7,"Lisenby, PE",Jul 2 2020 ,River sensitivity and sediment connectivity as tools for assessing future geomorphic channel behavior,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT,"The science of geomorphology is increasingly used to inform river management efforts; however, the complexity of fluvial systems makes predictions of future channel adjustment difficult at best. The geomorphic concepts of landform sensitivity and sediment connectivity are well suited to aid river managers in assessing the probability and variability of river channel responses. This can be especially helpful in planning for impacts of future climate change or changes in management activity. River sensitivity and sediment connectivity datasets provide a necessary reach-in-catchment perspective to inform geomorphic interpretations of river behaviour. Such interpretations constitute a first step towards providing the contextual geomorphic understanding necessary to establish expectations of future channel behaviour. In this paper, we use geomorphic interpretations based on river sensitivity and sediment connectivity datasets to describe the historical trajectory and future adjustment possibilities for four channel reaches in the Lockyer Valley, southeast Queensland (SEQ). We apply our interpretations to three different scenarios of future climate and river management conditions to constrain what forms of geomorphic adjustment are possible for resilient-disconnected, resilient-connected, sensitive-connected, and sensitive-disconnected channels. Using scenario-building exercises to forecast possibilities of river adjustment can aid river managers by establishing expectations of future channel behaviour. This information can then be fed into the decision-making process regarding where to prioritize management actions as part of catchment action planning that works with, not against, the natural behaviour of riverine environments.Show less"
8,"TREMOLIERES, M",Mar 26 1993 ,THE EXCHANGE PROCESS BETWEEN RIVER AND GROUNDWATER ON THE CENTRAL ALSACE FLOODPLAIN (EASTERN FRANCE) .1. THE CASE OF THE CANALISED RIVER RHINE,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The recent canalisation (in the nineteen sixties) of the upper Rhine has modified the exchange processes between the river and its groundwater in the floodplain of Alsace. The Rhine seeps through its gravelly bed and in this way feeds the nearby groundwater table by means of the so-called 'Rhine filtrates'. Using a few groundwater stream examples, this paper presents the characterization and localisation of these infiltrations. The Rhine filtrates are characterized by a high level of chloride and a low level of nitrate, these compounds being hydrological tracers, specific for the Alsatian floodplain (chloride resulting from contamination by the potash mines in the south of Alsace). They are also defined by high levels of phosphate and mercury (very localized injection). Phosphate is responsible for eutrophication which is observable in the appearance of specific aquatic macrophyte communities. Groundwater contamination by mercury is reflected by its accumulation in the bryophyte Fontinalis antipyretica sampled in groundwater streams. Thus aquatic vegetation, and more particularly the distribution of macrophyte communities, is used as an ecological descriptor of the exchange between the Rhine and its groundwater. The maximum injection of Rhine filtrates occurs between two areas of stillwater (hydroelectric dams), where the Rhine dominates its plain and where the substrate is constituted of coarse gravels.Show less"
9,"Dohman, JM",Oct 2021 ,Three-Dimensional Subsurface Flow Path Controls on Flow Permanence,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Intermittent streams currently constitute >50% of the global river network, and the number of intermittent streams is expected to increase due to changes in land use and climate. Surface flows are known to expand and contract within the headwater channel network due to changes in the water table driven by climate, often changing seasonally. However, the underlying causes of disconnections and reconnections throughout the stream network remain poorly understood and may reflect subsurface flow capacity. We assess how 3D subsurface flowpaths control local surface flows at Gibson Jack Creek in the Rocky Mountains, Idaho, USA. Water table dynamics, hydraulic gradients, and hyporheic exchange were monitored along a 200-m section of the stream throughout the seasonal recession in WY2018. Shallow lateral hillslope-riparian-stream connectivity was more frequent in transects spanning perennially flowing stream reaches than intermittent reaches. During low-flow periods, larger losing vertical hydraulic gradients were observed in paired piezometers in intermittent reaches than in adjacent perennial reaches. Contrary to dominant conceptual models, longitudinal measurements of hydrologic exchange in both intermittent and perennial reaches were seasonally variable except for one perennial reach that showed consistent significant gains. Observed drying dynamics, as well as subsurface pathways, were highly variable even over short distances (30 m). Flow probability and subsurface flow capacity at upstream locations can be assessed with an outlet hydrograph and upstream flow measurements. Accurate characterization of subsurface storage, discharge, and connection is critical to understanding the drivers of drying cycles in intermittent streams and their likely responses to future change.Show less"
10,"Barragan, VM",Feb 15 2006 ,Streaming potential across cation-exchange membranes in methanol-water electrolyte solutions,JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE,"Streaming potential measurements across charged membranes separating two equal solutions have been carried out. Two cation-exchange membranes with different cross-linked and swelling properties (Ionics and Nafion membranes) and methanol-water electrolyte solutions of KCl have been used in the experiments. The obtained results show that the streaming potential is higher for the Ionics membrane and that the values depend on the methanol content of the solutions. A different behavior is found in the dependence of the streaming potential on the methanol percentage for each membrane. The study of the relaxation times in the decay of electrokinetic steady states of streaming potential has been carried out from the time dependence of the streaming potential when the pressure difference through the membrane is suppressed. The results show the existence of two different parts or partial relaxations, mechanical and electric. A different behavior of the mechanical relaxation time with the methanol percentage has been found for the two membranes, but any significant difference between their electric relaxation times. These differences have been explained in terms of the different degree of swelling of the membranes used. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Show less"
11,"Beatty, SJ",Dec 2010 ,Groundwater contribution to baseflow maintains habitat connectivity for Tandanus bostocki (Teleostei: Plotosidae) in a south-western Australian river,ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,"A global biodiversity hotspot, south-western Australia is characterised by a highly endemic freshwater fish fauna that is severely impacted by habitat alterations. As is the case with many rivers in this region, the Blackwood River is secondarily salinised as a consequence of agricultural practices and this has caused population depletions of halo-intolerant fishes. This study is the first to examine the role that groundwater intrusion has in maintaining habitat connectivity for an obligate freshwater fish in a secondarily salinised river. We determined the significance of nonsaline groundwater intrusion in maintaining habitat and migratory routes of the freshwater cobbler, Tandanus bostocki during prolonged annual dry periods; characteristic of Mediterranean climatic zones. Tandanus bostocki undertook large, yet spatially and temporally variable, localised movements through riffles. During baseflow, the period of major groundwater influence, movements were significantly associated with discharge. Analysis of gonadal development suggested that such movements were not strictly related to reproduction and were probably for foraging purposes. The study reveals groundwater is crucial in maintaining migratory routes through riffles and suggests T. bostocki may be reliably used as an indicator of aquatic habitat connectivity in light of groundwater extractions and also continued rainfall reductions in this region due to climate change.Show less"

13,"Grapes, TR",Jun 30 2005 ,"Dynamics of river-aquifer interactions along a chalk stream: the River Lambourn, UK",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This paper describes the spatial and temporal pattern of groundwater flow accretion to the River Lambourn, a 234 km(2) chalk catchment of the West Berkshire Downs, UK, which has been largely unaffected by groundwater abstraction. Variations in the discharge measured at four fixed gauges in the catchment, coupled with information on the length of flowing channel over the period 1983-2001, are used to describe regional patterns in flow accretion. Mean catchment accretion generally exceeds 0.15 m(3) s(-1) km(-1), but there are significant differences between perennial reaches indicating how the combination of local structural controls and seasonal changes in the drainage net affect flow accretion. Data from current meter surveys were used to determine the spatial variability in flow accretion: 505 paired observations along 12 reaches between 1 and 2.95 kin in length indicated a consistent spatial trend in accretion. Accretion was high in upstream and downstream channel reaches, and in middle reaches where dry valleys intersected the main valley. A flow accretion index was developed to describe the relationship of flow accretion in each of the 12 study reaches to catchment discharge. The relationship varied from a strong positive correlation with catchment discharge (two reaches), a weak positive correlation (three reaches), a strong negative correlation (two reaches), to no relationship to catchment discharge (four reaches). The results highlight the need to reconsider the usual assumption of uniform, or uniformly increasing, flow accretion in chalk catchments. Moreover, they emphasize the importance of catchment topography, and illustrate how flow accretion in individual reaches may vary between high and low groundwater levels.

14,"Xie, YQ",Sep 2017 ,Limits of heat as a tracer to quantify transient lateral river-aquifer exchanges,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The application of heat as a tracer for assessing river-aquifer exchanges has been mainly limited to vertical flow through the riverbed. Lateral river-aquifer exchanges become more important than vertical riverbed exchanges if the river is deeply incised into an aquifer. Few studies have examined lateral river-aquifer exchanges and the ability of heat to constrain such exchanges. This study aims to perform a robust assessment of the limits of heat as a tracer to quantify lateral river-aquifer exchanges. The study is based on a section of the Meuse River in Belgium, a river predominantly gaining in the studied area and becoming intermittently losing in the winter time. A calibrated transect model shows that river temperature can affect groundwater temperature up to 9 m into the aquifer. An accompanying synthetic modeling investigation using Monte Carlo simulation shows that heat data for distances between 4 and 9 m from the river can reduce the uncertainty of river-aquifer exchanges for conditions similar to those of the transect model. The ability of heat to reduce the river-aquifer exchange uncertainty improves with distance from the river because of the reduction in the number of acceptable model realizations. The optimal distance is 8 m from the river where the groundwater temperature is no longer affected by the river temperature. The synthetic modeling also indicates that heat alone cannot constrain river-aquifer exchanges better than the commonly used hydraulic head. However, when combined with hydraulic head, heat can significantly reduce the uncertainty of river-aquifer lateral exchanges under gaining conditions.Show less"
15,"Romeijn, P",Apr 20 2021 ,Macrophyte Controls on Urban Stream Microbial Metabolic Activity,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Urban rivers worldwide are affected directly by macrophyte growth, causing reduced flow velocity and risks of flooding. Therefore, cutting macrophytes is a common management practice to ensure free drainage. The impacts of macrophyte removal on transient storage dynamics and microbial metabolic activity of wastewater-fed urban streams are unknown, preventing any assessment of the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical consequences of this management practice. Slug tracer injections were performed with the conservative tracer uranine and the reactive tracer resazurin to quantify the implications of macrophyte cutting on stream flow dynamics and metabolism. Macrophyte cutting reduced mean tracer arrival times in managed stream reaches but did not significantly decrease whole-stream microbial metabolic activity. In fact, transient storage indices were found to have increased after cutting, suggesting that macrophyte removal and the resulting increase in flow velocity may have enhanced hyporheic exchange flow through streambed sediments. Our results evidence that macrophyte cutting in nutrient-rich urban streams does not necessarily lead to lower in-stream storage and metabolism but that the gain in hyporheic exchange and streambed microbial metabolic activity can compensate for reduced in-stream storage. Increased stream flow resulting from macrophyte removal may therefore even enhance nutrient and pollutant attenuation capacity of streambed sediments.Show less"
16,"Kim, H",Apr 2019 ,Culturable bacteria diversity in surface water-groundwater exchange zones by 16S rRNA gene analysis,JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA,"This study identified 16S rRNA genes using PCR to find out culturable microorganisms living in the samples of surface water, surface water-groundwater exchange zones (hyporheic zones), ground water collected in the Haean bain, Yanggu-gun, Gangwon-do. Bacterial count of culturable microorganisms was 2.5x10(5) CFU/ml in the hyporheic water, which was over 10 times higher than those in the surface water and the ground water. Moreover, measurements of bacterial counts by separation into aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms found 10-100 times more aerobic bacteria than anaerobic bacteria. Identification through sequencing of 16S rRNA gene resulted in 40 genera of aerobic bacteria and 21 genera of anaerobic bacteria in the hyporheic water. Of the aerobic bacteria, the Pseudomonas genus was most dominant with about 29.3% in proportion, followed by the Flavobacterium genus with about 15.3%. Excluding genera separated from the surface water and the ground water, a total of 31 aerobic genera and 16 anaerobic genera were identified in the hyporheic water. It is expected that a comparative analysis between metagenomics data obtained from samples in the hyporheic water by pyrosequencing and culturable microorganisms of the present study should be able to provide more solid fundamental data on physiological characteristics and roles of microorganisms living in hyporheic zones and would enable to conduct more quantitative study.Show less"
17,"Akhtar, N",Feb 2022 ,Upscaling of Surface Water and Groundwater Interactions in Hyporheic Zone from Local to Regional Scale,WATER,"The groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) interaction (SW-GW) through the hyporheic zone is a significant component in sustainable water resource management. The complexities in SW-GW interactions increase from a local to a regional scale and are affected by variation in hydraulic, hydrologic, and hydrogeologic (3H) processes. Controlling factors and their upscaling of these processes to assess SW-GW interaction have not been addressed sufficiently in previous studies. Additionally, it is unclear what the effective factors are at different scales during the upscaling. Therefore, the present review focused on controlling factors of 3H processes in SW-GW interaction and their upscaling techniques. Relevancy of controlling factors was identified at different scales. Applications of different approaches and their uncertainties were also discussed for the characterization of SW-GW interactions. The study revealed that the improved data from different approaches is crucial for machine learning training and its application in the SW and GW assessment at local, sub-catchment, and catchment scales. Based on the outcomes, a framework has been proposed to execute modalities of controlling factors using remote sensing, geophysics, and artificial intelligence. The proposed framework could help in handling big data and accurate upscaling for water resource management.Show less"
18,"Cheng, ZL",Jul 2022 ,Recession and hysteresis effects of hyporheic zone permeability changes on baseflow in seasonal freeze-thaw mountainous areas,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Baseflow is the main groundwater discharge mode from mountainous areas to rivers and is an important component of river runoff. Temperature changes in the hyporheic zone in seasonal freeze-thaw areas cause changes in its permeability, which then affect the recession of baseflow. It is critical to study underground surface water transformation processes in cold regions to explore baseflow recession and hysteresis effects caused by permeability changes in the hyporheic zone under variable temperatures. In this study, we investigated the Hanyangtun Basin in the Changbai Mountain District to determine the functional relationship between permeability and temperature in the hyporheic zone using theoretical analysis combined with laboratory saturated permeability experiments using medium-and fine-grained sand at variable temperatures. We then calculated and analyzed the recession amplitude and hysteresis time of the baseflow caused by permeability changes in the hyporheic zone of this freeze-thaw mountainous area using water temperature and reference baseflow data. The results indicate that owing to large temperature changes in the study area, the permeability of the hyporheic zone changed substantially. Lower permeability leads to the blocking of groundwater discharging to surface water, i. e., the baseflow hysteresis effect. The recession amplitude of the baseflow caused by lower permeability increased with decreasing temperatures, reaching a maximum of 41.67%. The groundwater discharge hysteresis time increased with decreasing temperature. The hysteresis effect was most obvious during the stable melting period, with a maximum hysteresis time of 16 days, while the total annual hysteresis time was 60 days. This study provides a new perspective for qualitative and quantitative studies of the relationship between groundwater and surface water in the mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze-thaw.Show less"
19,"Van den Brink, FWB",Oct 2013 ,Seasonal changes in caddis larvae assemblages in river-floodplain habitats along a hydrological connectivity gradient,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"In order to assess the impact of seasonality versus connectivity on the ecological quality of the Lower Rhine river-floodplain habitats, we studied the seasonal variation in diversity and species assemblages of caddis larvae by monthly sampling of the littoral zone of four water bodies over a lateral connectivity gradient. Seasonal variation in diversity showed a general pattern in these floodplain habitats and could be related to caddisfly life history and habitat preferences. Despite this seasonal variation, caddis larvae species assemblages in the water bodies appeared to be rather stable and could be firmly related to the position of their habitats over the connectivity gradient. The main channel (lotic habitat) was clearly separated from the lentic water bodies, and also the sparsely vegetated water bodies from the well-vegetated water bodies. It is concluded that the impact of connectivity, and related parameters such as stream velocity and vegetation coverage, outweighed the impact of season on the caddis larvae assemblages.Show less"
20,"Deng, XJ",Nov 2018 ,"Spatial-temporal changes in the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in the Taihu Plain, China",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the process-based connections between upstream and downstream areas and is fundamental to understanding the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological behaviour of river basins. However, the quantification of such connectivity remains a challenge due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods, especially in delta plains. In this study, based on the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations, a new and quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index (LFCI) was developed for delta plains. Focusing on the Taihu Plain, we then analysed the spatial-temporal changes in the LFCI during 1960-2012 and investigated the correlations between the LFCI and climate change and human activities. We found that the decadal, annual and seasonal changes in the average LFCI all presented slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period, but the annual average LFCI increased significantly after 1978; the average LFCIs in June, July, and August of the flood season were less than those in other months in the Taihu Plain. We also found that the spatial-temporal changes in the average LFCI exhibited larger differences at the subregional and station scales; those in the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu subregion were least, and the average LFCIs at stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations. Moreover, we found that the average LFCI had significant correlations with precipitation, river density and water surface ratio. Our results were consistent with common sense facts, which demonstrated that the indicator developed in this study can quite effectively quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains.Show less"
21,"Sullivan, SMP",May 2009 ,"Stream-floodplain connectivity and fish assemblage diversity in the Champlain Valley, Vermont, USA",JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,"To evaluate the influence of main channel-floodplain connectivity on fish assemblage diversity in floodplains associated with streams and small rivers, fish assemblages and habitat characteristics were surveyed at 24 stream reaches in the Champlain Valley of Vermont, U.S.A. Fish assemblages differed markedly between the main channel and the floodplain. Fish assemblage diversity was greatest at reaches that exhibited high floodplain connectivity. Whereas certain species inhabited only main channels or floodplains, others utilized both main channel and floodplain habitats. Both floodplain fish alpha-diversity and gamma-diversity of the entire stream corridor were positively correlated with connectivity between the main channel and its floodplain. Consistent with these results, species turnover (as measured by beta-diversity) was negatively correlated with floodplain connectivity. Floodplains with waterbodies characterized by a wide range of water depths and turbidity levels exhibited high fish diversity. The results suggest that by separating rivers from their floodplains, incision and subsequent channel widening will have detrimental effects on multiple aspects of fish assemblage diversity across the stream-floodplain ecosystem.Show less"
22,"Sondergaard, M",Dec 2007 ,"Anthropogenic impacts on lake and stream ecosystems, and approaches to restoration",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Freshwater ecosystems have long been affected by numerous types of human interventions that have a negative impact on their water quality and ecological state. Fortunately, in most western countries the input of sewage to freshwater systems has been reduced, but hydromorphological alterations, eutrophication-related turbidity and loss of biodiversity remain major problems in many parts of the world. Such impacts prevent the achievement of a high or good ecological state, as defined by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) or other standards.This paper synthesizes and links the findings presented in the seven papers of this special profile, focusing on the effects of anthropogenic stressors on freshwater ecosystems and on how to maintain and restore ecological quality. The papers cover a broad range of research areas and methods, but are all centred on the relationship between dispersal barriers, the connectivity of waterways and the restoration of rivers and lakes.The construction of dams and reservoirs disturbs the natural functioning of many streams and rivers and shore-line development around lakes may reduce habitat complexity. New methods demonstrate how reservoirs may have a severe impact on the distribution and connectivity of fish populations, and new techniques illustrate the potential of using graph theory and connectivity models to illustrate the ecological implications. Hydromorphologically degraded rivers and streams can be restored by addition of wood debris, but 'passive' restoration via natural wood recruitment may be preferable. The most cost-effective way to restore streams may also include information campaigns to farmers on best management practices. Removal of zooplanktivorous fish often has marked positive effects on trophic structure in lakes, but there is a tendency to return to turbid conditions after 8-10 years or less unless fish removal is repeated.Synthesis and applications. Development of new methods, as well as derivation of more general conclusions from reviewing the effects of previous restoration efforts, are crucial to achieve progress in applied freshwater research. The papers contained in this Special Profile contribute on both counts, as well as illustrating the importance of well-designed research projects and monitoring programmes to record the effects of the interventions. Such efforts are vital if we are to improve our knowledge of freshwater systems and to elaborate the best and most cost-effective recommendations. They may also help in achieving a good ecological state or potential in water bodies by 2015, as demanded by the European WFD.Show less"
23,"Costa, D",Dec 2016 ,Coupling spatially distributed river and groundwater transport models to investigate contaminant dynamics at river corridor scales,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"Rivers and aquifers are mutually dependent components of the hydrological cycle, typically characterised by temporal dynamics that are a few orders of magnitude apart. This characteristic is often advocated to justify the use of independent single-system models to maximise the outcome for the available computational resources. However, the rapid increase in computational power presently provides means to explore new and more complex modelling schemes, which better reflect the complex physical reality. We present a new modelling framework, FLUXOS, developed from the full coupling of modified versions of state-of-the-art standalone river and groundwater flow and transport models. The model is validated against analytical solutions and applied to real world scenarios in the complex urban corridor of the Ciliwung River in Jakarta to show its flexibility for practical applications and its capabilities as an exploratory tool for realistic investigation of contamination sources and pathways determining nonlinear behaviours of river-aquifer interactions.

24,"Merenlender, AM",Nov 2013 ,Maintaining and restoring hydrologic habitat connectivity in mediterranean streams: an integrated modeling framework,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Hydrologic alterations designed to provide a stable water supply and to prevent flooding are commonly used in mediterranean-climate river (med-rivers) basins, and these alterations have led to habitat loss and significant declines in aquatic biodiversity. Often the health of freshwater ecosystems depends on maintaining and recovering hydrologic habitat connectivity, which includes structural components related to the physical landscape, functionality of flow dynamics, and an understanding of species habitat requirements for movement, reproduction, and survival. To advance our understanding of hydrologic habitat connectivity and benefits of habitat restoration alternatives we provide: (1) a review of recent perspectives on hydrologic connectivity, including quantitative methods; and (2) a modeling framework to quantify the effects of restoration on hydrologic habitat connectivity. We then illustrate this approach through a case study on lateral hydrologic habitat connectivity that results from channel restoration scenarios using scenarios with different historic and climate-change flows to restore fish floodplain habitat in a med-river, the San Joaquin River, California. Case study results show that in addition to the channel alterations, higher flows are required to recover significant flooded habitat area, especially given reductions in flows expected under climate change. These types of studies will help the planning for restoration of hydrologic habitat connectivity in med-rivers, a critical step for mediterranean species recovery.Show less"
25,"Irawan, DE",Feb 2015 ,"Groundwater-surface water interactions of Ciliwung River streams, segment Bogor-Jakarta, Indonesia",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"CiliwungRiver water quality and its vicinity have been continuously degraded with the increasing population. The objective of this research is to understand the association between river and groundwater, and the water quality profile. Field measurements ware taken from 65 stations from Bogor to Jakarta. Water level, temperature, pH, and TDS were measured to build the water flow map and hydrochemical profile. Small-scale geoelectrical survey was conducted at five locations to capture the aquifer's geometry. We identified three types of stream relationships between river and groundwater: effluent from Bogor to Katulampa (Segment 1), perched at the University of Indonesia (UI) area (Segment 2), and influent from UI to Muara (Segment 3), with low gradient from <0.1 to 0.3. The temperature profile of river and groundwater shows similar pattern as well as TDS profile. All similarities support close connection of river and groundwater. The increasing TDS towards downstream shows increasing enrichment and contamination. The erratic pattern of pH indicates chemical instability due to high contamination. This study highlights the benefit of understanding the hydrodynamic relationship between river water and groundwater. Such interaction triggers water quality exchange between both water bodies. Therefore, a similar study should also be done on other riverbanks in Indonesia to protect water quality.Show less"
26,"Fusco, NA",Jan 2021 ,Urbanization reduces gene flow but not genetic diversity of stream salamander populations in the New York City metropolitan area,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,"Natural landscape heterogeneity and barriers resulting from urbanization can reduce genetic connectivity between populations. The evolutionary, demographic, and ecological effects of reduced connectivity may lead to population isolation and ultimately extinction. Alteration to the terrestrial and aquatic environment caused by urban influence can affect gene flow, specifically for stream salamanders who depend on both landscapes for survival and reproduction. To examine how urbanization affects a relatively common stream salamander species, we compared genetic connectivity ofEurycea bislineata(northern two-lined salamander) populations within and between streams in an urban, suburban, and rural habitat around the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. We report reduced genetic connectivity between streams within the urban landscape found to correspond with potential barriers to gene flow, that is, areas with more dense urbanization (roadways, industrial buildings, and residential housing). The suburban populations also exhibited areas of reduced connectivity correlated with areas of greater human land use and greater connectivity within a preserve protected from development. Connectivity was relatively high among neighboring rural streams, but a major roadway corresponded with genetic breaks even though the habitat contained more connected green space overall. Despite greater human disturbance across the landscape, urban and suburban salamander populations maintained comparable levels of genetic diversity to their rural counterparts. Yet small effective population size in the urban habitats yielded a high probability of loss of heterozygosity due to genetic drift in the future. In conclusion, urbanization impacted connectivity among stream salamander populations where its continual influence may eventually hinder population persistence for this native species in urban habitats.Show less"
27,"Querner, EP",Jan 2 2016 ,Simulating streamflow variability and aquatic states in temporary streams using a coupled groundwater-surface water model,HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,"In order to apply the EU Water Framework Directive for temporary streams, it is important to quantify the space-time development of different aquatic states. We report on research on the development of aquatic states for temporary streams in the Evrotas basin, Greece. The SIMGRO regional hydrological model was used in a GIS framework to generate flow time series for the Evrotas River and all major tributaries. Five flow phases were distinguished: flood conditions, riffles, connected pools, isolated pools and dry bed conditions. Thresholds based on local hydraulic characteristics were identified per stream reach and flow phase, enabling the frequency of flow phases per month and the average frequencies for all streams to be derived. Three historical scenarios within the 20th century, marking periods of major changes in water management, were investigated. Additionally, a climate scenario for the 2050s was analysed. Simulations revealed that low flows are now much lower, mainly because more groundwater is abstracted for irrigation. The consequence is that stretches of the river fall dry during several months, causing the ecological status to deteriorate.Show less"
28,"Cucchi, K",Jun 2018 ,LOMOS-mini: A coupled system quantifying transient water and heat exchanges in streambeds,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The LOMOS-mini is a new experimental system monitoring transient water and heat fluxes in the hyporheic zone at a sub-daily resolution. Given the coupling of high-frequency hydraulic head gradient and temperature measurements, its innovation when compared to currently available monitoring systems is to operate under transient conditions and to allow the quantification of coupled water and heat exchanges with an unprecented fine temporal resolution, such as the rainfall event time scale. The LOMOS-mini is low-cost, easy to construct from individual microelectronic components and has an autonomy of several months in the field. Its robust implementation protocol makes it suitable for a wide variety of geological environments, from soft loamy, sandy, clayey streambeds to compact colluvial environments. Hydraulic head gradients are measured using the pressure sensor technology presented in Greswell et al. (2009). The sensibility of pressure estimates to ambient temperature is demonstrated; the measurement error is evaluated to decrease by up to one order of magnitude when accounting for temperature in the calibration relationship. Coupled with a physically-based hydrothermal model, the LOMOS-mini provides transient estimates of vertically distributed Darcy fluxes, conductive and advective heat fluxes. The methodology is illustrated on a colluvial streambed case study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
29,"Spice, EK",Apr 2019 ,Contemporary and historical river connectivity influence population structure in western brook lamprey in the Columbia River Basin,CONSERVATION GENETICS,"The western brook lamprey Lampetra richardsoni (WBL) is a small non-parasitic lamprey that inhabits rivers and streams from southern Alaska to northern California. WBL remain in fresh water throughout their entire life and show limited dispersal. Although adults may migrate short distances upstream to spawn, most movement likely occurs through passive drifting of larvae downstream. Genetic differentiation among populations is thus expected to be high, even within a single basin, but WBL population structure has received little attention. The present study examined population connectivity of WBL from 23 sites throughout the Columbia River Basin and coastal Washington, using eight microsatellite loci and cytochrome b sequence data. Although population structure generally corresponded to contemporary river connectivity, there were some cases where genetic patterns were better explained by historical connections. Microsatellite genetic differentiation among populations separated by <570km was moderate to high; F-ST values ranged from -0.0026 to 0.7117 and averaged 0.2929. Tributary distance was the best predictor of F-ST, suggesting that most gene flow takes place in tributaries rather than through the mainstem of the Columbia River. As predicted, gene flow occurred primarily in a downstream direction, resulting in lower genetic diversity in upstream sites. WBL populations in these areas may be particularly vulnerable to local extinction. Therefore, whereas anadromous lamprey management efforts are focused on improving passage at mainstem dams, conservation of WBL will require protection of individual watersheds with particular emphasis on headwater areas.Show less"
30,"Ulseth, AJ",Apr 2019 ,Distinct air-water gas exchange regimes in low- and high-energy streams,NATURE GEOSCIENCE,"Gas exchange across the air-water interface drives the flux of climate-relevant gases and is critical for biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. Despite the presence of mountain streams worldwide, we lack basic understanding of gas exchange through their turbulent surfaces, making global estimates of outgassing from streams and rivers difficult to constrain. Here we combine new estimates of gas transfer velocities from tracer gas additions in mountain streams with published data to cover streams differing in geomorphology and hydraulics. We find two different scaling relationships between the turbulence-induced energy dissipation rate and gas transfer velocity for low- and high-channel slope streams, indicating that gas exchange in streams exists in two states. We suggest that turbulent diffusion drives gas transfer velocity in low-energy streams; whereas turbulence entrains air bubbles in high-energy streams, and the resulting bubble-mediated gas exchange accelerates with energy dissipation rate. Gas transfer velocities in the high-energy streams are among the highest reported. Our findings offer a framework to include mountain streams in future estimates of gas fluxes from streams and rivers at the global scale.Show less"
31,"Lambeets, K",Mar 2010 ,"Spatial genetic variation of a riparian wolf spider Pardosa agricola (Thorell, 1856) on lowland river banks: The importance of functional connectivity in linear spatial systems",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,"Habitat patches along river systems are often highly isolated and characterised by a high degree of heterogeneity at different spatio-temporal scales. The connectivity between river bank arthropod populations directly adjoining the river channel is often greatly disturbed due to river regulation. While flight-active arthropods easily disperse upstream, less mobile species are expected to show predominant downstream dispersal unless specific upward movements are prevalent. In linear river ecosystems, downstream drift of organisms may therefore prevail with subsequently strong asymmetrical gene flow. We analysed patterns of genetic variation within and among nine spatially structured populations of the highly stenotopic riparian wolf spider (Lycosidae) Pardosa agricola (Thorell, 1856) using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers. No evidence was found for downstream accumulation of genetic diversity. The high genetic diversity is hypothesised to be the result of historical drift processes. Nearby populations on the same river shore were less genetically differentiated compared with populations further away and/or on the opposite shore. This indicates that short-distance dispersal still occurs on river banks during low water flow levels, but at the same time that the river channel constitutes a physical barrier for species exchange between opposite shores. The rehabilitation of the riparian corridor will increase the amount of suitable habitat, the functional connectivity during periods of low flow-discharges and eventually riparian spider population persistence.

32,"Tian, K",Jul 2021 ,"Grading Evaluation of the Structural Connectivity of River System Networks Based on Ecological Functions, and a Case Study of the Baiyangdian Wetland, China",WATER,"River system network (RSN) connectivity is important to maintain the environmental and ecological functions of wetlands. Quantitative evaluation of connectivity can provide crucial support for efforts to improve wetland connectivity and to restore and protect wetland ecosystems. Most existing evaluation methods uniformly generalise RSN to form an undifferentiated RSN of edges and nodes that is taken as a whole to evaluate the connectivity. However, actual RSNs comprise rivers, canals, ditches, lakes, and ponds, which differ substantially in their structures, morphologies, and attributes. The mix of RSN elements therefore defines grades that give RSNs distinctive characteristics. Moreover, RSNs with different grades perform different ranges of environmental and ecological functions. The existing evaluation methods, which have some limitations, do not account for these characteristics. To account for these differences, we examined the grade characteristics and their impact on environmental and ecological functions. We established a grading system of RSN elements and a grading method of RSN, and constructed the structural connectivity evaluation indicator system for RSNs at different grades. On this basis, we propose a method for grading evaluation of RSN connectivity. We used China's Baiyangdian Wetland to demonstrate the use of the system and validate the results. The proposed method provided an objective and accurate evaluation of RSN connectivity and clarified the differences in connectivity among RSNs with different grades, thereby providing improved guidance for the development and maintenance of the environmental and ecological functions of RSNs.Show less"
33,"Xie, CJ",May 12 2022 ,"Longitudinal Dynamics of Hydrological Connectivity in the Yellow River Delta, China",FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"River deltas are formed by the interaction of connecting water and sediment, and they are among the most economically and ecologically valuable ecosystems on Earth. Because of their special locations, together with direct and indirect human interference, river deltas are expected to be more vulnerable and fragmented. The increasing fragmentation of deltas is largely due to longitudinal hydrological connectivity disruption caused by human activities. However, the dynamics of longitudinal connectivity are unknown, especially in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), which has been subjected to heavy reclamation in recent years. In this study, we divided the whole YRD into three subregions, the erosion zone, the oilfield zone and the deposition zone, and then we used indicators to explore the spatiotemporal variation in hydrological connectivity on the whole scale and on the zonal scale of the delta during 1984-2018 in the YRD. We found that the variation in longitudinal hydrological connectivity was closely related to the geometry of the tidal channel networks, and that the changes in longitudinal hydrological connectivity varied with research scales. A weak increasing trend of connectivity was found on the whole scale of the delta during the past three decades. A decreasing trend of connectivity was found in both the erosion zone and the oilfield zone. In the deposition zone, however, the connectivity degree was enhanced. Furthermore, we also identified the key impaired area and relatively stable area of hydrological connectivity in the YRD and implied that the key impaired area may be a priority restoration zone of the impaired hydrological connectivity zone. Our study provides useful scientific guidance for the subsequent restoration of damaged wetlands.Show less"
34,"Mehmood, T",Mar 2022 ,Testing alternative conceptual models of river-aquifer connectivity and their impacts on baseflow and river recharge processes,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This study simulates the dynamics of exchange fluxes between Brazos River Alluvium Aquifer and the Brazos River, TX. Seven conceptual models for the connection between the river and the aquifer were simulated in HYDRUS 2D using small-scale, high-resolution transects across the river. These models assumed varying aquifer lithology and river incision depths and considered processes such as riverbed clogging and seepage face flows. Observed river stage values were used to specify a time-variable head boundary, and the simulations were tested against observed hydraulic heads in two nearby monitoring wells. The nearly 1.5 years of sub-hourly measurements spanned both flood and drought periods. The best-fit conceptual model supported a hypothesized hydraulic disconnection between the subsurface near the river and the wider alluvial aquifer. In contrast to the assumptions of previous studies, these data were more consistent with the presence of a thin, low-K structure (such as an abandoned paleochannel) rather than riverbed clogging. Across the range of models evaluated, the average net exchange between the river and the aquifer ranged from 0.016 to 12.4 m(3)/d/m. Most of the variability was attributed to baseflow across the riverbed, which ranged from 0.18 to 13.1 m(3)/d/m depending on the model. The ranges of exchange fluxes across the seepage face (0.004 to 2.37 m(3)/d/m) and recharge from the river to the aquifer (0.1 to 5.63 m(3)/d/m) were significant, but not as influential. Based on these values, the choice of conceptual model could have a profound impact on the accuracy of numerical models used for river management. Extrapolated across the entire reach, this uncertainty would amount to +/- 83 m(3)/s of discharge, equivalent to 34% of the river's discharge near its outlet.Show less"
35,"Liu, JK",Feb 1 2020 ,Multi-scale analysis of hydrological connectivity and plant response in the Yellow River Delta,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The Yellow River Delta is one of the International Important Wetlands on the west coastline of the Pacific Ocean in China. Despite its importance for regional and global ecological security, it is vulnerable because of human activities and climate change. Local government is trying to identify a more efficient way to conserve the delta thereby reducing a potential environmental crisis. The framework of hydrological connectivity provides a new perspective to study hydrological related ecological processes, while the method is highly exclusive because of environment and scale heterogeneity. This study collaborated with managers to develop a new algorithm to parameterize the hydrological connectivity on plot, point and landscape scales. Then the interspecific and conspecific structures of two dominate species (Phragmites communis and Suaeda salsa) are linked to these indices. The results show: (1) According to the point and plot scale results, AP (semi-artificial pond) and IF (intertidal flat) has the strongest hydrological connectivity followed by TM (tidal marsh). The average positive point-scale index values in AP, IF RS (river side wetland) and TM are 0.610, 0.495, 1.162 and 1.217 and the average plot-scale index values in AP, IF RS and TM are 1.53, 0.87, 0.48 0.55. At the landscape scale, index values show high collinearity with plot density and lack of hydrological significance because of low data resolution and scale effects. (2) At the individual level, P. communis and S. salsa showed a higher interspecific and conspecific competitive strength to respond to environmental stress in the weak hydrological connectivity area. (3) At the community level, in higher salinity wetland classes, biomass, plant coverage and biodiversity showed a positive linear correlation with plot-scale indices. Future study will improve the current parametrization method at the landscape scale and reveal the response of other important plant species to hydrological connectivity in this area.

36,"Naegeli, MW",Sep 1996 ,Ground penetrating radar for assessing sediment structures in the hyporheic zone of a prealpine river,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used to investigate the structure of the sediments in a floodprone gravel-bed river. Measurements were made on 2 gravel bars and in the adjacent channel. We buried a metallic object to calibrate depth and to visualize changes in GPR-profiles taken before and after digging. In addition, along 2 GPR-profiles the structure of the alluvial sediment of a gravel bar was visually verified by digging a trench down to the groundwater table. The GPR method enables,ne to distinguish sedimentary units of different texture with a vertical resolution of about 0.25 m. The investigation showed the depth of the alluvial valley fill, and it revealed geomorphological features such as lateral point bar accretion, fills of former pools, or open framework textures. These structures form a complex 3-dimensional mosaic of sediment patches. The GPR method also allowed us to document the changes resulting from bed-moving floods, such as in the formation of homogeneous gravel sheets during high magnitude floods. At some sites we observed intercalations of coarse organic matter between adjacent sedimentary units. Based on GPR data and the analysis of geomorphological structures near the study site, we developed a diagrammatic model of the sediments of this site in the lower Necker Valley.Show less"
37,"Ward, AS",Sep 2013 ,How does rapidly changing discharge during storm events affect transient storage and channel water balance in a headwater mountain stream?,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Measurements of transient storage in coupled surface-water and groundwater systems are widely made during base flow periods and rarely made during storm flow periods. We completed 24 sets of slug injections in three contiguous study reaches during a 1.25 year return interval storm event (discharge ranging from 21.5 to 434 L s(-1)) in a net gaining headwater stream within a steep, constrained valley. Repeated studies over a 9 day period characterize transient storage and channel water from prestorm conditions through storm discharge recession. Although the valley floor was always gaining from the hillslopes based on hydraulic gradients, we observed exchange of water from the stream to the valley floor throughout the study and flow conditions. Interpretations of transient storage and channel water balance are complicated by dynamic in-stream and near-stream processes. Metrics of transient storage and channel water balance were significantly different (95% confidence level) between the three study reaches and could be identified independently of stream discharge via analysis of normalized breakthrough curves. These differences suggest that the morphology of each study reach was the primary control on solute tracer transport. Unlike discharge, metrics of transient storage and channel water balance did not return to the prestorm values. We conclude that discharge alone is a poor predictor of tracer transport in stream networks during storm events. Finally, we propose a perceptual model for our study site that links hydrologic dynamics in 3-D along the hillslope-riparian-hyporheic-stream continuum, including down-valley subsurface transport.Show less"
38,"Larsen, LG",Mar 2015 ,Mechanisms of nutrient retention and its relation to flow connectivity in river-floodplain corridors,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Understanding heterogeneity or patchiness in the distribution of vegetation and retention of C and nutrients in river corridors is critical for setting priorities for river management and restoration. Several mechanisms of spatial differentiation in nutrient retention in river and floodplain corridors have been recognized, but few studies have distinguished their relative importance or established their role in long-term geomorphic change, nutrient retention, and connectivity with downstream systems. We evaluated the ability of 3 mechanisms (evapotranspiration focusing [EF], differential hydrologic exchange [DHE], and particulate nutrient redistribution [PNR]) to explain spatial patterns of P retention and function in the Everglades (Florida, USA). We used field measurements in sloughs and on slightly higher, more densely vegetated ridges to quantify P fluxes attributable to the 3 mechanisms. EF does not explain Everglades nutrient retention or P concentrations on ridges and in sloughs. However, DHE resulting from different periods of groundwater-surface-water connectivity across topographic elements is the primary cause of elevated P concentrations on ridges and completely explains interpatch differences in long-term P accumulation rates. With historical flow velocities, which were an order of magnitude higher than at present, PNR would have further increased the interpatch difference in long-term P retention rates nearly 2-fold. In conclusion, DHE and PNR are the dominant drivers of nutrient patchiness in the Everglades and are hypothesized to be important in P-limited river and floodplain corridors globally.Show less"

We describe the properties and scaling patterns of river network topology across the contiguous United States: how lake/reservoir abundance, median lake/reservoir size, and median lake/reservoir spacing change with river size. Typically, lake/reservoir abundance decreases, median lake/reservoir size increases, but median lake/reservoir spacing is uniform across river size. There is a characteristic lake/reservoir size of 0.01-0.05km(2) and a characteristic lake/reservoir spacing of 1-5km that shifts to 27-61km in larger rivers. Climate explains more of the variance in river network topology than both glacial history and constructed reservoirs. Our results provide conceptual models for building river network topologies to assess how lake/reservoir abundance, size, and spacing effect the transport, storage, and cycling of water, materials, and organisms across networks.Plain Language Summary Rivers and lakes/reservoirs serve different hydrologic, ecologic, and economic roles and are often studied as separate systems. Yet there are many lakes/reservoirs connected to rivers and this connectivity has profound impacts on sediment storage and transport, biogeochemical cycles, and aquatic habitat in both rivers and lakes/reservoirs. Defining the topology of river networks is critical for understanding these processes across entire networks of connected rivers and lakes/reservoirs. We defined river network topology by scaling the abundance, size, and spacing of lakes/reservoirs with river size and identified broadscale controls of network topology.Show less"

In the Athabasca Oil Sands Region of Alberta this is challenging because the Athabasca River is incised directly into bitumen saturated sands of the McMurray Formation, and other saline Cretaceous and Devonian formations. This study compares the geochemical and isotopic composition of porewater sampled from the alluvial sediment beneath the Athabasca River with regional groundwater data to identify the geological origin of these saline groundwaters, and improve characterization of natural background sources of solutes entering the Athabasca River. Terrain conductivity surveys conducted along the Athabasca River were used to identify areas with evidence of saline groundwater discharge. Porewater samples were obtained from the alluvial sediment using drive point piezometers installed between 1 and 3 m below the water- sediment interface and were analyzed for 8 delta O-18, delta H-2 , delta S-34-SO4, delta O-18-SO4 ,Sr-87/Sr-86, delta C-13-DIC, delta C-13-DOC, H-3, and C-14. The porewater in the alluvial sediment showed variable degrees of mixing with the overlying Athabasca River water, but the geochemical and isotopic composition in zones 1, 3 and 5 are consistent with discharge of saline groundwater from Cretaceous or Devonian units. The low percentages of modern carbon, and delta O-18, delta H-2, delta S-34-SO4, delta O-1(8)-SO4, and Sr-87/Sr-86 signatures in the deepest porewater samples from Zones 1, 3 and 5 indicate glaciogenic water with high total dissolved solids originating from Devonian sourced solutes. Theses saline groundwater discharge zones occur where higher horizontal hydraulic gradients coincide with areas of higher salinity in the adjacent Cretaceous and Devonian aquifers, and areas with vertical connectivity with underlying Devonian aquifers. The results of this study demonstrate the influence of groundwater-surface water interactions and saline bedrock formation water discharge to water quality along some reaches of the Athabasca River which need to be considered in monitoring and water management strategies.Show less"

Two hypotheses provided the background for our study: (a) is the macrophyte vegetation of large, permanently connected branches significantly separated from that of the main river channel; (b) is the macrophyte composition of the Danube main stem significantly altered when the river divides into the three large navigable Delta channels. Water bodies considered were two contiguous sections of the main river channel, two large branches remaining from the historical floodplain, and the three main Delta channels. We quantified macrophyte diversity and floristic variation. Our data set was prepared from the MIDCC-project data base, in which macrophyte occurrence, abundance and habitat parameters are stored for contiguous survey units of the whole Danube river corridor. Field survey method followed that of Kohler and the European Standard EN14184. Results confirmed our first hypothesis: permanently connected side branches still support significantly different macrophyte assemblages, making them important indicators of floodplain connectivity. The diversion of the Danube into its three large navigable delta channels significantly alters the macrophyte vegetation from the c. 300 km of main stem up-river, substantially supporting our second hypothesis. Our results largely enhance the knowledge on aquatic plant biodiversity in the eu-potamal Danube, forming a solid base for long-term studies. We also discuss the relevance of our results regarding the ecological, as well as the conservational, quality of rivers and their floodplains.Show less"

Although rivers have a small global surface area, they contribute substantially to worldwide greenhouse gas emissions through microbially mediated processes within the river hyporheic zone. Despite this importance, research linking microbial and viral communities to specific biogeochemical reactions is still nascent in these sediment environments. To survey the metabolic potential and gene expression underpinning carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in river sediments, we collected an integrated data set of 33 metagenomes, metaproteomes, and paired metabolomes. We reconstructed over 500 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), which we dereplicated into 55 unique, nearly complete medium- and high-quality MAGs spanning 12 bacterial and archaeal phyla. We also reconstructed 2,482 viral genomic contigs, which were dereplicated into 111 viral MAGs (vMAGs) of >10 kb in size. As a result of integrating gene expression data with geochemical and metabolite data, we created a conceptual model that uncovered new roles for microorganisms in organic matter decomposition, carbon sequestration, nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification. We show how these metabolic pathways, integrated through shared resource pools of ammonium, carbon dioxide, and inorganic nitrogen, could ultimately contribute to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes from hyporheic sediments. Further, by linking viral MAGs to these active microbial hosts, we provide some of the first insights into viral modulation of river sediment carbon and nitrogen cycling.IMPORTANCE Here we created HUM-V (hyporheic uncultured microbial and viral), an annotated microbial and viral MAG catalog that captures strain and functional diversity encoded in these Columbia River sediment samples. Demonstrating its utility, this genomic inventory encompasses multiple representatives of dominant microbial and archaeal phyla reported in other river sediments and provides novel viral MAGs that can putatively infect these. Furthermore, we used HUM-V to recruit gene expression data to decipher the functional activities of these MAGs and reconstruct their active roles in Columbia River sediment biogeochemical cycling. Ultimately, we show the power of MAG-resolved multi-omics to uncover interactions and chemical handoffs in river sediments that shape an intertwined carbon and nitrogen metabolic network. The accessible microbial and viral MAGs in HUM-V will serve as a community resource to further advance more untargeted, activity-based measurements in these, and related, freshwater terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems.Show less"
43,"Rathore, SS",May 2021 ,On the Reliability of Parameter Inferences in a Multiscale Model for Transport in Stream Corridors,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Nonreacting tracer tests capture information about physical processes in transient storage zones including the hyporheic zone (HZ). However, reliably extracting this information from breakthrough curves (BTCs) and distinguishing the effects of in-channel dispersion and transient storage are well-known challenges. Using BTCs from a nonreacting tracer test monitored at multiple locations, we explore ways for reliable parameter estimations. The identifiability of parameters is greatly influenced by the choice of forward and inverse modeling frameworks in addition to the quality of the data. Our forward model is a recently proposed multiscale model that uses subgrid transport models written in the Lagrangian form to represent transport along a diverse set of HZ pathways with a shape-free distribution of travel times. Joint distributions of HZ and channel parameters are estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. Numerical experiments show ambiguity between channel dispersion and HZ transport when the reach length is too short to allow significant solute-HZ interaction, the observation period is too brief to observe the tailing behavior, or the solute source is spread in time. In contrast, we obtained reliable parameter estimates by simultaneously fitting BTCs observed at different locations in the test reach using a single set of HZ parameters and section-specific channel areas and dispersion coefficients.

The sample was permitted to stand for 1 h and then passed through an anion-exchange column(Bio-Rad, AGI-X8, 100 similar to 200 mesh, F form, 3 g) at a flow rate of about 1 cm(3) min(-1). The boron adsorbed on the ion exchange column was at a flow rate of about 1 cm(3) min(-1) washed with 20 cm(3) of 1 mol dm(-3) nitric acid, and then eluted with 20 cm(3) of 6.5 mol dm(-3) nitric acid. After the effluent was collected in a 100 cm(3) quartz beaker, 10 cm(3) of 1.47 mol dm(-3) H3PO4 was added and evaporated to about 2 cm(3) on a hotplate. Any organic materials in the affluent were decomposed with mixed H3PO4-HClO4-HNO3. The content in the beaker was then transfered a 25 cm(3) PTFE standard flask, and diluted to the mark with water. The boron contents were determined by ICP-AES(182.6 nm). The present method was successfully applied to the analysis of standard reference materials(JAC0032) and to samples from Doshi river. The determination of boron in the standard reference materials showed good agreement and precision with already published values. The boron contents in the upper, middle and lower reaches in the river were 3.5 +/- 0.1 mug/l (n = 3), 5.1 +/- 0.1 mug/l (n = 6) and 9.4 +/- 0.6 mug/l (n = 4), respectively.Show less"
45,"Heindel, RC",Feb 2021 ,"Diatoms in Hyporheic Sediments Trace Organic Matter Retention and Processing in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"In low-nutrient streams in cold and arid ecosystems, the spiraling of autochthonous particulate organic matter (POM) may provide important nutrient subsidies downstream. Because of its lability and the spatial heterogeneity of processing in hyporheic sediments, the downstream transport and fate of autochthonous POM can be difficult to trace. In Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valley (MDV) streams, any POM retained in the hyporheic zone is expected to be derived from surface microbial mats that contain diatoms with long-lasting silica frustules. We tested whether diatom frustules can be used to trace the retention of autochthonous POM in the hyporheic zone and whether certain geomorphic locations promote this process. The accumulation of diatom frustules in hyporheic sediments, measured as biogenic silica, was correlated with loss-on-ignition organic matter and sorbed ammonium, suggesting that diatoms can be used to identify locations where POM has been retained and processed over long timescales, regardless of whether the POM remains intact. In addition, by modeling the upstream sources of hyporheic diatom assemblages, we found that POM was predominantly derived from N-fixing microbial mats of the genus Nostoc. In terms of spatial variability, we conclude that the hyporheic sediments adjacent to the stream channel that are regularly inundated by daily flood pulses are where the most POM has been retained over long timescales. Autochthonous POM is retained in hyporheic zones of low-nutrient streams beyond the MDVs, and we suggest that biogenic silica and diatom composition can be used to identify locations where this transfer is most prevalent.Show less"
46,"Vergnes, JP",Nov 2018 ,Impact of river water levels on the simulation of stream-aquifer exchanges over the Upper Rhine alluvial aquifer (France/Germany),HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"This study aims to assess the sensitivity of river level estimations to the stream-aquifer exchanges within a hydrogeological model of the Upper Rhine alluvial aquifer (France/Germany), characterized as a large shallow aquifer with numerous hydropower dams. Two specific points are addressed: errors associated with digital elevation models (DEMs) and errors associated with the estimation of river level. The fine-resolution raw Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission dataset is used to assess the impact of the DEM uncertainties. Specific corrections are used to overcome these uncertainties: a simple moving average is applied to the topography along the rivers and additional data are used along the Rhine River to account for the numerous dams. Then, the impact of the river-level temporal variations is assessed through two different methods based on observed rating curves and on the Manning formula. Results are evaluated against observation data from 37 river-level points located over the aquifer, 190 piezometers, and a spatial database of wetlands. DEM uncertainties affect the spatial variability of the stream-aquifer exchanges by inducing strong noise and unrealistic peaks. The corrected DEM reduces the biases between observations and simulations by 22 and 51% for the river levels and the river discharges, respectively. It also improves the agreement between simulated groundwater overflows and observed wetlands. Introducing river-level time variability increases the stream-aquifer exchange range and reduces the piezometric head variability. These results confirm the need to better assess river levels in regional hydrogeological modeling, especially for applications in which stream-aquifer exchanges are important.Show less"
47,"Torres, KMM",Jun 2016 ,Taxonomic and functional organization in metacommunity structure of stream-fish assemblages among and within river basins in Texas,AQUATIC ECOLOGY,"Metacommunities are spatially structured communities linked by dispersal. They provide a connection between local community assembly and regional-level processes. One of the more widely used methods to address questions related to metacommunity concepts is those that characterize elements of metacommunity structure by quantifying aspects of coherence, species turnover, and boundary clumping. In this study, we used this approach to study the spatial ecology of freshwater fishes in Texas. Stream-fish assemblages in Texas provide an excellent opportunity to examine the patterns of metacommunity structure due to the number of drainages that empty directly into the Gulf of Mexico, which minimizes the likelihood of dispersal between basins while allowing for longitudinal movement within basins. We used fisheries data published by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and from the North American Water Quality Association, which consisted of 94 sampling localities distributed across 18 river basins and 11 ecoregions. To examine within-basin patterns, we focused only on the Brazos, Colorado, and Trinity rivers because of the number of sites within each of these basins. From a taxonomic standpoint, we consistently observed Clementsian patterns regardless of whether it was among or within river basins, whereas we mostly observed Gleasonian patterns from a functional perspective. Only one functional group was found at all sites in each of the three main river basins, which consisted of invertivores with an equilibrium life-history strategy. Various bioclimatic variables were significantly correlated with metacommunity structure, but these correlations differed between taxonomic and functional organization and differed depending on which river basin was considered. The results of this study support previous findings that species composition and functional traits relate to environmental gradients, but further our understanding by providing additional evidence that species sorting processes are the dominant structuring mechanisms.Show less"
48,"Painter, SL",Oct 2018 ,Multiscale Framework for Modeling Multicomponent Reactive Transport in Stream Corriders,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Travel time-based representations of transport, a highly successful strategy for modeling conservative tracer transport in stream corridors, are extended to accommodate multicomponent reactive transport. Specifically, convolution representations used to model exchange of solute with the hyporheic zone are shown to be equivalent to solving one-dimensional subgrid models in Lagrangian form coupled to the advection dispersion equation for the stream channel. Unlike the convolution-based representations of previous travel time-based stream transport models, the subgrid model generalizes to include multicomponent reactive transport with general nonlinear reactions. An example involving biomass growth, the establishment of redox zonation, and the resulting impact on denitrification rates demonstrate reach-scale application of the new approach. Although simplified, those example simulations show some of the key phenomena associated with hyporheic zone denitrification that are not represented with conventional first-order estimates.Show less"
49,"Covino, T",Dec 16 2011 ,Stream-groundwater exchange and hydrologic turnover at the network scale,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of water between streams and groundwater can influence stream water quality, hydrologic mass balances, and attenuate solute export from watersheds. We used conservative tracer injections (chloride, Cl-) across 10 stream reaches to investigate stream water gains and losses from and to groundwater at larger spatial and temporal scales than typically associated with hyporheic exchanges. We found strong relationships between reach discharge, median tracer velocity, and gross hydrologic loss across a range of stream morphologies and sizes in the 11.4 km(2) Bull Trout Watershed of central ID. We implemented these empirical relationships in a numerical network model and simulated stream water gains and losses and subsequent fractional hydrologic turnover across the stream network. We found that stream gains and losses from and to groundwater can influence source water contributions and stream water compositions across stream networks. Quantifying proportional influences of source water contributions from runoff generation locations across the network on stream water composition can provide insight into the internal mechanisms that partially control the hydrologic and biogeochemical signatures observed along networks and at watershed outlets.Show less"
