0,"Wu, GP",Nov 2017 ,Seasonal Water Exchanges between China's Poyang Lake and Its Saucer-Shaped Depressions on River Deltas,WATER,"The saucer-shaped depressions located at the river deltas of Poyang Lake are typical floodplain shallow sub-lakes subject to river-lake connection or isolation. The hydrological connectivity between these depressions and the main lake has a major influence on the hydrologic function and ecological integrity of the lake-floodplain and associated wetland habitats. This study explored the water level fluctuations and water exchange processes between the Poyang Lake and three typical saucer-shaped depressions, using a 30-min temporal resolution of water level observations during 2015-2016. Our results showed that the water level correlation and hydrological connectivity between the main lake and its depressions displayed a strong seasonal and spatial signal. Temporally, the rainfall significantly influences the seasonality and frequency of water level fluctuations both in the main lake and the depressions. The correlation coefficient of the water level ordered from high to low occurred during the high-water period, the rising-water period, the falling-water period and the low-water period, respectively. Spatially, depressions with a shorter connection duration to the main lake are located at higher local elevation and at larger geographical distance from the main lake. Finally, we also discussed the implications of these findings and possible factors that could have caused these particular water regime characteristics and water exchange processes.Show less"
1,"Allen, GH",Aug 10 2018 ,Global extent of rivers and streams,SCIENCE,"The turbulent surfaces of rivers and streams are natural hotspots of biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere. At the global scale, the total river-atmosphere flux of trace gasses such as carbon dioxide depends on the proportion of Earth's surface that is covered by the fluvial network, yet the total surface area of rivers and streams is poorly constrained. We used a global database of planform river hydromorphology and a statistical approach to show that global river and stream surface area at mean annual discharge is 773,000 +/- 79,000 square kilometers (0.58 +/- 0.06%) of Earth's nonglaciated land surface, an area 44 +/- 15% larger than previous spatial estimates. We found that rivers and streams likely play a greater role in controlling land-atmosphere fluxes than is currently represented in global carbon budgets.Show less"
2,"Courtice, G",Jul 2014 ,Stream modifications to enhance system connectivity for fish habitat compensation: a case study in the Barrenlands region of Canada,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,"This study examines stream modification efforts to increase the productive capacity of an isolated system of three small lakes in the Barrenlands region of Arctic Canada by enhancing system connectivity. The lakes' outlet streams were modified to create conditions favourable for fish passage and thereby promote migration among the lakes and the large lake into which they drain. Gabion step pools (in two streams) and a nature-like choke-and-pool structure (in one stream) were installed. Two years of post-construction hydraulics data were compared to data collected for two years prior to construction to determine the efficacy of the various stream modifications. Initial evaluations indicated unsuccessful performance of gabion step pools, so after the first year, they were retrofitted with boulders to increase flow depth, restrict discharge, improve flow duration, and create unimpeded connections rather than sudden drops. Variation of lake levels and duration, variability, and depth of stream flow indicated that outlet geometry and lake catchment area should be important considerations when enhancing connectivity for fish migration in ephemeral systems. A narrow, rectangular cross-section was deemed effective for increasing flow depth while decreasing discharge, resulting in increased duration of flows. Catchment area was an effective indicator of a headwater lake's potential response to connectivity enhancements. Smaller catchments may provide inadequate runoff to sustain minimum storage requirements for enhanced connectivity. Our findings should advance the knowledge of headwater system hydraulics in the Barrenlands and assist in designing future fish habitat compensation projects on similar systems.Show less"
3,"Xiao, CG",Jun 2019 ,"Effects of river sinuosity on the self-purification capacity of the Shiwuli River, China",WATER SUPPLY,"This study focused on the correlation between river sinuosity and self-purification capacity, using the Shiwuli River in Hefei, China, as a case. Through field monitoring, the reduction rate of each pollutant per unit length of river reach and its correlation with the corresponding sinuosity were analysed. The results show that river sinuosity has different degrees of positive correlation with the growth rate of dissolved oxygen (DO) and the reduction rates of total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP). River sinuosity needs to be above 1.42 to ensure the river's basic self-purification capability. We also discuss the mechanism of river sinuosity on water body self-purification and propose the increase in river sinuosity to improve the river's capacity to purify water from pollutants. This measure could enhance the growth rate of DO, the longitudinal hyporheic exchange flow, and the action time of other basic self-purification factors of the river. This study could help scientific decision-making in river reconstruction planning in the process of urbanization in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China.Show less"
4,"Singh, NK",Aug 15 2018 ,Simulating stream response to floodplain connectivity and revegetation from reach to watershed scales: Implications for stream management,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Natural-infrastructures (e.g., floodplains) can offer multiple ecosystem services (ES), including flood-resilience and water quality improvement. In order to maintain these ES, state and non-profit organizations consider various stream interventions, including increased floodplain connectivity and revegetation. However, the effect of these interventions is rarely quantified. We build a hydraulic model to simulate the influence of above-mentioned interventions on stream power and water depth during 5 yr and 100 yr flood return-intervals for two watersheds in Vermont, USA. Simulated revegetation of floodplains increased water depth and decreased stream power, whereas increasing connectivity resulted in decline of both responses. Combination of increased connectivity and floodplain revegetation showed greatest reduction in stream-power suggesting that interventions may influence stream response in diverse ways. Across all three interventions, 14% and 48% of altered reaches showed increase in stream power and water depth over baseline, indicating that interventions may lead to undesirable outcomes and their apparent effectiveness can vary with the measure chosen for evaluation. Interventions also influenced up to 16% of unaltered reaches (i.e., in which no interventions were implemented), indicating the consequences of interventions can spread both up and downstream. Multivariate analysis showed that up to 50% of variance in stream response to interventions is attributable to characteristics of reaches, indicating that these characteristics could mediate the effectiveness of interventions. This study offers a framework to evaluate the potential ES provided by natural infrastructure. All stream interventions involve tradeoffs among responses and between target and non-target areas, so careful evaluation is therefore needed to compare benefits and costs among interventions. Such assessments can lead to more effective management of stream-floodplain ecosystems both in Vermont and elsewhere. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
5,"Yang, S",Aug 18 2021 ,Hortonian Scaling of Coupled Hydrological and Biogeochemical Responses Across an Intensively Managed River Basin,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Structural and functional attributes across fractal river networks have been characterized by well-established and consistent hierarchical, Hortonian scaling patterns. In most of the global river basins, spatial patterns of human settlements also conform to similar hierarchical scaling. However, emergent spatial hierarchical patterns and scaling of heterogeneous anthropogenic nutrient loads over a river basin are less known. As a case study, we examined here a large intensely managed river basin in Germany (Weser River; 46K km(2); 8M population). Archived data for point-/diffuse-sources of total Phosphorus (P-tot) input loads were combined with numerical and analytical model simulations of coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes for in-stream P-tot removal at the network scale. We find that P-tot input loads scale exponentially over stream-orders, with the larger scaling constant for point-source loads from urban agglomerations compared to those for diffuse-source contributions from agricultural and forested areas. These differences in scaling patterns result from hierarchical self-organization of human settlements, and the associated clustering of large-scale, altered land-cover. Fraction of P-tot loads removed through in-stream biogeochemical processes also manifests Hortonian scaling, consistent with predictions of an analytical model. Our analyses show that while smaller streams are more efficient in P-tot removal, in larger streams the magnitude of P-tot loads removed is higher. These trends are consistent with inverse scaling of nutrient removal rate constant with mean discharge, and downstream clustering of larger cumulative input loads. Analyses of six nested sub-basins within the Weser River Basin also reveal similar scaling patterns. Our findings are useful for projecting likely water-quality spatial patterns in similar river basins in Germany, and Central Europe. Extensions and generalizations require further examination of diverse basins with archetype spatial heterogeneities in anthropogenic pressures and hydroclimatic settings.Show less"
6,"Boykov, SY",Apr 2020 ,Evaluation of Irreversibility and Optimal Organization of an Integrated Multi-Stream Heat Exchange System,JOURNAL OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS,"This work proposes a structure synthesis and surface distribution algorithm in a heat exchange system for the case when all heat capacity rates and inlet temperatures of the hot streams are constant, while cold streams also have outlet temperatures set. The algorithm includes the possibility of changing the phase state of the contacting streams. The synthesis is based on minimization of dissipation for a given total heat load in the form of minimum total contact surface area, which again correlates with the cost of the heat exchange system. The proposed algorithm can be considered to follow a thermodynamic rationale and as development of pinch analysis.Show less"
7,"Gayraud, S",2002 ,The clogging of stream beds: A review of mechanisms and consequences on habitats and macroinvertebrate communities.,BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE,"The clogging refers to deposition and infiltration of fine organic and inorganic sediments downward within the hyporheic zone. In this review, we presented clogging mechanisms and their spatio-temporal variability in the context of a global stream functioning. Clogging modifies stream bottom and interstitial habitats characteristics and reduces the exchange of water and dissolved substances between the stream surface and the hyporheic zone. Modifications of substrate structure, substrate stability, oxygen and trophic resources and predator influence lead to changes in community structure. In a first step, drift increases whereas the invertebrate abundance drops. In a second step, likelihood to survive, growing, standing crop and productivity are affected. Coarse substrate adapted assemblages are progressively replaced by invertebrates adapted to fine sediments. The studies about consequences of clogging on the hyporheos are scarce, but the major role of the hyporheos on the dynamic of streams suggests that its alteration would strongly decrease the stream resilience capacity after disturbances.Show less"
8,"Brookshire, ENJ",Sep 2005 ,Coupled cycling of dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon in a forest stream,ECOLOGY,"Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is an abundant but poorly understood pool of N in many ecosystems. We assessed DON cycling in a N-limited headwater forest stream via whole-ecosystem additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and labile dissolved organic matter (DOM), hydrologic transport and biogeochemical modeling, and laboratory experiments with native sediments. We sampled surface and subsurface waters to understand how interaction among hydrologic exchange, DIN, DON, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influence stream N losses at summer baseflow. Added DON was taken up rapidly from the water column at rates exceeding DOC and DIN. A significant fraction of this DON was mineralized and nitrified. Combined DON and NO3-N uptake lengths resulted in spiraling lengths of similar to 210 m, suggesting the potential for multiple. transformations of labile N loads within catchment boundaries. Simultaneous addition of DIN increased DOM uptake, but more so for C, resulting in an upward shift in the C:N ratio of uptake. Sediment incubations also showed a strong biotic influence on DOC and DON dynamics. Despite efficient uptake of added DOM, background DON and high molecular mass DOC concentrations increased downstream, resulting in higher DOM loads than could be accounted for by groundwater discharge and suggesting net release of less bioavailable forms from the channel/hyporheic zone. At the same time, subsurface DOM was characterized by very low C:N ratios and a disproportionately large DON pool despite rapid hydrologic mixing with dilute and high C:N ratio surface waters. Analysis of expected DON loads from conservative hyporheic fluxes indicated that watershed losses of DON would have been seven times greater in the absence of apparent benthic demand, suggesting tight internal cycling of subsurface DON. Our study further demonstrates the potential for significant transformation of N in headwater streams before export to downstream ecosystems.Show less"
9,"Ren, JH",Dec 15 2004 ,Stream-subsurface exchange of zinc in the presence of silica and kaolinite colloids,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"The mobility of sorbing contaminants in surface waters often depends strongly on associations with sediments, including both fine suspended particles and stationary bed sediments. Hydrodynamic flow coupling causes an exchange of dissolved and suspended substances between streams and underlying pore waters (hyporheic exchange). As a result, the fate of many pollutants is expected to be greatly influenced by the flux of colloids and contaminants across the stream-subsurface interface and the interactions of both types of substances with the bed sediments. Herein, we present experimental results on the stream-subsurface exchange of zinc in the presence of colloidal silica and kaolinite in a laboratory flume. We also apply a process-based theoretical model to predict the coupled transport of colloids and reactive solutes. Model input parameters were obtained using independent batch and column experiments. Zinc immobilization in the bed was found to be significantly greater in the presence of kaolinite than in the presence of colloidal silica. Model predictions indicated that there were two distinct reasons for the greater zinc immobilization in the presence of kaolinite: zinc sorbed more strongly to kaolinite than to silica, and kaolinite particles also deposited more readily in the streambed than did silica colloids. Model simulations were found to be highly dependent on the colloid size distribution. When the colloids had a bimodal distribution, colloidal-phase contaminant transport occurred primarily on the finer fraction, but bulk colloid deposition was dominated by removal of the coarser fraction.Show less"
10,"Lautz, LK",Dec 15 2007 ,The effect of transient storage on nitrate uptake lengths in streams: an inter-site comparison,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Surface water-groundwater interaction in the hyporheic zone may enhance biogeochemical cycling in streams, and it has been hypothesized that streams exchanging more water with the hyporheic zone should have more rapid nitrate utilization. We used simultaneous conservative solute and nitrate addition tracer tests to measure transient storage (which includes hyporheic exchange and in-stream storage) and the rate of nitrate uptake along three reaches within the Red Canyon Creek watershed, Wyoming. We calibrated a one-dimensional transport model, incorporating transient storage (OTIS-P), to the conservative solute breakthrough curves and used the results to determine the degree of transient storage in each reach. The nitrate uptake length was quantified from the exponential decrease in nitrate concentration with distance during the tracer tests. Nitrate uptake along the most downstream reach of Red Canyon Creek was rapid (turnover time k(c)(-1) = 32 min), compared with nitrate uptake reported in other studies (k(c)(-1) = 12 to 551 min), but other sites within the watershed showed little nitrate retention or loss. The uptake length S-w-NO3- for the most downstream reach was 500 m and the mass transfer coefficient V-f-NO3- was 6.3 m min(-1). Results from 15 other nitrate-addition tracer tests were used to create a regression model relating transient storage and measures of stream flow to nitrate uptake length. The model, which includes specific discharge and transient storage area, explains almost half the variability in nitrate uptake length (adjusted R-2 = 0.44) and is most effective for comparing sites with very different stream characteristics. Although large differences in specific discharge and storage zone area explain inter-site differences in nitrate uptake, other unmeasured variables, such as available organic carbon and microbial community composition, are likely important for predicting differences in nitrate uptake between sites with similar specific discharge rates and storage zone areas, such as when making intra-site comparisons.

11,"Rolls, ET",,Auditory cortical connectivity in humans,CEREBRAL CORTEX,"To understand auditory cortical processing, the effective connectivity between 15 auditory cortical regions and 360 cortical regions was measured in 171 Human Connectome Project participants, and complemented with functional connectivity and diffusion tractography. 1. A hierarchy of auditory cortical processing was identified from Core regions (including A1) to Belt regions LBelt, MBelt, and 52; then to PBelt; and then to HCP A4. 2. A4 has connectivity to anterior temporal lobe TA2, and to HCP A5, which connects to dorsal-bank superior temporal sulcus (STS) regions STGa, STSda, and STSdp. These STS regions also receive visual inputs about moving faces and objects, which are combined with auditory information to help implement multimodal object identification, such as who is speaking, and what is being said. Consistent with this being a ""what"" ventral auditory stream, these STS regions then have effective connectivity to TPOJ1, STV, PSL, TGv, TGd, and PGi, which are language-related semantic regions connecting to Broca's area, especially BA45. 3. A4 and A5 also have effective connectivity to MT and MST, which connect to superior parietal regions forming a dorsal auditory ""where"" stream involved in actions in space. Connections of PBelt, A4, and A5 with BA44 may form a language-related dorsal stream.Show less"
12,"Karadurmus, E",Apr 2004 ,Dynamic simulation and parameter estimation in river streams,ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,"Predictions and quality management issues for environmental protection in river basins rely on water-quality models. The key step in model calibration and verification is obtaining the right values of the model parameters. Current practice in model calibration is such that the reaction coefficients are adjusted by trial-and-error until the predicted values and measured data are within a pre-selected margin of error, and this may be a very time consuming task. This study is directed towards developing a parameter estimation strategy coupled with the simulation of water quality models so that the heavy burden of finding reaction rate coefficients is overcome. Dynamic mass balances for different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus, biological oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, coliforms, nonconservative constituent and algae were written for a single computational element. The model parameters conforming to those in QUAL2E water quality model were estimated by a nonlinear multi-response parameter estimation strategy coupled with a stiff integrator. Yesihrmak river basin around the city of Amasya in Turkey served as the prototype system for the model development. Samples were collected simultaneously from two stations, and concentrations of many water-quality constituents were determined either on-site or in laboratory. This dynamic data was then used for numerical parameter estimation during computer simulation. When the model was simulated with the estimated parameters, it was seen that the model was quite able to predict the dynamics of major water quality constituents. It is concluded that the proposed method shows promise for automatically generating reliable estimates of model parameters.Show less"
13,"Fang, YL",Nov 26 2020 ,High-Performance Simulation of Dynamic Hydrologic Exchange and Implications for Surrogate Flow and Reactive Transport Modeling in a Large River Corridor,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) have environmental significance in riverine ecosystems. Key river channel factors that influence the spatial and temporal variations of HEFs include river stage, riverbed morphology, and riverbed hydraulic conductivity. However, their impacts on HEFs were often evaluated independently or on small scales. In this study, we numerically evaluated the combined interactions of these factors on HEFs using a high-performance simulator, PFLOTRAN, for subsurface flow and transport. The model covers 51 square kilometers of a selected river corridor with large sinuosity along the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington, US. Three years of spatially distributed hourly river stages were applied to the riverbed. Compared to the simulation when riverbed heterogeneity is not ignored, the simulation using homogeneous riverbed conductivity underestimated HEFs, especially upwelling from lateral features, and overestimated the mean residence times derived from particle tracking. To derive a surrogate model for the river corridor, we amended the widely used transient storage model (TSM) for riverine solute study at reach scale with reactions. By treating the whole river corridor as a batch reactor, the temporal changes in the exchange rate coefficient for the TSM were derived from the dynamic residence time estimated from the hourly PFLOTRAN results. The TSM results were evaluated against the effective concentrations in the hyporheic zone calculated from the PFLOTRAN simulations. Our results show that there is potential to parameterize surrogate models such as TSM amended with biogeochemical reactions while incorporating small-scale process understandings and the signature of time-varying streamflow to advance the mechanistic understanding of river corridor processes at reach to watershed scales. However, the assumption of a well-mixed storage zone for TSM should be revisited when redox-sensitive reactions in the storage zones play important roles in river corridor functioning.Show less"
14,"Leach, JA",Feb 28 2011 ,Stream temperature dynamics in two hydrogeomorphically distinct reaches,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The objective of this study was to analyse stream temperature variability during summer in relation to both surface heat exchanges and reach-scale hydrology for two hydrogeomorphically distinct reaches. The study focused on a 1.5-km wildfire-disturbed reach of Fishtrap Creek located north of Kamloops, British Columbia. Streamflow measurements and longitudinal surveys of electrical conductivity and water chemistry indicated that the upper 750 m of the study reach was dominated by flow losses. A spring discharged into the stream at 750 m below the upper reach boundary. Below the spring, the stream was neutral to losing on three measurement days, but gained flow on a fourth day that followed a rain event. Continuous stream temperature measurements typically revealed a downstream warming along the upper 750 m of the study reach on summer days, followed by a pronounced cooling associated with the spring, with little downstream change below the spring. Modelled surface energy exchanges were similar over the upper and lower sub-reaches, and thus cannot explain the differences in longitudinal temperature patterns. Application of a Lagrangian stream temperature model provided reasonably accurate predictions for the upper sub-reach. For the lower sub-reach, accurate prediction required specification of concurrent flow losses and gains as a hydrological boundary condition. These findings are consistent with differences in the hydrogeomorphology of the upper and lower sub-reaches. The modelling exercise indicated that substantial errors in predicted stream temperature can occur by representing stream-surface exchange as a reach-averaged one-directional flux computed from differences in streamflow between the upper and lower reach boundaries. Further research should focus on reliable methods for quantifying spatial variations in reach-scale hydrology. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
15,"Feng, JG",Apr 2021 ,Effect of Hydrological Connectivity on Soil Carbon Storage in the Yellow River Delta Wetlands of China,CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE,"Hydrological connectivity has significant effects on the functions of estuarine wetland ecosystem. This study aimed to examine the dynamics of hydrological connectivity and its impact on soil carbon pool in the Yellow River Delta, China. We calculated the hydrological connectivity based on the hydraulic resistance and graph theory, and measured soil total carbon and organic carbon under four different hydrological connectivity gradients (I 0-0.03, II 0.03-0.06, III 0.06-0.12, IV 0.12-0.39). The results showed that hydrological connectivity increased in the north shore of the Yellow River and the south tidal flat from 2007 to 2018, which concentrated in the mainstream of the Yellow River and the tidal creek. High hydrological connectivity was maintained in the wetland restoration area. The soil total carbon storage and organic carbon storage significantly increased with increasing hydrological connectivity from I to III gradient and decreased in IV gradient. The highest soil total carbon storage of 0-30 cm depth was 5172.34 g/m(2), and organic carbon storage 2764.31 g/m(2) in III gradient. The hydrological connectivity changed with temporal and spatial change during 2007-2018 and had a noticeable impact on soil carbon storage in the Yellow River Delta. The results indicated that appropriate hydrological connectivity, i.e. 0.08, could effectively promote soil carbon storage.Show less"
16,"Guo, F",May 2016 ,Distribution and stable isotopic compositions of organic carbon in surface sediments in hyporheic zone of karst springs,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Frequently exchange of substance and energy in karst hyporheic zone may cause rapidly degeneration of groundwater environment. Hyporheic zone delineation and its nutrients exchange quantification are quite difficult in karst spring. To evaluate the source of organic matter (OM) and its environmental indication, 45 surface sediments were collected in a karst pool to determine the content of grain size, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and stable isotope. C/N ratios showed that 83 % of OM is autochthonous source, but the contribution of OM carried by surface water backflow cannot be ignored. A high C/N ratios zone could be found in the tail of the pool. This is ascribed to surface river backflowing in extremely high water level. delta C-13 of OM ranged from -29.27 to -22.40 %, and they were consistent with isotope of local hydrophyte in the spring. Combined with elemental analysis, isotopic composition, grain size distribution and human activities, detailed water environmental function zones in the pool were defined; especially, the active hyporheic zone was determined. Our data reveal that the nature and distribution of OM are complex and dynamic in a karst hyporheic zone. Organic biogeochemistry may play more important role and drive the evolution of aquatic environment.Show less"
17,"Liu, YL",Dec 2020 ,A method for evaluating the longitudinal functional connectivity of a river-lake-marsh system and its application in China,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The longitudinal functional connectivity of a river-lake-marsh system (RLMS) refers to the actual water-mediated transport of material from upstream to downstream areas along a spatial gradient and is fundamental to understand hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. However, due to a lack of consensus on appropriate data and methods, the quantification of connectivity is still a challenge, especially at the catchment scale. We developed a new method to evaluate longitudinal functional connectivity based on fluxes of materials (water, sediment, and chemicals) along a RLMS. The calculation of fluxes is based on the longitudinal pattern of terrain gradient, which influences transport efficiency, and on contributions from hillslopes, which set the initial spatial template of material loading to the RLMS. We evaluate the contributions from hillslopes to RLMS based on a new modified version of the index of sediment connectivity (IC) proposed by Borselli et al. (2008) and revised by Chartin et al. (2017).We applied this method to the Baiyangdian Basin covering an area of 3.4 x 10(4) km(2) in China and quantified longitudinal functional connectivity during normal, wet, and dry periods(April, July and December) in year 2016. We found that areas with good structural connectivity exhibited poor functional connectivity during the normal and dry periods. Modelling testing with discharge data from hydrological stations and measured chemicals from Baiyangdian Lake was satisfactory in test periods. We conclude that public data and Digital Elevation Model-derived information can be used to reliably map the longitudinal functional connectivity of RLMSs. The proposed method provides a useful tool for monitoring and restoring the longitudinal functional connectivity of RLMSs and our results indicate that efforts aimed at restoring functional connectivity in RLMSs should take into account landscape patterns that can greatly influence fluxes in the watershed.Show less"
18,"Eschbach, D",Feb 28 2017 ,"Thermal-infrared remote sensing of surface water-groundwater exchanges in a restored anastomosing channel (Upper Rhine River, France)",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Ecohydrological processes are a key element to consider in functional river restorations. In the framework of a LIFE+ European restoration program, we have investigated the potential for airborne thermal-infrared remote sensing to map surface water-groundwater exchanges and to identify their driving factors. We focused our attention on anastomosing channels on an artificial island of the Upper Rhine River (Rohrschollen), where a new channel was excavated from the floodplain to reconnect an older channel in its upstream part. These hydraulic engineering works led to an increased inflow from the Rhine Canal. Here, we propose an original data treatment chain to (a) georeference the thermal-infrared images in geographic information system based on visible images, (b) detect and correct data errors, and (c) identify and locate thermal anomalies attributed to groundwater inputs and hyporheic upwellings. Our results, which have been compared to morpho-sedimentary data, show that groundwater upwelling in the new channel is controlled by riffle-pool sequences and bars. This channel is characterized by large bedload transport and morphodynamic activity, forming riffles and bars. In the old channel, where riffle-pool sequences no longer exist, due to impacts of engineering works and insufficient morphodynamic effects of the restoration, thermal anomalies appeared to be less pronounced. Groundwater inputs seem to be controlled by former gravel bars outcropping on the banks, as well as by local thinning of the low-permeability clogging layer on the channel bed.Show less"
19,"Imong, I",Oct 2014 ,Informing Conservation Management About Structural Versus Functional Connectivity: A Case-Study of Cross River Gorillas,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,"Connectivity among subpopulations is vital for the persistence of small and fragmented populations. For management interventions to be effective conservation planners have to make the critical distinction between structural connectivity (based on landscape structure) and functional connectivity (which considers both landscape structure and organism-specific behavioral attributes) which can differ considerably within a given context. We assessed spatial and temporal changes in structural and functional connectivity of the Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli (CRG) population in a 12,000km(2) landscape in the Nigeria-Cameroon border region over a 23-year period, comparing two periods: 19872000 and 2000-2010. Despite substantial forest connections between occupied areas, genetic evidence shows that only limited dispersal occurs among CRG subpopulations. We used remotely sensed land-cover data and simulated human pressure (using a spatially explicit agent-based model) to assess human impact on connectivity of the CRG population. We calculated cost-weighted distances between areas occupied by gorillas as measures of connectivity (structural based on land-cover only, functional based on both land-cover and simulated human pressure). Whereas structural connectivity decreased by 5% over the 23-year period, functional connectivity decreased by 11%, with both decreasing more during the latter compared to the earlier period. Our results highlight the increasing threat of isolation of CRG subpopulations due to human disturbance, and provide insight into how increasing human influence may lead to functional isolation of wildlife populations despite habitat continuity, a pressing and common issue in tropical Africa often not accounted for when deciding management interventions. In addition to quantifying threats to connectivity, our study provides crucial evidence for management authorities to identify actions that are more likely to be effective for conservation of species in human-dominated landscapes. Our approach can be easily applied to other species, regions, and scales. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Show less"
20,"Gallardo, B",Aug 2008 ,Macroinvertebrate patterns along environmental gradients and hydrological connectivity within a regulated river-floodplain,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Flood and flow pulses are primary factors that regulate macroinvertebrate community structure in river-floodplain ecosystems. In order to assess the impacts of these important hydrological events in a regulated Mediterranean river, bimonthly water and macroinvertebrate samples were collected in 2006 in the Middle Ebro River channel and six floodplain wetlands (NE Spain).We found significant differences among the river sites (permanently connected), two constructed wetlands (groundwater seepage) and three natural oxbow lakes (surface connected at 400, 800 and 1200 m(3)/s). River sites were dominated by aquatic worms (e.g., Naididae) and showed a high degree of eutrophication. Constructed wetlands provided new habitat for predatory insects (e.g.,Coenagrion scitulum and Trithemis annulata) that benefited from the absence of fish. Natural oxbow lakes were dominated by crustaceans (e.g., Atyaephyra desmarestii, Procambarus clarkii) and were highly overlapped in Correspondence Analysis. Canonical Correspondence Analysis, coupled with variance partitioning, showed that hydrological connectivity accounted for 28% of the variability in the invertebrate community, followed by physicochemical (10%) and trophic (7%) factors. Differences in frequency and duration of flood pulses in natural oxbow lakes were not enough to generate distinctive macroinvertebrate assemblages in the different wetlands. Analysis of variance showed that richness and total abundance increased with hydrological connectivity, while diversity showed a rather unimodal distribution. Generalized Additive Models indicated that among the measured environmental variables, nitrate concentration strongly affected the composition, abundance and diversity of aquatic communities. Our data indicate that increasing the diversity of water body types in degraded floodplains enhances biodiversity and aids in the functional and ecological recovery of the riverine landscape.Show less"

Sedimentary nutrient transformations are mediated by bacteria in the form of attached biofilms. The influence of microbial metabolic activity on the hydrochemical conditions within the hyporheic zone is poorly understood. We present a hydrobiogeochemical model to assess how the growth of heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass affects the transport and transformation of dissolved nitrogen compounds in bed form-induced hyporheic zones. Coupling between hyporheic exchange, nitrogen metabolism, and biomass growth leads to an equilibrium between permeability reduction and microbial metabolism that yields shallow hyporheic flows in a region with low permeability and high rates of microbial metabolism near the stream-sediment interface. The results show that the bioclogging caused by microbial growth can constrain rates and patterns of hyporheic fluxes and microbial transformation rate in many streams.Show less"
22,"Nian, TK",Jun 2021 ,Numerical investigation on the evolution of landslide-induced river blocking using coupled DEM-CFD,COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS,"This paper presents a two-way coupled discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) scheme to quantitatively investigate the evolution of landslide-induced river blocking. The particle?fluid interaction is considered by exchanging interaction forces, such as drag force, buoyancy force, and lift force, which are essential for describing the evolution of river blocking. The coupled DEM-CFD scheme is first benchmarked by comparing the settling velocities of particles with different diameters with corresponding experiments. The scheme is then employed to investigate the effects of river flow velocity, river water depth, landslide velocity, and landslide volume on the evolution of river blocking. Based on the understanding of the river blocking mechanism, we propose a river blockage coefficient (Ic) to predict the river blocking. The results indicate that river water reduces the mean normal contact force of landslide particles, leading to river water quickly washing them away. The deposit velocity along the direction of the river valley is positively correlated with river water depth and river flow velocity but negatively correlated with the initial landslide velocity and landslide mass volume. The study indicates that when Ic > 1, a river is completely blocked. Otherwise, a river is unblocked or partially blocked.Show less"

We limit this review almost exclusively to Studies of N and P because these elements have been shown to limit productivity in streams. We use the expression nutrient dynamics for Studies that Included some measures of biological processes occurring within streams Prior to the 1970s, instream biological processes were little studied, but through 1985 conceptual advances were made, and 4 types of studies made important contributions to Our understanding of instream processes 1) evidence of increased plant production and decomposition in response to nutrient addition, 2) studies showing a downstream decrease in nutrient concentrations, 3) studies using radioisotopes, and 4) budget studies Beginning with the first paper printed in its first Issue, J-NABS has been the outlet for key papers advancing our understanding of rates and controls of nutrient dynamics in streams. In the first few years, an important review and a conceptual model for conducting experiments to study nutrient dynamics in streams were published in J-NABS In the 1990s, J-NABS published a number of papers on nutrient recycling within algal communities, the role of the hyporheic zone, the role of spawning fish, and the coupling of data from field N-15 additions and a N-cycling model to provide a synoptic view of N dynamics in streams Since 2000, J-NABS has published influential studies on nutrient criteria for streams, rates of and controls on nitrification and denitrification, uptake of stream nutrients by riparian vegetation, and nutrient dynamics in urban streams Nutrient dynamics will certainly continue to be an important topic in J-NABS Topics needing further study include. techniques for study in nutrient dynamics, nutrient dynamics in larger streams and rivers, the ultimate fate of nutrients taken up by plants and microbes in streams, ecological stoichiometry, the effects of climate change, and the role of streams and rivers in nutrient transformation and retention at the landscape scale.Show less"

Improving understanding of how hydrological connectivity varies with respect to surface-water dynamics is an important step to maintain biodiversity in dynamic coastal environments. Using a series of available remote sensing images, we extracted surface-water patches across a 12-year (2006-2017) and assessed the corresponding hydrological connectivity using the landscape connectivity metrics. Furthermore, we identified important surface-water patches serve as connectivity providers in surface-water networks. Particularly, the threshold distance, needed for analysis of hydrological connectivity, was determined by ""Distance- Landscape Connectivity Metrics"" curves. We focused on China's Yellow River Delta (YRD), a globally significant floodplain and coastal wetland. Results showed that hydrological connectivity, fluctuating in a range of 0.0726 to 0.0908 during 2006-2017, varied with the number and spatial distribution of water patches. Our study highlight that water patches in Dawenliu Restoration (DR) could serve as ideal high-priority targets for specific management aimed at maintaining or improving hydrological connectivity. We also found that the suitable threshold distance for analyzing hydrological connectivity of the Yellow River Delta National Natural Reserve (YRDNR) is 500 m.

27,"Marzadri, A",Jul 24 2010 ,Semianalytical analysis of hyporheic flow induced by alternate bars,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We investigate the effects of alternate bar morphology on the hyporheic flow in gravel bed rivers. Our goal is to investigate the relations between residence time distribution of a conservative tracer and the parameters controlling bed form morphology. We assume homogeneous, isotropic or anisotropic hydraulic properties of the streambed sediment and constant flow regime in equilibrium with the bed form, which is considered fixed because its formation timescale is much longer than that of the subsurface flow. Under these assumptions, we solve the in-stream and hyporheic flow fields analytically in a three-dimensional domain. We approximate the former with the shallow water equations and model the latter as a Darcian flow. The two systems are linked through the hydraulic head distribution, which is predicted at the streambed by the surface model and applied as a boundary condition to the hyporheic flow model. We solve the solute transport equation in the hyporheic zone for a conservative tracer by means of particle tracking. Our model predicts that the mean value and variance of the hyporheic residence time depend on the alternate bar amplitude at equilibrium. This result is found to be applicable also to discharges that are lower (70% in our simulations) than the formative and submerge the bars entirely. Moreover, our analysis shows that 95% of the hyporheic flow is confined in a near-bed layer, whose depth is about the width of the channel and shallows from low to steep gradient streams. This causes the hyporheic mean residence time to reach a threshold when the alluvial depth is deeper than the channel width. Our results also show that as the stream slope increases, the streamlines compact near to the streambed, thereby reducing the mean residence time and its variance. Finally, we observe that the hyporheic residence time of pulse injections of passive solutes is lognormally distributed, with the mean value depending in a simple manner on the amplitude of the alternate bars.Show less"

At this study site, in southern United Kingdom, alluvial deposits in the riparian zone can be considered as a patchwork of varying grades and types with an equally varied lateral connectivity. Some display good connection with the river system and others good connection with the groundwater system and, by definition, poorer connectivity with the surface water. By coupling tangential flow fractionation (TFF) with fluorescence analysis we were able to characterize the organic matter in the river and hyporheic zone. There is a significant proportion of particulate and colloidal fluorescent organic matter (FOM) within the river system and at depth within the gravels beneath the river channel. At depth in the hyporheic zone, the surface water inputs are dampened by mixing with deeper groundwater FOM. The shallow (0-0.5 m below river bed) hyporheic zone is highly dynamic as a result of changing surface water inputs from upstream processes. Labile C in the form of protein-like FOM appears to be attenuated preferentially compared to fulvic-like fluorescence in the hyporheic zone compared to the adjacent gravel and sand deposits. These preliminary findings have important implications for understanding nutrient and trace element mobility and attenuation within the groundwater, surface water, and hyporheic zone of permeable Chalk catchments. Fluorescence analysis of dissolved organic matter has been shown to be a useful environmental tracer that can be used in conjunction with other methods to understand GW-SW processes within a permeable Chalk catchment.Show less"
29,"McKnight, DM",Jan 2002 ,In-stream sorption of fulvic acid in an acidic stream: A stream-scale transport experiment,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] The variation of concentration and composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream waters cannot be explained solely on the basis of soil processes in contributing subcatchments. To investigate in-stream processes that control DOC, we injected DOC-enriched water into a reach of the Snake River (Summit County, Colorado) that has abundant iron oxyhydroxides coating the streambed. The injected water was obtained from the Suwannee River (Georgia), which is highly enriched in fulvic acid. The fulvic acid from this water is the standard reference for aquatic fulvic acid for the International Humic Substances Society and has been well characterized. During the experimental injection, significant removal of sorbable fulvic acid occurred within the first 141 m of stream reach. We coinjected a conservative tracer (lithium chloride) and analyzed the results with the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) stream solute transport model to quantify the physical transport mechanisms. The downstream transport of fulvic acid as indicated by absorbance was then simulated using OTIS with a first-order kinetic sorption rate constant applied to the sorbable fulvic acid. The ""sorbable"" fraction of injected fulvic acid was irreversibly sorbed by streambed sediments at rates (kinetic rate constants) of the order of 10(-4)-10(-3) s(-1). In the injected Suwannee River water, sorbable and nonsorbable fulvic acid had distinct chemical characteristics identified in C-13-NMR spectra. The C-13-NMR spectra indicate that during the experiment, the sorbable ""signal"" of greater aromaticity and carboxyl content decreased downstream; that is, these components were preferentially removed. This study illustrates that interactions between the water and the reactive surfaces will modify significantly the concentration and composition of DOC observed in streams with abundant chemically reactive surfaces on the streambed and in the hyporheic zone.Show less"
30,"Zheng, LZ",Aug 2019 ,Ripple Effects: Bed Form Morphodynamics Cascading Into Hyporheic Zone Biogeochemistry,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The water quality and ecosystem health of river corridors depend on the biogeochemical processes occurring in the hyporheic zones (HZs) of the beds and banks of rivers. HZs in riverbeds often form because of bed forms. Despite widespread and persistent variation in river flow, how the discharge- and grain size-dependent geometry of bed forms and how bed form migration collectively and systematically affects hyporheic exchange flux, solute transport, and biogeochemical reaction rates are unknown. We investigated these linked processes through morphodynamically consistent multiphysics numerical simulation experiments. Several realistic ripple geometries based on bed form stability criteria using mean river flow velocity and median sediment grain size were designed. Ripple migration rates were estimated based primarily on the river velocity. The ripple geometries and migration rates were used to drive hyporheic flow and reactive transport models which quantified HZ nitrogen transformation. Results from fixed bed form simulations were compared with matching migrating bed form scenarios. We found that the turnover exchange due to ripple migration has a large impact on reactant supply and reaction rates. The nitrate removal efficiency increased asymptotically with Damkohler number for both mobile and immobile ripples, but the immobile ripple always had a higher nitrate removal efficiency. Since moving ripples remove less nitrogen, and may even be net nitrifying at times, consideration for bed form morphodynamics may therefore lead to reduction of model-based estimates of denitrification. The connection between nitrate removal efficiency and Damkohler number can be integrated into frameworks for quantifying transient, network-scale, HZ nitrate dynamics.Plain Language Summary Sandy riverbeds are very rarely flat. They are typically covered by ripples and dunes. Because of their topography, these ripples and dunes drive variations in water pressure across their surfaces due to deflection, acceleration, and deceleration of the river flow. These pressure variations drive river water to infiltrate into the porous and permeable sediment where pressure is high and exit from the sediment where it is low. This pressure-driven flow, called hyporheic exchange, is critical to the water quality of rivers since it allows river water to undergo biogeochemical reactions that take place within the sediment. Ripples are highly dynamic however and respond readily to changes in river flow. How the migration and variable shape of ripples affect hyporheic exchange and the biogeochemical reactions it dictates is poorly understood and seldom studied. Here we bring concepts from ripple dynamics, river and groundwater hydraulics, and biogeochemistry into a unified modeling framework. The modeling was used to assess the effects of ripple migration on hyporheic zone biogeochemistry. We found that migrating ripples generally process less nitrate, a widespread pollutant, compared to their stationary counterparts. Thus, investigations and applications of hyporheic zone biogeochemical processes should pay attention to the dynamics of ripples.Show less"
31,"Li, H",Jan 2023 ,The Delineation and Ecological Connectivity of the Three Parallel Rivers Natural World Heritage Site,BIOLOGY-BASEL,"Simple Summary The scientific delineation and conservation of natural heritage sites are important steps in maintaining biodiversity and the dynamic stability of ecosystems. We examined the ecological connectivity of the Three Parallel Rivers Natural World Heritage Site, analysed the impact of boundary adjustments on the landscape pattern and ecological connectivity of the area, and explored the relationship between landscape connectivity and species habitat conservation using the Yunnan golden snub-nosed monkey as an environmental indicator species. The ecological connectivity of the Nu-Lancang River area and the Lancang-Jinsha River area was always high. Meanwhile, the improvement in ecological connectivity in the Lancang-Jinsha River area was conducive to the migration and reproduction of large terrestrial animals, including the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, with increasing numbers of populations and individuals. In this study, we found that, in order to improve the level of conservation of heritage sites, the delineation of the effective conservation areas of protected areas and the landscape connectivity between them should be considered in addition to the total area of the protected region. In particular, in addition to large wildlife habitat protection patches, stepping stones and ecological corridor networks should be established for large terrestrial animals. Landscape connectivity refers to the degree of continuity between the spatially structured units of a landscape. Ecological connectivity can characterise the degree to which ecological functional areas are connected in terms of function and ecological processes. In this study, the landscape pattern index and ecosystem service values were used to evaluate the ecological functional resistance of each landscape type, taking the Three Parallel Rivers Natural World Heritage Site as an example and the habitat distribution and population size of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey as a reference. The minimum cost distance model, combined with the barrier impact index (BEI) and ecological connectivity index (ECI), was used to determine the degree of barrier impact on the study area and the ecological connectivity of the core reserve of the heritage site in both 2000 and 2020. The resistances of the different land types and landscape heterogeneity to the ecological function of species migration between the core protected areas of the heritage site were, in descending order, those of the forest, shrubs and grass, water, unused land, cultivated land, and built-up land. In 2020, the study area had a large BEI, with areas such as built-up areas, major roads, the sides of large rivers, and arable land being significant contributors to the blockage of landscape connectivity. The overall landscape connectivity in the study area was generally low, with clear spatial differentiation and a three-column parallel distribution pattern influenced by the topography and landscape. With the adjustment of the core reserve boundaries of the heritage site, the proportion of areas with high connectivity (ECI = 4-5) increased from 11.31% in 2000 to 34.36% in 2020. This increased landscape connectivity was conducive to the migration and reproduction of large terrestrial animals, such as the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey, with increasing numbers of populations and individuals. This study provides theoretical and methodological insights into the delineation and conservation of natural heritage sites and landscape connectivity.Show less"

Although the controls are relatively well understood, their dynamics during periods of hydrologic change is not. We investigate riparian hydraulic gradients over three different time scales in two steep, forested, headwater catchments in Oregon (WS01 and WS03) to determine the potential controls of reach-scale valley slope and cross-sectional valley geometry. Groundwater and stream stage data collected at high spatial and temporal resolutions over a period encompassing a 1.25 year storm and subsequent seasonal baseflow recession indicate that hydraulic gradients in both riparian aquifers exhibit strong persistence of down-valley dominance. Responses to rainfall do not support the simple conceptual models of increased riparian hydraulic gradient toward streams. Hydraulic gradient response in WS01 to both the seasonal baseflow recession and the storm suggested the potential for increased stream-groundwater exchange, but there was less evidence for this in WS03. Results from four constant-rate tracer injections in each stream showed a high baseline level of exchange overall, and both a slight seasonal increase (WS01) and slight decrease (WS03) in the riparian intrusion of tracer-labeled stream water as stream discharge receded. These results indicate that steep headwater valley floors host extensive stream water exchange and very little change in the water table gradients over 3 orders of magnitude of stream discharge.Show less"

In a companion paper, we used flume and hydrodynamic model analysis to develop a refined conceptual model depicting these flow paths with zones of downwelling and upstream-directed flux below the step. The previous coarse conceptual model predicted uniform downstream-directed upwelling below the step. The hydrostatic model accurately predicted the downwelling and upstream-directed fluxes beneath the wave and jump but failed to predict the plunge pool downwelling, which is driven by dynamic pressures. Sensitivity tests varied riverbed topography and water surface profile geometry for a river with 1% slopes, 10 cm flow depths, and 50-150 cm long jets and jumps. The flow paths below the jet-jump region were driven by hydrostatic pressures and were highly sensitive to water surface profile and riverbed topography parameters. Failure to simulate the hydraulic jump caused errors in hyporheic flow path predictions beneath the jump region (similar to 1 m long by similar to 0.5 m deep). If the jump was poorly parameterized, several meters of riverbed flow paths could be erroneously modeled as pointing upstream. The hyporheic zone may contain a spatial mosaic of aerobic and anaerobic waters regulating nutrient transformations and biologic productivity. Accurate parameterization of hydraulic jumps in hyporheic simulation has the potential to improve predictions and explain heterogeneous subsurface flow paths and associated nutrient patterns and ecosystem functions.Show less"

The basis for developing this approach was a preliminary temperature modelling effort on the Virgin River in southwestern Utah during a low-flow period that suggested important components of the energy balance might be missing in the original standard surface-flux temperature model. Possible missing heat fluxes were identified as bed conduction, hyporheic exchange, dead zone warming and exchange and poor representation of the amount of solar radiation entering the water column. To identify and estimate the relative importance of the missing components, a comprehensive data collection effort was developed and implemented. In particular, a method for measuring shortwave radiation behaviour in the water column and an in situ method for separating out bed conduction and hyporheic influences were established. The resulting data and subsequent modelling effort indicate that hyporheic and dead zone heat fluxes are important, whereas solar radiation reflection at the water surface was found to be insignificant. Although bed conduction can be significant in certain rivers, it was found to have little effect on the overall heat budget for this section of the Virgin River.

However, national assessments linking LRC and threatened inland fish species distributions are lacking. Here, we show the trends in the LRC in China over the past 60 years, and quantitatively analyse their implications for threatened inland fish species. The average LRC in China decreased from 93.5% in 1960 to 25.1% in 2018, and the significant deterioration in LRC occurred over the last 20 years. Water resource regions with a high number of threatened fish species are concentrated in southern China, and the degree of threat to inland fish species increases with a decreasing average LRC. A total of 125 inland fish species are threatened by habitat degradation and loss, which is mainly caused by the construction of dams. Intrinsic factors and pollution are two other key threats to fish species in addition to the reduction of LRC. The results of this study can help us better understand the trends in LRC in China and their implications for inland fishes. Meanwhile, this study provides guidance for river management to help preserve biological diversity, including enhancing management of natural reserve areas, establishing ecological compensation mechanisms, preventing biological invasion, and monitoring and evaluation of restoration efforts.Show less"

Treatments were (1) leaf litter (removal vs. addition of naturally fallen, undecomposed leaves), (2) connectivity (meander pond: direct connection; connected pond: indirect connection; and isolated pond; no connection to the stream) and (3) season (dry vs. rainy season). Benthic invertebrate colonization was generally low. Approximatly 78% of all animals were chironomids, with microcrustaceans (cladocerans and harpacticoids) together making up nearly 7%, springtails 3%, caddisfly larvae 2.1%, mayfly larvae 1%. The isolated pond was the least densely colonized habitat, with highly significant lower densities than the two connected ponds (Factorial ANOVAs, p < 0.0001). Season had a strong effect on colonization density, which was significantly higher during the rainy than during the dry period (p=0.001). Significant positive effects of the litter addition treatment on invertebrate colonization were only found during the dry season in the meander pond, where invertebrate densities increased about threefold between litter-free and litter-added treatments (p=0.03). All other combinations showed a slightly negative, non-significant effect of litter addition. As only few specimen of shredding invertebrates were found, we concluded that recently fallen leaf litter seems to be more important as a mechanical matrix for colonization, FPOM retention and cover from predators, than as a food source in riparian ponds of Cerrado streams.Show less"

Our understanding of the natural hydrology and ecology of IRES has greatly improved, but their responses to extreme events such as drought remain a research frontier. In this review, we present the state of the art, knowledge gaps and research directions on droughts in IRES from an ecohydrological perspective. We clarify the definition of droughts in IRES, giving recommendations to promote transferability in how ecohydrological studies characterize droughts in non-perennial stream networks. Based on a systematic search of the literature, we also identify common patterns and sources of variation in the ecological responses of IRES to droughts and provide a roadmap for further research to enable improved understanding and management of IRES during those extreme hydrological events. Confusion in the terminology and the lack of tools to assess the hydrological responses of IRES to drought may have hindered the development of drought research in IRES. We found that 44% of studies confused the term drought with seasonal drying and that those that measure droughts in a transferable way are a minority. Studies on ecological responses to drought in IRES networks are still rare and limited to a few climatic zones and organisms and mainly explored in perennial sections. Our review highlights the need for additional research on this topic to inform IRES management and conservation.Show less"
39,"Wang, ZH",Dec 2016 ,"An integrated model coupling open-channel flow, turbidity current and flow exchanges between main river and tributaries in Xiaolangdi Reservoir, China",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The ever growing importance of sustainable management of reservoir sedimentation has promoted the development and applications of turbidity current models. However, there are few effective and practical models in literature for turbidity currents in a reservoir where the impounded area involves both the main river and its many tributaries. An integrated numerical model coupling open-channel flow, turbidity current and flow exchanges between main river and tributaries is proposed, which can simulate the complex flow and sediment transport in a reservoir where these three physical processes coexist. The model consists of two sets of governing equations for the open-channel flow and turbidity current, which are based on the modified St. Venant equations by taking into account the effect of lateral flow exchanges. These two sets of equations are solved in the finite volume method framework and the solutions are executed in an alternating calculation mode. Different methods are respectively proposed to calculate the discharge of flow exchange caused by free surface gradient and turbidity current intrusion. For the surface-gradient driven flow exchange, a storage cell method, which re-defines the relationship between water level and representative cross-sectional area, is used to update the water level at confluence. For the turbidity current intrusion, a discharge formula is proposed based on the analysis of the energy and momentum transformation in the intruding turbid water body. This formula differs from previous ones in that the effect of tributary bed slope is considered. Two events of water-sediment regulation conducted in the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in 2004 and 2006 were simulated to test the ability of this model. The predicted reservoir drawdown process, the turbidity current evolution and the sediment venting efficiency were in close agreement with the measurements. The necessity to couple the flow exchanges was demonstrated by comparing the performance of the proposed model with different intrusion discharge formulas and the common one-dimensional model neglecting the main river and tributary interaction.

40,"Liang, XY",Mar 2018 ,Spatiotemporal Responses of Groundwater Flow and Aquifer-River Exchanges to Flood Events,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Rapidly rising river stages induced by flood events lead to considerable river water infiltration into aquifers and carry surface-borne solutes into hyporheic zones which are widely recognized as an important place for the biogeochemical activity. Existing studies for surface-groundwater exchanges induced by flood events usually limit to a river-aquifer cross section that is perpendicular to river channels, and neglect groundwater flow in parallel with river channels. In this study, surface-groundwater exchanges to a flood event are investigated with specific considerations of unconfined flow in direction that is in parallel with river channels. The groundwater flow is described by a two-dimensional Boussinesq equation and the flood event is described by a diffusive-type flood wave. Analytical solutions are derived and tested using the numerical solution. The results indicate that river water infiltrates into aquifers quickly during flood events, and mostly returns to the river within a short period of time after the flood event. However, the rest river water will stay in aquifers for a long period of time. The residual river water not only flows back to rivers but also flows to downstream aquifers. The one-dimensional model of neglecting flow in the direction parallel with river channels will overestimate heads and discharge in upstream aquifers. The return flow induced by the flood event has a power law form with time and has a significant impact on the base flow recession at early times. The solution can match the observed hydraulic heads in riparian zone wells of Iowa during flood events.Show less"

Nowadays, information systems produce streaming event logs to record their huge processes. The truncated streaming event log is a big issue in process discovery because it inflicts incomplete traces that make process discovery depict wrong processes in a process model. Earlier research suggested several methods for recovering the truncated streaming event log and none of them utilized Coupled Hidden Markov Model. This research proposes a method that combines Coupled Hidden Markov Model with Double States and the Modification of Viterbi-Backward method for recovering the truncated streaming event log. The first layer of states contains the transition probability of activities. The second layer of states uses patterns for detecting traces which have a low appearance in the event log. The experiment results showed that the proposed method recovered appropriately the truncated streaming event log. These results also have proven that the accuracies of recovered traces obtained by the proposed method are higher than those obtained by the Hidden Markov Model and the Coupled Hidden Markov Model.Show less"

River managers need a simple technique to detect the extent of interstitial clogging and monitor the effectiveness of measures to reduce siltation. We evaluated the use of 30 cm long pine-wood stakes, inserted for 3-6 weeks in the sediments of four French rivers varying in interstitial clogging, to determine the association between changes in the colour of the wood and the adjacent interstitial conditions. There was a general association between depth to interstitial hypoxia and location of the colour change of the wooden stakes from brown to pale grey or black after 3-4 weeks. This change in colour also broadly matched interstitial contents of fine sediment, ammonium, and nitrate although the method could not reliably detect microscale zones of anoxia or short-term changes in dissolved oxygen. Thus, its effectiveness lies in its use as a cheap, simple, and broad-scale indicator for collecting long-term integrated data of interstitial oxygenation in stream sediments with minimal disruption of the gravel bed, and appears an ideal tool for river managers and salmonid fish biologists.Show less"
43,"Tangi, M",Feb 2022 ,"A Dynamic, Network Scale Sediment (Dis)Connectivity Model to Reconstruct Historical Sediment Transfer and River Reach Sediment Budgets",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Modeling network-scale sediment (dis)connectivity and its response to anthropic pressures provides a baseline understanding of river processes and sediment dynamics that can be used to forecast future hydro-morphological changes in river basins. However, this requires a solid understanding of how a system is currently operating, and how it operated in the past. We present the basin-scale, dynamic sediment connectivity model D-CASCADE, which combines concepts of network modeling with empirical sediment transport formulas to quantify spatiotemporal sediment (dis)connectivity in river networks. D-CASCADE accounts for multiple factors affecting sediment transport, such as spatiotemporal variations in hydrological regime, different sediment grain sizes, sediment entrainment and deposition. Add-ons are included in D-CASCADE to model local changes in river geomorphology driven by sediment-induced variations in features such as channel width. We apply D-CASCADE to the well-documented Bega River catchment, NSW, Australia, where significant geomorphic changes to rivers have occurred post European colonization (after 1850s), including widespread channel erosion and sediment mobilization. The Bega catchment provides a useful case study to test D-CASCADE, as original source data on the historical sediment budget are available. By introducing historic drivers of change in the correct chronological sequence, the D-CASCADE model successfully reproduced the timing and magnitude of major phases of sediment transport and associated channel adjustments over the last two centuries. With this confidence, we then ran the model to test how well it performs at estimating future trajectories of basin-scale sediment transport and sediment budgets at the river reach scale.Show less"
44,"Turley, M",Sep 30 2021 ,Quantifying sediment connectivity: Moving toward a holistic assessment through a mixed methods approach,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"The sediment connectivity concept is particularly suitable for tackling complex, multidisciplinary questions through systems thinking. However, it is unclear how to directly measure connectivity, and so proxy variables are often applied by indices to provide estimates. In this study, we critically evaluate a broad range of connectivity indices encompassing structural and functional connectivity as well as hillslope channel coupling. We then discuss their role in providing a more holistic estimation of connectivity within the Tahoma Creek Watershed, WA. Of the 14 km of channel below the glacier front, the upper 6 km (0-6 km) are coupled to the adjacent hillslopes. Coupled reaches correspond to regions with a high proportion of area contributing sediment and relatively high connectivity values, where all measures decrease in the downstream direction. A significant transition occurs near river kilometer 6. Here the valley bottom abruptly widens, deposition occurs, and the hillslopes become decoupled from the active channel. This transitional reach is also identified as a geomorphic hotspot based on the network structure. The lower 8 km of channel downstream of this reach are largely depositional and percent contributing area and connectivity values remain low, eventually reaching a minimum. Despite their limitations, we found each method to provide unique and useful information regarding connectivity. The effect of scale and event magnitude on connectivity is illustrated. We also found vegetation, topographic characteristics, and network structure to be important in high-gradient glacio-volcanic landscapes. The choice of an index will depend on the research objectives, data availability, and the proxy variables that best describe the variability within the defined area.Show less"
45,"Johnson, TAN",Apr 2016 ,Nutrient Retention in Restored Streams and Rivers: A Global Review and Synthesis,WATER,"Excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from human activities have contributed to degradation of coastal waters globally. A growing body of work suggests that hydrologically restoring streams and rivers in agricultural and urban watersheds has potential to increase N and P retention, but rates and mechanisms have not yet been analyzed and compared across studies. We conducted a review of nutrient retention within hydrologically reconnected streams and rivers, including 79 studies. We developed a typology characterizing different forms of stream and river restoration, and we also analyzed nutrient retention across this typology. The studies we reviewed used a variety of methods to analyze nutrient cycling. We performed a further intensive meta -analysis on nutrient spiraling studies because this method was the most consistent and comparable between studies. A meta -analysis of 240 experimental additions of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was synthesized from 15 nutrient spiraling studies. Our results showed statistically significant relationships between nutrient uptake in restored streams and specific watershed attributes. Nitrate uptake metrics were significantly related to watershed surface area, impervious surface cover, and average reach width (p < 0.05). Ammonium uptake metrics were significantly related to discharge, velocity, and transient storage (p < 0.05). SRP uptake metrics were significantly related to watershed area, discharge, SRP concentrations, and chl a concentrations (p < 0.05). Given that most studies were conducted during baseflow, more research is necessary to characterize nutrient uptake during high flow. Furthermore, long-term studies are needed to understand changes in nutrient dynamics as projects evolve over time. Overall analysis suggests the size of the stream restoration (surface area), hydrologic connectivity, and hydrologic residence time are key drivers influencing nutrient retention at broader watershed scales and along the urban watershed continuum.Show less"
46,"Yao, YY",Aug 2015 ,Spatiotemporal variation of river temperature as a predictor of groundwater/surface-water interactions in an arid watershed in China,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Interactions between groundwater and surface water in arid regions are complex, and recharge-discharge processes are often influenced by the hydrological regime, climate and geology. Traditional methods such as hydraulic gradient measuring by piezometers, differential discharge gauging and conservative tracer experiments, are often inadequate to capture the spatial and temporal variation of exchange rates. In this study, the distribution and the size of the overall groundwater inflow zone (GIZ) and the hyporheic inflow zone (HIZ) in the middle Heihe River Basin, northwest China, are characterized, and the relative inflow flux is estimated by high-resolution temperature measurements. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) was used to measure the mixing temperatures of a 5-km reach of streambed with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. The sampling interval was 0.25 m, and the temporal interval was 15 and 10 min at Pingchuan and Banqiao experimental sites, respectively. Two separate measurement periods in Pingchuan (Ping1, Ping2) captured different meteorological and stream-flow conditions. The results show that the number and the size range of the individual HIZs are greater than those of GIZs. Groundwater upwelling (GIZ) causes a larger decrease in river-water temperature with less inflow flux compared with the HIZ. The distribution pattern of HIZs and GIZs is influenced by the hydrodynamics of the river and the hydraulic permeability of the riverbed. High-resolution temperature variation based on DTS is an effective predictor of distributed inflows from groundwater upwelling and hyporheic exchange in an arid region.Show less"
47,"Knowlton, MF",Dec 1997 ,Trophic status of Missouri River floodplain lakes in relation to basin type and connectivity,WETLANDS,"Limnological data were collected over a two-year period from 12 lakes in the Missouri River floodplain in order to evaluate lake trophic status and the influence of basin type and connectivity on nutrient, seston, and phytoplankton dynamics. The lakes were located in west-central Missouri and included eight scour basins formed by levee breaks during a 1993 flood and four older oxbow lakes. The Missouri River was also sampled. Five of the scour basins (connected scours) were inundated by the Missouri River for varying periods during the study. The other lakes (protected lakes) were hydrologically isolated from the river by levees. On the basis of mean total phosphorus (TP-61-282 mu g/L), mean total nitrogen (TN-0.7-2.1 mg/L), mean chlorophyll (CHL-22-67 mu g/L), and mean suspended solids (TSS-16-93 mg/L), all 12 sites were highly eutrophic compared to other lakes in Missouri. Nutrient fractions and seston composition indicated dominance of inorganic nutrients and abiotic seston in the riverine lakes. Maximum concentrations of nutrients and TSS occurred in oxbow lakes during periods of sediment resuspension and in connected scours during floods in spring 1995 and 1996 when connected sites were inundated by the Missouri River. Algal blooms with peak CHL >200 mu g/L occurred sporadically in the oxbow lakes. Similarly large blooms (peak CHL 81-689 mu g/L) occurred in connected scours when low river levels reduced exchange with the river. Reduced connectivity was accompanied by rapid loss of dissolved N and P fractions, especially nitrate. Protected scours had lower average TP, TN, and TSS than the other sites and were less temporally variable.Show less"
48,"Gaona, J",May 15 2019 ,"Identification of groundwater exfiltration, interflow discharge, and hyporheic exchange flows by fibre optic distributed temperature sensing supported by electromagnetic induction geophysics",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Water exchange across the sediment-water interface of streams impresses a characteristic thermal pattern at the interface. The use of fibre optic distributed temperature sensing at the sediment-water interface in a small sand-bed stream identifies such temperature patterns. Groundwater and interflow can be differentiated based on the temporal evolution of temperature patterns. Additionally, sudden temperature changes at the sediment-water interface observed during the transit of floods enable spatial identification of local up and downwelling. Electromagnetic induction geophysics can detect subsurface texture structures that support groundwater-surface water exchange. Our results show that areas of permanent temperature anomalies observed with fibre optic distributed temperature sensing match areas of comparatively homogeneous electrical conductivity. This indicates groundwater discharge and enables differentiating groundwater discharge from interflow and local downwelling.Show less"
49,"Pan, SZ",Nov 20 2022 ,Streaming potential induced from solid-liquid coupling at the micro-nano scale,COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS,"When liquid flows through a pore in a solid, a streaming potential occurs along the pore. When a solid is compressed, its deformation will cause the liquid in the internal pores to flow, resulting in a streaming potential. In this study, we have developed a model composed of a solid thick-walled cylinder and a liquid in its inner hole at the micro-nano scale. When the solid is subjected to uniform pressure the liquid flow velocity distribution in the through hole or tube can be obtained by solid-liquid coupling. A streaming potential equation induced from solid-liquid coupling is established. The solution results of the equation show that the streaming potential is proportional to the derivative of the pressure with respect to time and proportional to the square of the length of the tube. The solution can be degenerated to classical streaming potential relationships by disregarding the influence of solid deformation on the streaming, which demonstrates the validity of the solution.Show less"
