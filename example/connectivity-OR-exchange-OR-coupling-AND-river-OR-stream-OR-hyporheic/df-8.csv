A metagenomic analysis consists of eukaryotic microbial and fungi microbial communities. For this purpose, the samples of hyporheic water were collected from the four piezometers (IYHW1, IYHW2, IYHW3, and IYHW4) that were installed at 10 m interval across the stream. As a control group, the stream water (IYSW1) and the groundwater (IYAW1) were sampled on December 2, 2016. We also measured field parameters and analyzed chemical compositions of the hyporheic waters, stream water, and groundwater. The structure of prokaryote microbial community for high rates of Proteobacteria showed a high rate (90.5 similar to 96.8%) for all samples except IYSW1 and IYHW1. Also, Chytridiomycota in the structure of eukaryotic microbial community was predominant in IYSW1 (57.8%) and IYHW1 (43.4%) but was rarely (<0.2%) found in IYAW1 and IYHW4. As a result, it is inferred that IYSW1 and IYHW1 were dominated by stream water, and IYAW1 and IYHW4 were found to be dominated by groundwater. And IYHW2 and IYHW3 were a point zone of interaction between groundwater and stream water, where microbial and hydrological changes were dynamic.Show less"
1,"Roy, ML",Oct 2017 ,Modelling functional fish habitat connectivity in rivers: A case study for prioritizing restoration actions targeting brown trout,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,"1. Throughout the world, decreased connectivity of fluvial habitats caused by artificial river channel alterations such as culverts, weirs and dykes is seen as an important threat to the long-term survival of many aquatic species. In addition to assessing habitat quality and abundance, wildlife managers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of taking into account habitat connectivity when setting priorities for restoration. In this paper, a new approach of spatial analysis adapted to rivers and streams is proposed for modelling 2D functional habitat connectivity, integrating distance, costs and risk of travelling between habitat patches (e.g. daily use, spawning, refuge) for particular fish species, size classes and life stages.2. This approach was applied to a case study in which brown trout (Salmo trutta) habitat accessibility was examined and compared under various scenarios of stream restoration in a highly fragmented stream in Ile-de-France. Probabilities of reaching spawning habitats were estimated from a trout-populated area located downstream of the barriers and from potential daily-use habitat patches across the stream segment.3. The approach successfully helped prioritize restoration actions by identifying options that yield the greatest increase in accessible spawning habitat areas and connectivity between spawning habitat and daily-use habitat patches. This case study illustrates the practical use of the approach and the software in the context of river habitat management.Show less"
2,"Wroblicky, GJ",Mar 1998 ,Seasonal variation in surface-subsurface water exchange and lateral hyporheic area of two stream-aquifer systems,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We used two-dimensional unconfined transient groundwater flow models to investigate the interface between stream and groundwater flow systems, or hyporheic zone, of two first-order streams that drain catchments with distinctly different alluvial sediments and bedrock lithology. Particle tracking showed that lateral hyporheic area (planimetric area of flow paths lateral to the stream that are recharged by and return to the stream with travel times of 10 days or less) differed between the two study streams and varied with discharge within each system. At the Rio Calaveras (welded tuff), lateral hyporheic area ranged from 1.7 to 4 m(2) over the annual cycle. In the Aspen Creek system (sandstone), lateral hyporheic area (1-1.5 m(2)) was restricted to roughly half of that observed at Rio Calaveras. The size of the hyporheic zone lateral to the streams at both sites decreased by approximately 50% during high flows. Sensitivity analyses indicated that changes in the hydraulic conductivity of alluvial and streambed sediments and variation in recharge rates have greatest impact on the magnitude, direction, and spatial distribution of stream-groundwater exchange.Show less"
3,"Han, BS",Mar 30 2013 ,Spatial and temporal intensification of lateral hyporheic flux in narrowing intra-meander zones,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Meander bends in alluvial rivers morphologically evolve towards meander cut-off with narrowing intra-meander necks, and this should steepen hydraulic gradients and intensify intra-meander hyporheic flux. This research used dye tracking and head loss measurements in a 1:500 planimetrically scaled laboratory river table to quantify the spatial and temporal intensification of intra-meander flux rates at two evolution ages. The younger meander bend, M1, had a sinuosity of 2.3, a river neck width of 0.39cm, and 0.6% river slope, and the older meander bend, M3, had a sinuosity of 5.2, a river neck width of 0.12cm, and 0.5% river slope. Flux into and out of the meander bend was estimated along the normalized curvilinear distance s*, with the meander neck at s*=0.1 and s*=0.9, the meander centroid at s*=0.37 and s*=0.63, and the apex at s*=0.5. Between the meander centroid and neck, we documented a 60% spatial intensification for M1 and a 90% spatial intensification for M3. Between M1 and M3, we documented a 135% temporal intensification at the neck and a 100% intensification at the centroid. Our empirical spatial and temporal intensification rates involving the M1 and the M3 scenario were one to three times lower than theoretical rates derived from a river evolution model with equivalent M1 and M3 planimetry. Overestimation by the theoretical model was attributed to exaggerated head loss caused by the model neglecting groundwater contributions to river stage. Hyporheic exchange provides critical ecosystem services, and its spatial and temporal variation with meander evolution should be considered in river management.

4,"Shrivastava, S",Dec 2021 ,Sediment Reworking in Streambeds With Fine Sediment Deposits and Its Influence on Hyporheic Flow Regime,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The mobilization and mixing of sediments by the activities of in-stream fauna, referred to as sediment reworking, constantly modifies the hydro-physical properties of streambeds. This sediment-organism interaction has been increasingly recognized to influence the hyporheic exchange flows in stream ecosystems, particularly in low flow environments (e.g., during base flow). In this work, we advance the knowledge of sediment reworking process by studying its impact on hyporheic exchange flows in streambeds with fine sediment deposits. Laboratory experiments are conducted in re-circulating flumes following a control (only fine sediments) and treatment- (fine sediments + organisms) based design. The experiments involve studying the interaction of model organisms (Lumbriculus variegatus) with fine sediment (clay) deposits, and its subsequent influence on hyporheic flow regime in homogenous streambeds with fine sand, coarse sand, and gravel as substrate sediments. We observe that model organisms burrowed extensively into the fine sediment layer, mixed the clay particles with underlying grains, and eventually exposed the substrate sediments in the treatment flumes. Consequently, the treatment flumes exhibited greater solute penetration depth, shorter residence times, and higher hyporheic exchange flux compared to their respective control flumes. The results also suggest that the modification of hyporheic exchange flows depends on the overall reworking of the beds that is, the interaction of organisms with both substrate material and deposited fine sediments. It is critical to comprehend the influence of streambed inhabitants on mass and energy exchange across the sediment-water interface as it has implications on the overall quality of both stream and groundwater.Show less"
5,"Kondolf, GM",Dec 2006 ,Process-based ecological river restoration: Visualizing three-dimensional connectivity and dynamic vectors to recover lost linkages,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,"Human impacts to aquatic ecosystems often involve changes in hydrologic connectivity and flow regime. Drawing upon examples in the literature and from our experience, we developed conceptual models and used simple bivariate plots to visualize human impacts and restoration efforts in terms of connectivity and flow dynamics. Human-induced changes in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity are often accompanied by changes in flow dynamics, but in our experience restoration efforts to date have more often restored connectivity than flow dynamics. Restoration actions have included removing dams to restore fish passage, reconnecting flow through artificially cut-off side channels, setting back or breaching levees, and removing fine sediment deposits that block vertical exchange with the bed, thereby partially restoring hydrologic connectivity, i.e., longitudinal, lateral, or vertical. Restorations have less commonly affected flow dynamics, presumably because of the social and economic importance of water diversions or flood control. Thus, as illustrated in these bivariate plots, the trajectories of ecological restoration are rarely parallel with degradation trajectories because restoration is politically and economically easier along some axes more than others.Show less"
6,"Trevisan, D",Mar 2016 ,Coupling catchment hydrology and transient storage to model the fate of solutes during low-flow conditions of an upland river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The residence time of solutes in catchments is longer during low-flow conditions, due to the lengthening of transport routes and the decrease in transfer velocities. In rivers, transient storage depends largely on exchanges with channel storage and the hyporheic zone and reflects the capacity of the river to buffer pollutant loads before they enter the aquatic environment of final receptors. Our objective was to evaluate the fate of solutes along a typical confined river of upland catchments. First, we calculate lateral inflows using a variable-source hydrology approach. Then, water motion and quality in the river channel are predicted by combining hydrodynamics and exchanges with channel storage and the hyporheic zone. The model is mainly parametrized from literature data during baseflow conditions to mimic the fate of adsorptive and non-persistent pollutants. Residence time in surface water, channel storage and the hyporheic zone were found to be sensitive to lateral inflows from groundwater seepage. Channel storage is the main process controlling residence time in upstream conditions, where the riverbed is mainly composed of stones and bedrock. Downstream, along with the formation of sediment deposits and riffle-pool units, hyporheic exchanges also control the lag time in the transfer of solutes. By integrating physically based processes, the number of parameters is small, but the model still requires a detailed description of stream geometry and morphology. It can be used to evaluate stream restoration or catchment-river management when detailed data of stream geometry and morphology are available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
7,"Bellucci, CJ",Oct 2020 ,A novel method to evaluate stream connectivity using trail cameras,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Stream connectivity is important for the ecological health of the stream and downstream waters. In this study, we use the term stream connectivity to mean hydrologically connected pools and riffles that link stream habitat along a longitudinal continuum (upstream to downstream), while also recognizing the lateral dimension (connection to flood plain) and vertical connection to groundwater. There are thousands of man-made structures (i.e. dams, culverts, surface and groundwater withdrawal locations) in Connecticut which negatively impact stream connectivity and can result in aquatic habitat fragmentation. Cost-effective techniques are needed to assess human alteration to streams in order to prioritize management actions to restore stream connectivity. We developed a method to characterize stream connectivity using commercially available trail cameras that cost less than approximately $500 per deployment. We developed a six-category system to describe the variations in stream connectivity observed using the trail camera images. We then used the categorical data to calculate metrics that quantify stream connectivity. To pilot this approach, we evaluated reference locations with minimal anthropogenic influence on stream connectivity in comparison with stream reaches likely to be impacted by nearby groundwater wells. We found that metrics derived from trail camera images were useful to quantify stream connectivity. We anticipate that the methods outlined herein is a useful stream connectivity assessment tool that can be effectively communicated to scientists and non-scientists.

8,"Arntzen, EV",Oct 2006 ,"Effects of fluctuating river flow on groundwater/surface water mixing in the hyporheic zone of a regulated, large cobble bed river",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Physicochemical relationships in the boundary zone between groundwater and surface water (i.e. the hyporheic zone) are controlled by surface water hydrology and the hydrogeologic properties of the riverbed. We studied how sediment permeability and river discharge altered the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and water quality of the hyporheic zone within the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River. The Columbia River at Hanford is a large, cobble-bed river where water level fluctuates up to 2m daily because of hydropower generation. Concomitant with river stage recordings, continuous readings were made of water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen and water level of the hyporheic zone. The water level data were used to calculate VHG between the river and hyporheic zone. Sediment permeability was estimated using slug tests conducted in piezometers installed into the river bed. The response of water quality measurements and VHG to surface water fluctuations varied widely among study sites, ranging from no apparent response to covariance with river discharge. At some sites, a hysteretic relationship between river discharge and VHG was indicated by a time lag in the response of VHG to changes in river stage. The magnitude, rate of change and hysteresis of the VHG response varied the most at the least permeable location (hydraulic conductivity (K) = 2.9 x 10(-4) cms(-1)) and the least at the most permeable location (K = 8.8 x 10(-3) cms(-1)). Our study provides empirical evidence that sediment properties and river discharge both control the water quality of the hyporheic zone. Regulated rivers, like the Columbia River at Hanford, that undergo large, frequent discharge fluctuations represent an ideal environment in which to study hydrogeologic processes over relatively short time periods (i.e. days to weeks) that would require much longer periods (i.e. months to years) to evaluate in unregulated systems.

9,"Singh, T",Mar 2022 ,Impacts of Peak-Flow Events on Hyporheic Denitrification Potential,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Subsurface flows, particularly hyporheic exchange fluxes, driven by streambed topography, permeability, channel gradient and dynamic flow conditions provide prominent ecological services such as nitrate removal from streams and aquifers. Stream flow dynamics cause strongly nonlinear and often episodic contributions of nutrient concentrations in river-aquifer systems. Using a fully coupled transient flow and reactive transport model, we investigated the denitrification potential of hyporheic zones during peak-flow events. The effects of streambed permeability, channel gradient and bedform amplitude on the spatio-temporal distribution of nitrate and dissolved organic carbon in streambeds and the associated denitrification potential were explored. Distinct peak-flow events with different intensity, duration and hydrograph shape were selected to represent a wide range of peak-flow scenarios. Our results indicated that the specific hydrodynamic characteristics of individual flow events largely determine the average positive or negative nitrate removal capacity of hyporheic zones, however the magnitude of this capacity is controlled by geomorphological settings (i.e., channel slope, streambed permeability and bedform amplitude). Specifically, events with longer duration and higher intensity were shown to promote higher nitrate removal efficiency with higher magnitude of removal efficiency in the scenarios with higher slope and permeability values. These results are essential for better assessment of the subsurface nitrate removal capacity under the influence of flow dynamics and particularly peak-flow events in order to provide tailored solutions for effective restoration of interconnected river-aquifer systems.Show less"
10,"Bottacin-Busolin, A",Jun 2011 ,Evidence of distinct contaminant transport patterns in rivers using tracer tests and a multiple domain retention model,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Solute transport in rivers is controlled by surface hydrodynamics and by mass exchanges with distinct retention zones. Surface and hyporheic retention processes can be accounted for separately in solute transport models with multiple storage compartments. In the simplest two component model, short term storage can be associated to in-channel transient retention, e.g. produced by riparian vegetation or surface dead zones, and the long-term storage can be associated to hyporheic exchange. The STIR (Solute Transport In Rivers) multiple domain transport model is applied here to tracer test data from three very different Mediterranean streams with distinctive characteristics in terms of flow discharge, vegetation and substrate material. The model is used with an exponential residence time distribution (RTD) to represent surface storage processes and two distinct modeling closures are tested to simulate hyporheic retention: a second exponential RTD and a power-law distribution approximating a known solution for bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. Each stream shows distinct retention patterns characterized by different timescales of the storage time distribution. Both modeling closures lead to very good approximations of the observed breakthrough curves in the two rivers with permeable bed exposed to the flow, where hyporheic flows are expected to occur. In the one case where the occurrence of hyporheic flows is inhibited by bottom vegetation, only the two exponential RTD model is acceptable and the time scales of the two components are of the same magnitude. The significant finding of this work is the recognition of a strong signature of the river properties on tracer data and the evidence of the ability of multiple-component models to describe individual stream responses. This evidence may open a new perspective in river contamination studies, where rivers could possibly be classified based on their ability to trap and release pollutants. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

11,"Stonedahl, SH",Dec 15 2010 ,A multiscale model for integrating hyporheic exchange from ripples to meanders,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"It is necessary to improve our understanding of the exchange of dissolved constituents between surface and subsurface waters in river systems in order to better evaluate the fate of water-borne contaminants and nutrients and their effects on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Here we present a model that can predict hyporheic exchange at the bed-form-to-reach scale using readily measurable system characteristics. The objective of this effort was to compare subsurface flow induced at scales ranging from very small scale bed forms up to much larger planform geomorphic features such as meanders. In order to compare exchange consistently over this range of scales, we employed a spectral scaling approach as the basis for a generalized analysis of topography-induced stream-subsurface exchange. The spectral model involves a first-order approximation for local flow-boundary interactions but is fully three-dimensional and includes the lateral hyporheic zone in addition to the flow directly beneath the streambed. The primary model input parameters are stream velocity and slope, sediment permeability and porosity, and detailed measurements of the stream channel topography. The primary outputs are the distribution of water flux across the stream channel boundary, the resulting pore water flow paths, and the subsurface residence time distribution. We tested the bed-form-exchange component of the model using a highly detailed two-dimensional data set for exchange with ripples and dunes and then applied the model to a three-dimensional meandering stream in a laboratory flume. Having spatially explicit information allowed us to evaluate the contributions of both gravitational and current-driven hyporheic flow through various classes of stream channel features including ripples, dunes, bars, and meanders. The model simulations indicate that all scales of topography between ripples and meanders have a significant effect on pore water flow fields and residence time distributions. Furthermore, complex interactions across the spectrum of topographic features play an important role in controlling the net interfacial flux and spatial distribution of hyporheic exchange. For example, shallow exchange induced by current-driven interactions with small bed forms dominates the interfacial flux, but local pore water flows are modified significantly by larger-scale surface-groundwater interactions. As a result, simplified representations of the stream topography do not adequately characterize patterns and rates of hyporheic exchange.Show less"
12,"Harman, CJ",Sep 2016 ,How does reach-scale stream-hyporheic transport vary with discharge? Insights from rSAS analysis of sequential tracer injections in a headwater mountain stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The models of stream reach hyporheic exchange that are typically used to interpret tracer data assume steady-flow conditions and impose further assumptions about transport processes on the interpretation of the data. Here we show how rank Storage Selection (rSAS) functions can be used to extract process-agnostic information from tracer breakthrough curves about the time-varying turnover of reach storage. A sequence of seven slug injections was introduced to a small stream at base flow over the course of a diel fluctuation in stream discharge, providing breakthrough curves at discharges ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 L/s. Shifted gamma distributions, each with three parameters varying stepwise in time, were used to model the rSAS function and calibrated to reproduce each breakthrough curve with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies in excess of 0.99. Variations in the fitted parameters over time suggested that storage within the reach does not uniformly increase its turnover rate when discharge increases. Rather, changes in transit time are driven by both changes in the average rate of turnover (external variability) and changes in the relative rate that younger and older water contribute to discharge (internal variability). Specifically, at higher discharge, the turnover rate increased for the youngest part of the storage (corresponding to approximately 5 times the volume of the channel), while discharge from the older part of the storage remained steady, or declined slightly. The method is shown to be extensible as a new approach to modeling reach-scale solute transport that accounts for the time-varying, discharge-dependent turnover of reach storage.Show less"
13,"Simcic, T",Jul 2007 ,Intensity of mineralization in the hyporheic zone of the prealpine river Baca (West Slovenia),HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity and oxygen consumption in the interstitial water, and in the fine (i.e. silt) and coarse (sand) sediment fractions from the hyporheic zone of the prealpine river Baca (W Slovenia) have been measured in order to estimate the intensity of potential and actual carbon mineralization through microbial communities. Hyporheic samples from the river bed (RB) and gravel bars (GB) were compared. ETS activity and oxygen consumption of all fractions from the RB did not differ significantly from those from the GB. ETS activity and oxygen consumption of biofilm attached to 1 g of the silt were higher than of that attached to the same mass of the sand. A significant correlation between ETS activity and oxygen consumption indicated that the former should be a good indicator of intensity of bioactivity in hyporheic sediments. The ratio of ETS activity to oxygen consumption (ETS/R ratio) revealed that the oxygen consumption of microorganisms is responsible for approximately 60% of the metabolic potential in the hyporheic sediments. The contributions of different fractions of sediment to the total ETS activity differed between RB and GB. The contribution of microorganisms in the interstitial water and silt was higher in GB than in the RB, but the sand fraction contributed less to potential carbon loss in GB than in the RB. Average total respiratory carbon loss per volume through the hyporheic zone was higher in the RB than in GB. The main reasons suggested are the different intensity of exchange of surface water with the hyporheic zone, and the rate of consolidation of sediments, which is primarily a function of river hydrology and geomorphology.Show less"
14,"Shen, GC",Apr 2022 ,Quantifying the Effects of Bed Roughness on Transit Time Distributions via Direct Numerical Simulations of Turbulent Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We report direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of hyporheic exchange for a flat river bed with two different particle roughness textures, at a surface flow friction Reynolds number of 395 and a bed permeability Reynolds number of 2.6. Transit time distributions (TTDs), subsurface flow patterns, and the interfacial volumetric fluxes are discussed. The transit time was quantified using a forward particle tracking method based on pure advection by three-dimensional, pore-resolved, time-mean velocities. Results show that bed roughness induces deep subsurface flow paths that yield a TTD with a power-law tail. Roughness obstructs the surface flow, creating interfacial pressure variations which induce subsurface flow. Next, the molecular diffusion is accounted for based on a random walk method and is shown to increase transit times regardless of roughness texture. This work demonstrates that particle roughness on a macroscopically flat sediment bed can induce significant hyporheic exchange that is fundamentally similar to that induced by bedforms.Show less"
15,"Roley, SS",Jul 10 2012 ,Hydrologic connectivity increases denitrification in the hyporheic zone and restored floodplains of an agricultural stream,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Stream ecotones, specifically the lateral floodplain and subsurface hyporheic zone, can be important sites for nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification, but their role in streams with constructed floodplains has not been examined. We studied denitrification in the hyporheic zone and floodplains of an agriculturally influenced headwater stream in Indiana, USA, that had floodplains added as part of a ""two-stage ditch"" restoration project. To examine the potential for N removal in the hyporheic zone, we seasonally measured denitrification rates and nitrate concentrations by depth into the stream sediments. We found that nitrate concentration and denitrification rates declined with depth into the hyporheic zone, but denitrification was still measureable to a depth of at least 20 cm. We also measured denitrification rates on the restored floodplains over the course of a flood (pre, during, and post-inundation), and also compared denitrification rates between vegetated and non-vegetated areas of the floodplain. We found that floodplain denitrification rates increased over the course of a floodplain inundation event, and that the presence of surface water increased denitrification rates when vegetation was present. Stream ecotones in midwestern, agriculturally influenced streams have substantial potential for N removal via denitrification, particularly when they are hydrologically connected with high-nitrate surface water.Show less"

17,"Malcolm, IA",Apr 2010 ,Hyporheic zone processes in a canalised agricultural stream: implications for salmonid embryo survival,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Agricultural practices have the potential to influence hyporheic exchange through increased fine sediment loads and through reduced hydraulic conductivity, bed roughness and morphological diversity. These impacts can reduce connectivity between stream and hyporheic waters to the detriment of salmonid embryos. Salmonids bury their eggs in streambed gravels, typically to depths of up to 300 mm and for incubation periods of up to 6 months. Embryo survival is dependant on a complex range of factors which critically includes the delivery of oxygen from surface waters. This paper investigates hyporheic zone exchange processes, oxygen concentration and embryo survival in a canalised agricultural stream at a range of nested spatiotemporal scales. Results are contrasted with those from the Girnock Burn, a relatively undisturbed catchment. Conservative tracer experiments were used to assess reach average hyporheic exchange using the USGS OTIS model. Artificial redds were used to assess reach scale variability in hyporheic processes. Incubation stacks were used to assess embryo mortality and hyporheic water quality with depth at the scale of individual redds. Optodes (optical dissolved oxygen sensors) were used at a sub-set of sites to assess fine scale temporal variability in hyporheic oxygen and temperature. Stream and hyporheic hydrochemistry were used to infer source water contributions and provenance. Data showed that reach average hyporheic exchange in the Newmills Burn was ca. five times less than in the Girnock Burn. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations related strongly to spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater (GW) discharge. Embryo survival was significantly correlated with DO. It is suggested that low DO in the Newmills Burn relates to groundwater upwelling and limited hyporheic exchange caused by a combination of low morphological diversity, hydraulic conductivity and bed roughness. It is suggested that future studies of embryo survival should look beyond the single issue of fine sediment effects to include a broader understanding of hyporheic zone processes.Show less"
18,"Ward, AS",Apr 23 2020 ,"Climate Change Causes River Network Contraction and Disconnection in the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA",FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Headwater streams account for more than 89% of global river networks and provide numerous ecosystem services that benefit downstream ecosystems and human water uses. It has been established that changes in climate have shifted the timing and magnitude of observed precipitation, which, at specific gages, have been directly linked to long-term reductions in large river discharge. However, climate impacts on ungaged headwater streams, where ecosystem function is tightly coupled to flow permanence along the river corridor, remain unknown due to the lack of data sets and ability to model and predict flow permanence. We analyzed a network of 10 gages with 38-69 years of records across a 5th-order river basin in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, finding increasing frequency of lower low-flow conditions across the basin. Next, we simulated river network expansion and contraction for a 65-year period of record, revealing 24% and 9% declines in flowing and contiguous network length, respectively, during the driest months of the year. This study is the first to mechanistically simulate network expansion and contraction at the scale of a large river basin, informing if and how climate change is altering connectivity along river networks. While the heuristic model presented here yields basin-specific conclusions, this approach is generalizable and transferable to the study of other large river basins. Finally, we interpret our model results in the context of regulations based on flow permanence, demonstrating the complications of static regulatory definitions in the face of non-stationary climate.Show less"
19,"Munz, M",Aug 2016 ,Analysis of riverbed temperatures to determine the geometry of subsurface water flow around in-stream geomorphological structures,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The analytical evaluation of diurnal temperature variation in riverbed sediments provides detailed information on exchange fluxes between rivers and groundwater. The underlying assumption of the stationary, one-dimensional vertical flow field is frequently violated in natural systems where subsurface water flow often has a significant horizontal component. In this paper, we present a new methodology for identifying the geometry of the subsurface flow field using vertical temperature profiles. The statistical analyses are based on model optimisation and selection and are used to evaluate the shape of vertical amplitude ratio profiles. The method was applied to multiple profiles measured around in-stream geomorphological structures in a losing reach of a gravel bed river. The predominant subsurface flow field was systematically categorised in purely vertical and horizontal (hyporheic, parafluvial) components. The results highlight that river groundwater exchange flux at the head, crest and tail of geomorphological structures significantly deviated from the one-dimensional vertical flow, due to a significant horizontal component. The geometry of the subsurface water flow depended on the position around the geomorphological structures and on the river level. The methodology presented in this paper features great potential for characterising the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of complex subsurface flow geometries by using measured temperature time series in vertical profiles.

To measure the effectiveness of restoration and to understand the drivers of these functional responses, we monitored five restored urban streams that represent a range of channel morphology and restoration ages. High and low elevation floodplain plots were established in triplicate in each stream to capture variation in floodplain connectivity. We measured ecosystem geomorphic and soil attributes, sediment and nutrient loading, and rates of soil nutrient biogeochemistry processes (denitrification; N and P mineralization) then used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify controls on sedimentation and nutrient processing. Local channel and floodplain morphology and position within the river network controlled connectivity with increased sedimentation at sites downstream of impaired reaches and at floodplain plots near the stream channel and at low elevations. We observed that nitrogen loading (both dissolved and particulate) was positively correlated with denitrification and N mineralization and dissolved phosphate loading positively influenced P mineralization; however, none of these input rates or transformations differed between floodplain elevation categories. Instead, continuous gradients of connectivity were observed rather than categorical shifts between inset and high floodplains. Organic matter and nutrient content in floodplain soils increased with the time since restoration, which highlights the importance of recovery time after construction that is needed for restored systems to increase ecosystem functions. Our results highlight the importance of restoring floodplains downstream of sources of impairment and building them at lower elevations so they flood frequently, not just during bankfull events. This integrated approach has the greatest potential for increasing trapping of sediment, nutrients, and associated pollutants in restored streams and thereby improving water quality in urban watersheds.Show less"
22,"Negishi, JN",Sep 1 2019 ,Coupled benthic-hyporheic responses of macroinvertebrates to surface water pollution in a gravel-bed river,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Interactions between the hyporheic and benthic zones play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of river ecosystems, but simultaneous assessments of hyporheic and benthic macroinvertebrate responses to surface water pollution are limited. We examined how hyporheic (50 cm below surface) and benthic (surface) invertebrates responded to water pollution that originated from a point source (wastewater treatment plant) in a gravel-bed river in Hokkaido, Japan. Dissolved nutrient levels and algal biomass were significantly higher at sample sites down- than upstream of the point source. Furthermore, nitrate concentrations increased gradually from up- to downstream sites, which suggest the presence of diffuse pollution sources in the surrounding areas. Closely synchronized fluctuations of water temperature and similar water quality in the surface and hyporheic zones indicated that the hyporheic zone was highly hydrologically interactive with the surface water. Chloroperlidae (mostly Alloperla ishikariana) had a disproportionately high abundance in the hyporheic zone relative to the benthic zone, regardless of the surface water quality. Numerically dominant invertebrate taxa increased in abundance below the point source of pollution in both the benthic and hyporheic habitats. High N stable isotope ratios (SIR) of the invertebrates in both habitat types indicated that invertebrates assimilated anthropogenic N via the ingestion of pollution-contaminated food resources. End-member mixing analyses based on C SIR demonstrated that assimilation of anthropogenic N occurred because of the increase in available food resources originating from the biofilm. The trophic structure of invertebrates changed less markedly in the hyporheic zone than in the benthic zone, suggesting that the hyporheic assemblage was less sensitive than the benthic assemblage to the changes in surface water quality. Overall, our findings showed that the numeric responses of the invertebrate assemblage to anthropogenic changes in surface water quality were similar and coupled between the benthic and hyporheic zones.Show less"
23,"Casas-Mulet, R",Mar 15 2015 ,The effects of hydropeaking on hyporheic interactions based on field experiments,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hydropeaking power production has the potential to pose serious challenges towards hydrology, water quality and ecology in the downstream water bodies. The effects of such abrupt changes of flow in hyporheic exchange have been explored in a few cases in the literature. This paper extends previous works with a study of finer time resolution in a river of a smaller size and with different climatic characteristics, adding to the current knowledge of peaking-hyporheic interactions. A high-frequency logging field experiment measuring hyporheic flow and temperature was conducted on a similar to 30x20m gravel bar frequently exposed to dry conditions because of fast and abrupt flow changes. This study demonstrates that hyporheic processes are sensitive to hydropeaking with respect to rates of change, durations and temperature. Differences BETWEEN individual events, seasons, watering and dewatering processes and positions in the river bed that can be potentially relevant to ecology were investigated. Understanding the complexity of those processes at the fine scale from the physical point of view is both important for the judgement of potential ecological impacts and for the future management of such regulated systems.

24,"Hester, ET",Oct 2016 ,Vertical surface water-groundwater exchange processes within a headwater floodplain induced by experimental floods,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Restoring hydrologic connectivity between channels and floodplains is common practice in stream and river restoration. Floodplain hydrology and hydrogeology impact stream hydraulics, ecology, biogeochemical processing, and pollutant removal, yet rigorous field evaluations of surface water-groundwater exchange within floodplains during overbank floods are rare. We conducted five sets of experimental floods to mimic floodplain reconnection by pumping stream water onto an existing floodplain swale. Floods were conducted throughout the year to capture seasonal variation and each involved two replicate floods on successive days to test the effect of varying antecedent moisture. Water levels and specific conductance were measured in surface water, soil, and groundwater within the floodplain, along with surface flow into and out of the floodplain. Vegetation density varied seasonally and controlled the volume of surface water storage on the floodplain. By contrast, antecedent moisture conditions controlled storage of water in floodplain soils, with drier antecedent moisture conditions leading to increased subsurface storage and slower flood wave propagation across the floodplain surface. The site experienced spatial heterogeneity in vertical connectivity between surface water and groundwater across the floodplain surface, where propagation of hydrostatic pressure, preferential flow, and bulk Darcy flow were all mechanisms that may have occurred during the five floods. Vertical connectivity also increased with time, suggesting higher frequency of floodplain inundation may increase surface water-groundwater exchange across the floodplain surface. Understanding the variability of floodplain impacts on water quality noted in the literature likely requires better accounting for seasonal variations in floodplain vegetation and antecedent moisture as well as heterogeneous exchange flow mechanisms.

25,"Wu, LW",Apr 9 2021 ,How daily groundwater table drawdown affects the diel rhythm of hyporheic exchange,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Groundwater table dynamics extensively modify the volume of the hyporheic zone and the rate of hyporheic exchange processes. Understanding the effects of daily groundwater table fluctuations on the tightly coupled flow and heat transport within hyporheic zones is crucial for water resources management. With this aim in mind, a physically based model is used to explore hyporheic responses to varying groundwater table fluctuation scenarios. The effects of different timing and amplitude of groundwater table daily drawdowns under gaining and losing conditions are explored in hyporheic zones influenced by natural flood events and diel river temperature fluctuations. We find that both diel river temperature fluctuations and daily groundwater table drawdowns play important roles in determining the spatiotemporal variability of hyporheic exchange rates, temperature of exfiltrating hyporheic fluxes, mean residence times, and hyporheic denitrification potentials. Groundwater table dynamics present substantially distinct impacts on hyporheic exchange under gaining or losing conditions. The timing of groundwater table drawdown has a direct influence on hyporheic exchange rates and hyporheic buffering capacity on thermal disturbances. Consequently, the selection of aquifer pumping regimes has significant impacts on the dispersal of pollutants in the aquifer and thermal heterogeneity in the sediment.Show less"
26,"PALMER, MA",Feb 1992 ,RESPONSE OF INVERTEBRATES TO LOTIC DISTURBANCE - A TEST OF THE HYPORHEIC REFUGE HYPOTHESIS,OECOLOGIA,"Recovery following hydrological disturbances is usually rapid for lotic invertebrates. Stream ecologists have assumed that recovery is facilitated by behavioral migrations during floods down into the hyporheic zone (the interstitial spaces of a streambed) to seek temporary refuge from possible erosion (the ""hyporheic refuge hypothesis""). We provide the first explicit test of this hypothesis by evaluating three predictions of the hypothesis. We coupled field observations of the response of meiofaunal invertebrates to floods with field and flume experiments. The study site was a sandy-bottom stream in northern Virginia. Prediction 1, that loss of fauna from a streambed during floods should be minimal as long as the depth of scour in the streambed is less than the depth of the hyporheic zone, was not supported for any taxon. For two floods which varied considerably in magnitude, 50-90% of the fauna was lost from the bed despite the fact that the depth of scour (10-30 cm) was significantly less than the total depth of the hyporheic zone (50 cm). Prediction 2, that fauna should move deeper into the bed at higher flows, was supported by field observations during only one of two floods and then only for rotifers. In flume experiments that tested for finer scale behavioral movements, significant vertical migrations were found for copepods and chironomids which moved 1.5-3.5 cm downward as mean velocity (3 cm off bottom) was increased from 5-23 cm/s. Movements down by rotifers were not found in the flume experiments. Prediction 3, that the hyporheic zone is the most important source of colonists to defaunated areas, was supported in part by field experiments. The hyporheic route was not the primary route for any taxon but it was as important for the rotifers and copepods as water column or streambed surface routes. We conclude that, even though small-scale (cm's) migrations into the streambed in response to increased flow may be observed for some taxa and the hyporheic zone may serve as a partial source of colonists following disturbances, movements down are not adequate in preventing significant losses of meiofauna during floods.Show less"
27,"Musial, CT",Feb 28 2016 ,Surface water-groundwater exchange dynamics in a tidal freshwater zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In coastal rivers, tides can propagate for tens to hundreds of kilometres inland beyond the saltwater line. Yet the influence of tides on river-aquifer connectivity and solute transport in tidal freshwater zones (TFZs) is largely unknown. We estimate that along the TFZ of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA), 11% of river water exchanges through tidal bank storage zones. Additional hyporheic processes such as flow through bedforms likely contribute even more exchange. The turnover length associated with tidal bank storage is 150km, on the order of turnover lengths for all hyporheic exchange processes in non-tidal rivers of similar size. Based on measurements at a transect of piezometers located 17km from the coast, tides exchange 0.36m(3) of water across the banks and 0.86m(3) across the bed per unit river length. Exchange fluxes range from -1.66 to 2.26mday(-1) across the bank and -0.84 to 1.88mday(-1) across the bed. During rising tide, river water infiltrates into the riparian aquifer, and the downstream transport rate in the channel is low. During falling tide, stored groundwater is released to the river, and the downstream transport rate in the channel increases. Tidal bank storage zones may remove nutrients or other contaminants from river water and attenuate nutrient loads to coasts. Alternating expansion and contraction of aerobic zones in the riparian aquifer likely influence contaminant removal along flow paths. A clear need exists to understand contaminant removal and other ecosystem services in TFZs and adopt best management practices to promote these ecosystem services.

28,"McCallum, JL",Mar 2020 ,A Numerical Stream Transport Modeling Approach Including Multiple Conceptualizations of Hyporheic Exchange and Spatial Variability to Assess Contaminant Removal,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Understanding the mechanisms and controls on contaminant removal in streams is essential in managing human and ecosystem health. The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays a key role in the removal of contaminants from streams. Often, tracer tests are implemented in conjunction with measurements of compounds to assess the removal rates of contaminants in streams. The predicted removal rates largely rely on the estimated hyporheic residence time, and hence, the chosen conceptual model of hyporheic exchange flows (HEFs) will influence the predicted removal rate. Despite this, different HEF models are generally not considered when assessing contaminant removal rates. In this paper, we present a numerical modeling approach for interpreting tracer tests to determine contaminant removal rates that allows for multiple conceptual models of HEF to be considered. We demonstrate this method by interpreting data from a conservative tracer test in conjunction with grab samples of trace organic compounds using two commonly used models of HEF: one that assumes first-order exchange between the stream and the HZ and one that considers a power law weighting of first-order exchange coefficients. For the three degrading compounds measured, guanylurea, valsartan, and diclofenac, we observed that the power law model consistently predicted higher removal rates in the stream compared to the first-order model. Variations were also observed between the removal rates estimated in the HZ. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple conceptualizations of the HEF when assessing contaminant removal rates.Show less"
29,"Schmadel, NM",May 16 2016 ,Hyporheic exchange controlled by dynamic hydrologic boundary conditions,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"The relative roles of dynamic hydrologic forcing and geomorphology as controls on the timescales and magnitudes of stream-aquifer exchange and hyporheic flow paths are unknown but required for management of stream corridors. We developed a comprehensive framework relating diel hydrologic fluctuations to hyporheic exchange in the absence of geomorphic complexity. We simulated groundwater flow through an aquifer bounded by a straight stream and hillslope and under time-varying boundary conditions. We found that diel fluctuations can produce hyporheic flow path lengths and residence times that span orders of magnitude. With these results, hyporheic flow path residence times and lengths can be predicted from the timing and magnitude of diel fluctuations and valley slope. Finally, we demonstrated that dynamic hydrologic boundary conditions can produce spatial and temporal scales of hyporheic flow paths equivalent to those driven by many well-studied geomorphic features, indicating that these controls must be considered together in future efforts of upscaling to stream networks.Show less"
30,"Jin, GQ",Dec 2020 ,Transport of zinc ions in the hyporheic zone: Experiments and simulations,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Large amounts of toxic metals are discharged into rivers and lakes, but little is known about the factors that drive the adsorption and transformation of these metals in the hyporheic zone and the exchange flux across the sediment-water interface. To better understand transport and transformation of metal ions in the hyporheic zone, flume experiments and numerical simulations were performed in a streambed with periodic bedforms using zinc ions. Compared to non-adsorbing contaminant, the results show that adsorption leads to a more rapid decrease in the concentration of Zn2+ in the overlying water, and a lower final concentration is reached. The mass of adsorbed ions is several times higher than that of free ions in the bedform's water phase. Indeed, metal adsorption is in the shallow layer of the streambed. Although this prevents heavy metal groundwater contamination, the same cannot be said of shallow layer of the hyporheic zone. Knowledge of the migration and transformation of metal ions in the hyporheic zone provides insights pertinent to the restoration of polluted rivers.Show less"
31,"Ward, AS",May 2015 ,Coupled reversion and stream-hyporheic exchange processes increase environmental persistence of trenbolone metabolites,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Existing regulatory frameworks for aquatic pollutants in the United States are idealized, often lacking mechanisms to account for contaminants characterized by (1) bioactivity of both the parent and transformation products and (2) reversible transformations (that is, metastable products) driven by chemical or physical heterogeneities. Here, we modelled a newly discovered product-to-parent reversion pathway for trenbolone acetate (TBA) metabolites. We show increased exposure to the primary metabolite, 17 alpha-trenbolone (17 alpha-TBOH), and elevated concentrations of the still-bioactive primary photoproduct hydroxylated 17 alpha-TBOH, produced via phototransformation and then converted back to 17 alpha-trenbolone in perpetually dark hyporheic zones that exchange continuously with surface water photic zones. The increased persistence equates to a greater potential hazard from parent-product joint bioactivity at locations and times when reversion is a dominant trenbolone fate pathway. Our study highlights uncertainties and vulnerabilities with current paradigms in risk characterization.Show less"
32,"Liao, ZJ",Jul 7 2011 ,"Shape-free inference of hyporheic traveltime distributions from synthetic conservative and ""smart'' tracer tests in streams",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone has been identified as important for river ecology, natural biogeochemical turnover, filtration of particles, degradation of dissolved pollutants-and thus for the self-cleaning capacity of streams, and for groundwater quality. Good estimation of the traveltime distribution in the hyporheic zone is required to achieve a better understanding of transport in the river system. The transient-storage model has been accepted as an appropriate tool for reach-scale transport in rivers undergoing hyporheic exchange, but the choice of the best parametric function for the hyporheic traveltime distribution has remained unclear. We present an approach to obtaining hyporheic traveltime distributions from synchronous conservative and ""smart'' tracer experiments that does not rely on a particular functional form of the hyporheic traveltime distribution, but treats the latter as a continuous function. Nonnegativity of the hyporheic traveltime distribution is enforced by the application of Lagrange multipliers. A smoothness parameter, needed for regularization, and uncertainty bounds are obtained by the expectation-maximization method relying on conditional realizations. The shape-free inference provides the opportunity for capturing unconventional shapes, e. g., multiple peaks, in the estimation. We test the approach by applying it to a virtual test case with a bimodal hyporheic traveltime distribution, which is recaptured in the inversion of noisy data.Show less"

Field and laboratory experiments show that advective exchange through the underlying sediments is an important mechanism of solutes transport and storage in riverine systems. Here, Transient Storage Model parameters are obtained for reactive solute exchange driven by bedform-induced advection. Consideration of exchange induced by this single mechanism allows specific relationships between model parameters and system properties like solute reactivity to be identified. This work shows that when a simplified model like the Transient Storage Model is applied to analyze metal storage in river sediments, particular attention must be devoted to the choice of modeling parameters.

34,"Moore, RD",Aug 30 2005 ,"Thermal regime of a headwater stream within a clear-cut, coastal British Columbia, Canada",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This study examined the thermal regime of a headwater stream within a clear-cut. The stream had a complex morphology dominated by step-pool features, many formed by sediment accumulation upstream of woody debris. Maximum daily temperatures increased up to 5 degrees C after logging, and were positively associated with maximum daily air temperature and negatively with discharge. Maximum daily temperatures generally increased with downstream distance through the cut block, but decreased with distance in two segments over distances of tens of metres, where the topography indicated relatively concentrated lateral inflow. Localized cool areas within a step-pool unit were associated with zones of concentrated upwelling. Bed temperatures tended to be higher and have greater ranges in areas of downwelling flow into the bed. Heat budget estimates were made using meteorological measurements over the water surface and a model of net radiation using canopy characteristics derived from fisheye photography. Heat exchange driven by hyporheic flow through the channel step was a cooling effect during daytime, with a magnitude up to approximately 25% that of net radiation during the period of maximum daytime warming. Heat budget calculations in these headwater streams are complicated by the heterogeneity of incident solar radiation and channel geometry, as well as uncertainty in estimating heat and water exchanges between the stream and the subsurface via hyporheic exchange and heat conduction.

35,"Ward, AS",Mar 2018 ,Time-Variable Transit Time Distributions in the Hyporheic Zone of a Headwater Mountain Stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Exchange of water between streams and their hyporheic zones is known to be dynamic in response to hydrologic forcing, variable in space, and to exist in a framework with nested flow cells. The expected result of heterogeneous geomorphic setting, hydrologic forcing, and between-feature interaction is hyporheic transit times that are highly variable in both space and time. Transit time distributions (TTDs) are important as they reflect the potential for hyporheic processes to impact biogeochemical transformations and ecosystems. In this study we simulate time-variable transit time distributions based on dynamic vertical exchange in a headwater mountain stream with observed, heterogeneous step-pool morphology. Our simulations include hyporheic exchange over a 600 m river corridor reach driven by continuously observed, time-variable hydrologic conditions for more than 1 year. We found that spatial variability at an instance in time is typically larger than temporal variation for the reach. Furthermore, we found reach-scale TTDs were marginally variable under all but the most extreme hydrologic conditions, indicating that TTDs are highly transferable in time. Finally, we found that aggregation of annual variation in space and time into a master TTD reasonably represents most of the hydrologic dynamics simulated, suggesting that this aggregation approach may provide a relevant basis for scaling from features or short reaches to entire networks.Show less"
36,"Tonina, D",Jan 31 2007 ,Hyporheic exchange in gravel bed rivers with pool-riffle morphology: Laboratory experiments and three-dimensional modeling,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[ 1] We report the first laboratory simulations of hyporheic exchange in gravel pool-riffle channels, which are characterized by coarse sediment, steep slopes, and three-dimensional bed forms that strongly influence surface flow. These channels are particularly important habitat for salmonids, many of which are currently at risk worldwide and which incubate their offspring within the hyporheic zone. Here we perform a set of laboratory experiments examining the effects of discharge and bed form amplitude on hyporheic exchange, with surface-subsurface mixing measured directly from the concentration decay of a conservative tracer ( fluorescein) injected into the surface flow. Near-bed pressure measurements were also used to predict hyporheic exchange from a three-dimensional pumping transport model. Comparison of the predicted and observed hyporheic exchange shows good agreement, indicating that the major mechanism for exchange is bed form - induced advection. However, the effect of bed forms is modulated by discharge and the degree of topographic submergence. We also tested the performance of the hydrostatic pressure as a proxy for the observed near-bed pressure in driving hyporheic exchange, which would facilitate field measurement and analysis of hyporheic flow in natural rivers. We found agreement with measured hyporheic exchange only for low bed form amplitudes and high flows.Show less"
37,"Harvey, BN",Jan 2011 ,Net dissolved inorganic nitrogen production in hyporheic mesocosms with contrasting sediment size distributions,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The interstitial spaces within streambeds are recognized as an important location of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) transformations in streams. However, it remains uncertain how physical characteristics of streambeds affect the magnitude and net outcome of subsurface nitrogen transformations. We tested whether the size distribution of streambed sediments, in isolation from the influence of streambed topography and groundwater upwelling, could affect net DIN uptake or production along interstitial flow paths. Mesocosms constructed from PVC pipe (15 cm diameter x 1 m long) were filled with either coarse gravel/cobble or gravel/cobble mixed with finer sediments (5 mesocosms per sediment treatment). Mesocosms were submerged in a stream and oriented, so that surface water flowed through the sediments. After 2 months incubation, we measured DIN in interstitial water at 20 cm intervals and dissolved oxygen at 10 cm intervals along mesocosm flow paths. In both sediment types, DIN concentrations increased longitudinally along mesocosm flow paths in the direction of interstitial flow, indicating net DIN production. Although DIN increased to higher concentrations in mesocosms with fine sediments, greater exchange flow through coarse sediments resulted in similar rates of net DIN production and delivery to surface water. Production of DIN in both sediment types was concentrated within the first 10 cm of interstitial flow paths, with no significant production further along the flow paths. Coarse sediments had higher rates of oxygen consumption per unit sediment volume than the coarse-fine sediment mix, suggesting interstitial water velocity may be an important factor affecting hyporheic microbial metabolism.Show less"
38,"Marciniak, M",Aug 2022 ,Parametric study of fluidization conditions of bed sediments in the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The phenomenon of fluidization of the bed sediment of the hyporheic zone involves the production of dynamic suspension of solid particles in a stream of water flowing in the direction opposite to gravity. Fluidization may be permanent; then, it becomes a spring or a headwater zone, where groundwater discharge rate is almost unchanged within an entire hydrological year. But it can also occur periodically, depending on the changing hydrodynamic conditions. In such cases, the fluidization of the bed sediment of the hyporheic zone may disturb its functioning by changing the conditions of surface water and groundwater exchange. The disturbances affect hydrodynamic and hydrochemical processes connected with water exchange, but first of all, the living conditions of hyporheic zone flora and fauna. Therefore, the phenomenon of fluidization is significant for broadly understood ecology of the hyporheic zone. The paper presents the analysis of conditions of fluidization occurrence depending on the main hydrodynamic parameters that may affect this process. The authors analysed the influence of the difference in water level between the drained aquifer and the river, the hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy of the aquifer, the vertical hydraulic conductivity in the hyporheic zone, thickness of the hyporheic zone, and the width of the river on the possibility of fluidization of the bed sediment of the hyporheic zone. The range of variability of particular parameters corresponds to the actual variability of those parameters in natural conditions. It was proved that the fluidization of the bed sediment of the hyporheic zone mostly depends on: water level difference, hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, and value of vertical hydraulic conductivity in the hyporheic zone. The other parameters have little influence on this process.Show less"
39,"Li, B",Feb 2020 ,Flexible and Modular Simultaneous Modeling of Flow and Reactive Transport in Rivers and Hyporheic Zones,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Investigations of coupled multiphysics processes in rivers and hyporheic zones have extensively used numerical models. Most existing models use a sequential, one-way coupling between the surface and subsurface domains. Such one-way coupling potentially introduces error. To overcome this, a fully coupled model, hyporheicFoam, was developed using the open-source computational platform OpenFOAM. It captures the coupled flow and multicomponent reactive transport processes within both surface and subsurface domains and across their interface. The coupling between two domains is implemented by mapping conservative flux boundary conditions at the interface through an iterative algorithm. Reactive transport is enabled by specifying a reaction network. To start, we have implemented reaction kinetics following the double Monod-type model with inhibition. The model capability is illustrated through modeling of both conservative and reactive hyporheic flow and transport through dune bedforms. With the novel coupled model, it is now possible to quantify reactions wherein the reactants and products are constantly exchanging between domains and have feedbacks. hyporheicFoam can simulate large, three-dimensional cases owing to the computational flexibility and power offered by the code structure and parallel design of OpenFOAM.Show less"
40,"Robertson, AL",Apr 2021 ,Invertebrate Responses to Restoration across Benthic and Hyporheic Stream Compartments,WATER,"River restoration is a multi-billion-dollar business, yet it is unclear whether benthic community health, which is routinely monitored, can be used as a proxy for the health of the hyporheos. Applying a Before-After-Control-Impact approach to a UK case study, we compared the effects of removing an impoundment on the hyporheos with effects on the benthos. We compared invertebrate biological traits that we expected to respond to the restoration. We constructed sample-size based diversity curves and determined beta-diversity between compartments and reaches. Two years post-restoration, hyporheic taxon richness was significantly lower in the restored reach compared to the control. However, three years post-restoration taxon richness was significantly higher in the impact reach. The composition of the control and impact reach hyporheos was most dissimilar at the first sampling time point post-restoration and at this time there was a universal decrease in the relative abundance of burrowing organisms respiring through gills. We did not detect a signal of restoration on benthic assemblage diversity and composition, perhaps because reach-scale restorations can be overwhelmed by catchment-scale disturbances. Thus, the hyporheos and the benthos responded differently to restoration. Given the importance of the hyporheic zone in the provision of ecosystem function and services, it is clear that it should be included in future monitoring protocols that aim to assess river restoration success.Show less"
41,"Kasahara, T",Apr 1 2008 ,Modeling the effects of lowland stream restoration projects on stream-subsurface water exchange,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"The relative effect of individual elements of restoration projects on stream-subsurface water exchange was studied by identifying elements that were most effective in increasing downwelling stream water (DSW) into subsurface environments using groundwater flow modeling. Several restoration projects studied in lowland streams involved riffle-pool construction, lateral gravel bar construction and channel re-meandering. Simulations using a homogeneous field of mean hydraulic conductivity that removed heterogeneity showed a large decline in DSW in the four restoration projects studied, suggesting that use of coarse sediments in construction initially increases stream-subsurface water exchange, but the effects may not persist in streams where fine sediments clog streambeds. In two riffle-pool construction projects studied, modification of the channel gradient showed a greater effect on DSW than the alteration of substrate texture. In the gravel bar construction site, modeling results indicated that the construction of a riffle-pool sequence along the bar had a greater effect than the construction of the gravel bar itself. In contrast in the channel re-meandering site, the combination of a greater sinuosity and a lower hydraulic head along the small riffles resulted in re-meandering having a greater effect than the associated riffle-pool construction. A simulation in which the floodplain sediments of low saturated hydraulic conductivity at the re-meandered site were replaced with sandy gravels increased DSW by 10 times. This modeling suggests that the addition of coarse sediments in combination with re-meandering would be required to significantly enhance stream-subsurface water exchange in reaches with fine-grained floodplain sediments. Designing the size and type of morphologic features constructed in restoration projects is somewhat flexible, and the use of modeling to simulate stream-groundwater interactions may help to enhance the hydrologic link with a stream and the subsurface environment in restored stream reaches.

When these structures change hydraulic gradients they may affect ecological stream functions, such as hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) patterns. A study of constructed in-channel structure controls on HEF was conducted in the third-order Batavia Kill, New York using stream and hyporheic temperature amplitude analysis and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) hydraulic simulations. Temperature monitors were installed in the water column and channel bed at six locations around each of seven in-channel restoration structures (three cross-vanes and four J-hooks) at baseflow in 2007. Elevation surveys of the structures were then used to simulate HEF using CFD. The results indicate a pattern of pronounced upwelling in the run section just below the structure, upwelling transitioning to downwelling within the pool, and pronounced downwelling in the glide out of the pool. This pattern is consistent with natural riffle pool sequences. The direction of HEF inferred from the temperature amplitude analysis agreed with the direction of flow simulated with CFD at 80% of the locations, and the few disagreements were expected due to model limitations. CFD simulation demonstrated that increasing stream flows result in changes in HEF spatial patterns and magnitude at each structure. This work illustrates how CFD simulations can guide design of in-channel restoration structures for HEF function. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
44,"Jones, KL",Jun 30 2008 ,"Geomorphology, hydrology, and aquatic vegetation drive seasonal hyporheic flow patterns across a gravel-dominated floodplain",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Across 1.7 km(2) of the Umatilla River floodplain (Oregon, USA), we investigated the influences of an ephemeral tributary and perennial 'spring channel' (fed only by upwelling groundwater) on hyporheic hydrology. We derived maps of winter and summer water-table elevations from data collected at 46 monitoring wells and 19 stage gauges and used resulting maps to infer groundwater flow direction. Groundwater flow direction varied seasonally across the floodplain and was influenced by main channel stage, flooding, the tributary creek, and the location and direction of hyporheic exchange in the spring channel. Hyporheic exchange in the spring channel was evaluated with a geochemical mixing model, which confirmed patterns of floodplain groundwater movement inferred from water-table maps and showed that the spring channel was fed predominantly by hyporheic water from the floodplain aquifer (87% during winter, 80% during summer), with its remaining flow supplied by upslope groundwater from the adjacent catchment aquifer. Summertime growth of aquatic macrophytes in the spring channel also influenced patterns of hyporheic exchange and groundwater flow, direction in the alluvial aquifer by increasing flow resistance in the spring channel, locally raising surface water stage and adjacent water-table elevation, and thereby altering the slope of the water-table in the hyporheic zone. The Umatilla River floodplain is larger than most sites where hyporheic hydrology has been investigated in detail. Yet, our results corroborate other research that has identified off-channel geomorphic features as important drivers of hyporheic hydrology, including previously published modeling efforts from a similar river and field observations from smaller streams.

45,"Ward, AS",Aug 16 2011 ,How can subsurface modifications to hydraulic conductivity be designed as stream restoration structures? Analysis of Vaux's conceptual models to enhance hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Despite the growing interest in hyporheic exchange and the associated stream ecosystem processes, few studies consider restoration of hyporheic exchange as a design goal. Here we study the design of three types of subsurface structures for hyporheic restoration after conceptual designs published over 40 years ago. Vaux's designs involve modifying the subsurface with low or high hydraulic conductivity material placed at the streambed or adjacent to a confining layer below the stream. In this preliminary analysis of subsurface structure design we use two-dimensional groundwater flow modeling of structures to simulate structure performance in plane bed streams for ranges of structure geometric design and hydraulic conductivities. Structure performance is evaluated on the basis of total streambed flux, physical extent of hyporheic flow paths created, and residence time distributions along flow paths modified by the structures. High hydraulic conductivity structures bend flow paths toward and through the structures themselves; performance is controlled by the structure hydraulic conductivity. Results show low hydraulic conductivity structure performance is insensitive to the structure material; hyporheic exchange is created by deflecting flow paths away from the structure itself. Time scales of simulated exchange are great enough to promote nitrification, denitrification, respiration, and thermal buffering in the subsurface, though these processes will also be controlled by site-specific chemical and biological factors. General design recommendations for specific restoration objectives are presented. Results of this study can be extrapolated to further understand the interaction of natural subsurface heterogeneities (e. g., clay and gravel deposits and bedrock knickpoints) and flow fields in creating hyporheic flow paths.Show less"
46,"Heffernan, JB",Oct 2008 ,Consequences of a biogeomorphic regime shift for the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran Desert stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Feedbacks between vegetation and geomorphic processes can generate alternative stable states and other nonlinear behaviours in ecological systems, but the consequences of these biogeomorphic interactions for other ecosystem processes are poorly understood. In this study, we describe the changes in the hydrological, geomorphic and biogeochemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran desert stream (Sycamore Creek, Arizona, U.S.A.) in response to a transition from an unvegetated gravel-bed state to densely vegetated wetlands (cienegas).2. A survey of the entire length of Sycamore Creek indicated that cienegas occupied c. 18% of the stream, and were disproportionately represented in constrained canyons rather than wide, unconstrained valleys.3. Vegetated patches were characterized by low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate and high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in the hyporheic zone. In contrast to unvegetated areas, hyporheic DO in cienegas exhibited no relationship with vertical hydraulic gradients.4. Increases in hyporheic DO following removal of vegetation by floods supports the hypothesis that these reduced conditions were the result of biogeochemical and geomorphic changes associated with vegetation establishment. In locations where vegetation persisted, hyporheic DO exhibited no response to flooding; in sections where vegetation was removed hyporheic DO closely tracked post-flood increases in surface stream DO.5.Shallow sediments in vegetated patches were finer and more organic-rich than in unvegetated patches, due to increased deposition during floods. Conservative tracer additions indicated that hydrological exchange between the surface stream and hyporheic zone was much lower in cienegas than in gravel-bed reaches.6. Vegetation establishment in desert streams not only alters the physical and chemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone, but also the nature of interactions between surface and hyporheic subsystems.Show less"
47,"Angermann, L",Oct 11 2012 ,Application of heat pulse injections for investigating shallow hyporheic flow in a lowland river,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic zone processes can have significant impact on groundwater and surface water resources. Detailed knowledge of exchange flow patterns is crucial for understanding the ecohydrological and biogeochemical functioning of river corridors. In particular, small-scale hyporheic exchange flow is still poorly understood, partially because of the lack of adequate in situ monitoring technology. This paper investigates the spatial heterogeneity of hyporheic exchange flow in a lowland river at multiple scales. It demonstrates the conjunctive use of active heat pulse tracing at shallow depths (15 cm) and vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) at 120-150 cm streambed depth for improving the understanding of hyporheic exchange flow processes. Generally positive VHG indicated a regional dominance of groundwater up-welling. High and temporally variable VHG were used to identify confined conditions caused by low conductivity layers in the subsurface (low connectivity), while locations with lower and temporally less variable VHG indicated free groundwater up-welling (high connectivity) in highly conductive sediments. A heat pulse sensor (HPS) was applied for identifying shallow hyporheic flow at three locations representative for high versus low streambed connectivity. Shallow hyporheic flow patterns were found to be spatially heterogeneous. Subsurface flow could only partially be explained by streambed topography. Surface water infiltration and horizontal flow coincided with inhibited groundwater upwelling, whereas locations with high streambed connectivity were characterized by increased up-welling. The combined information of spatiotemporal VHG variability and flow vector frequency distribution by HPS has the potential to improve the understanding of impacts of streambed topography and subsurface stratification on hyporheic flow patterns.Show less"
48,"Leibowitz, SG",Apr 2018 ,Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to Downstream Waters: An Integrated Systems Framework,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Interest in connectivity has increased in the aquatic sciences, partly because of its relevance to the Clean Water Act. This paper has two objectives: (1) provide a framework to understand hydrological, chemical, and biological connectivity, focusing on how headwater streams and wetlands connect to and contribute to rivers; and (2) briefly review methods to quantify hydrological and chemical connectivity. Streams and wetlands affect river structure and function by altering material and biological fluxes to the river; this depends on two factors: (1) functions within streams and wetlands that affect material fluxes; and (2) connectivity (or isolation) from streams and wetlands to rivers that allows (or prevents) material transport between systems. Connectivity can be described in terms of frequency, magnitude, duration, timing, and rate of change. It results from physical characteristics of a system, e.g., climate, soils, geology, topography, and the spatial distribution of aquatic components. Biological connectivity is also affected by traits and behavior of the biota. Connectivity can be altered by human impacts, often in complex ways. Because of variability in these factors, connectivity is not constant but varies over time and space. Connectivity can be quantified with field-based methods, modeling, and remote sensing. Further studies using these methods are needed to classify and quantify connectivity of aquatic ecosystems and to understand how impacts affect connectivity.Show less"
49,"Drummond, JD",Apr 2018 ,"Less Fine Particle Retention in a Restored Versus Unrestored Urban Stream: Balance Between Hyporheic Exchange, Resuspension, and Immobilization",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Stream restoration goals include reducing erosion and increasing hyporheic exchange to promote biogeochemical processing and improve water quality. Little is known, however, about fine particle dynamics in response to stream restoration. Fine particles (<100 mu m) are exchanged with transient storage areas near and within streambeds and banks. Fine particle retention directly impacts carbon and nutrient cycling by supporting benthic and hyporheic primary production, but overaccumulation of fine particle deposits can impair metabolism by burying benthic biofilms and reducing streambed permeability. We analyzed the transport and retention of water and fine particles at both the reach and local scales in a restored urban stream, 9years postrestoration. We injected conservative solute and fine particle tracers under summer baseflow conditions and monitored their distribution between surface water, porewaters, and storage areas (i.e., biofilms, hyporheic zones, and slow surface waters). Comparison of the results to a nearby unrestored stream demonstrate that the restored reach had 10-45 times greater exchange of fine particles with transient storage zones, but 5 times lower rate of net particle immobilization. Local-scale results showed that restoration increased fine particle exchange with short-term storage areas but did not increase long-term particle retention. Thus, the restored stream rapidly exchanged fine sediments with transient storage areas, but did not store fine sediments as efficiently as the unrestored stream. The decreased retention of particulate organic matter in the restored stream may reduce biogeochemical processes, such as denitrification, by not providing sufficient organic carbon or the surface area required for microbial colonization.Show less"
