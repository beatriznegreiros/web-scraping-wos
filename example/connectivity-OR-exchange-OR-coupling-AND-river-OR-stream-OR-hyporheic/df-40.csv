0,"Cheng, Y",Jul 2018 ,China's hybrid global city region pathway: Evidence from the Yangtze River Delta,CITIES,"As the number of global cities grows and the extent of their city region hinterlands expands it is increasingly important to understand connectivity of cities within global city regions to the core city as well as connectivity of both the core city and the entire city region to other cities in the world city network. By investigating multi scalar network connectivity of Shanghai both to cities in its hinterland and the world city network from 2000 to 2013, this article concludes that Shanghai's status as a global city is based both on connections to cities within the region and connections of Shanghai municipality to other cities in the world city network. Based on measures of connectivity such as connectedness of advanced producer service firms, airport arrivals and departures, and container TEUs, since 2000 Shanghai has become one of the most connected cities in the world. However, Shanghai's global connectivity is not the same as its importance in the world economy. The market value of firms listed on the Shanghai stock exchange, foreign exchange turnover, and international transshipments from the Port of Shanghai are modest compared to other leading global cities. City network analysis within the Shanghai mega-city region provides a novel explanation for this apparent paradox. Shanghai's global connectivity is strongly influenced by its close connection with its hinterland, the Yangtze River Delta, and elsewhere in China. Shanghai's rapidly growing global connectivity is largely a result of the emergence of the Yangtze River Delta as a global city region. Shanghai, as the core city in the city region, is both a hub connecting flows of goods, capital, people, and information within the Yangtze River Delta region and a gateway through which other cities in the city region connect to the world city network. Scholars worldwide can apply the methods used in this article to illuminate the hybrid global city pathway.Show less"
1,"Xie, ZQ",Jun 2015 ,"Improving the forecast precision of river stage spatial and temporal distribution using drain pipeline knowledge coupled with BP artificial neural networks: a case study of Panlong River, Kunming, China",NATURAL HAZARDS,"Artificial neural network technologies are frequently used in flood disaster simulations to aid regional disaster analyses. However, despite being an important factor that affects urban waterlogging, urban underground pipeline knowledge is seldom coupled with artificial neural networks or applied to urban waterlogging simulations. This article presents a simulation of urban waterlogging that utilises professional knowledge of urban underground drain pipelines coupled with BP artificial neural networks. Using this method, actual input weights are computed to simulate the river stage variations in the Panlong River of Kunming, China, for 35 consecutive hours during a heavy rainstorm that took place on 19 July 2013. The artificial neural network is coupled with drain pipeline knowledge, and river stage variations during this heavy rainfall are successfully simulated. The study results indicate that, in comparison with traditional BP neural network simulation methods, the use of knowledge of urban drain pipelines coupled with artificial neural networks yields more precise forecasting results for the urban river stage, with 85.7 % of all simulated river stage values corresponding closely with observed values. To support decision-making based on urban waterlogging forecasts, a map showing the impact distribution of the maximum river stage of Panlong River on the day of field study is provided. The results of the simulations show that the predicted locations of river water overflow were similar to the observed locations.Show less"
2,"Shen, YC",Feb 2020 ,Coupling relationship between green production and green consumption: Case of the Yangtze River Delta area,NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING,"Green production and green consumption have always been topics of concern. This study explores the coupling relationship between green production and green consumption by setting up a coupling coordination degree model using 2006-2015 panel data for the Yangtze River Delta area. The results highlight that, first, the contribution rate of the tertiary industry to the gross domestic product index is the key factor influencing green production. Meanwhile, passenger volume in the public traffic index is the main factor impacting green consumption. Second, while both green production and consumption levels have somewhat improved in the area, the gap between them continues to widen. Furthermore, the improvement in green consumption lags behind that in green production. Finally, the coupling coordination degree between green production and consumption in the area shows an increasing trend, although at a low level. These findings suggest that governments should focus on improving green consumption to increase the coupling coordination degree.Show less"

From the results obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), it was concluded that the sediments of Drini i Bardhe River are weathering products of sandstones; the sediments of Morava e Binces, Sitnica and of the upper course of Lepenc are weathering products of magmatic rocks and sandstones; the sediments of the lower stretch of Lepenc are weathering products of magmatic rocks, sandstones and carbonates. The concentration of major and minor elements was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), the amounts of P and S by inductively coupled plasma in combination with optical emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES), and the amounts of Hg by cold vapor in combination with adsorption atomic spectroscopy (CV-AAS). Assessment of sediment contamination with toxic elements was performed by comparison with the existing criteria for sediment quality. Results obtained by the box plot method showed the regions with determined anomalous element concentration values in stream sediments of Kosovo. Two locations in Sitnica River at Fushe Kosova (Kosovo Poije) and Mitrovica are significantly polluted as a result of Zn and Pb ore processing and Zn electrolysis. In the lower course of Morava River, sediments are contaminated with Cd. Increased concentrations of Mn were observed near the source of Drini i Bardhe River, suggesting natural origin. Continuation of sediment monitoring is recommended, particularly on Sitnica and Morava rivers, which flow through Serbia to enter ultimately the Black Sea.Show less"
4,"Westhoff, MC",2011 ,"Quantifying spatial and temporal discharge dynamics of an event in a first order stream, using distributed temperature sensing",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Understanding the spatial distribution of discharge can be important for water quality and quantity modeling. Non-steady flood waves can, particularly as a result of short high intensity summer rainstorms, influence small headwater streams significantly. The aim of this paper is to quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of stream flow in a headwater stream during a summer rainstorm. These dynamics include gains and losses of stream water, the effect of bypasses that become active and hyporheic exchange fluxes that may vary over time as a function of discharge. We use an advection-dispersion model coupled with an energy balance model to simulate in-stream water temperature, which we compare with high resolution temperature observations obtained with Distributed Temperature Sensing. This model was used as a learning tool to stepwise unravel the complex puzzle of in-stream processes subject to varying discharge. Hypotheses were tested and rejected, which led to more insight in the spatial and temporal dynamics in discharge and hyporheic exchange processes. We showed that, for the studied stream infiltration losses increase during a small rain event, while gains of water remained constant over time. We conclude that, eventually, part of the stream water bypassed the main channel during peak discharge. It also seems that hyporheic exchange varies with varying discharge in the first 250m of the stream; while further downstream it remains constant. Because we relied on solar radiation as the main energy input, we were only able to apply this method during a small summer storm and low flow conditions. However, when additional (artificial) energy is available, the presented method is also applicable in largerShow less"
5,"Paillex, A",Jun 2015 ,Testing predictions of changes in alien and native macroinvertebrate communities and their interaction after the restoration of a large river floodplain (French Rhone),FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Large river floodplains contain a high diversity of habitats and species but are highly threatened by human activities. River floodplain restoration is increasingly undertaken to reverse biodiversity loss and enhance ecosystem services. Few studies have examined the consequences on the biota of restoring lateral connectivity, a key variable that represents the exchange of materials and organisms between the river and its floodplain. We developed models to describe the richness and abundance of aquatic macroinvertebrates in 18 channels of the Rhone floodplain and predict how restoration (i.e. the increase in lateral connectivity of floodplain channels) should alter the native and alien communities. Models quantified how richness and abundance decrease for lentic taxa and increase for lotic and alien taxa with higher connectivity between the floodplain channels and the main channel. Predicted changes were weakly related to overall observed changes when all restored channels were combined, but consistent with observed changes when floodplain channels were grouped by restoration type. We highlighted that restoration interventions modifying lateral connectivity induced a change of lentic and lotic taxa richness in accordance with the predictions. Richness of alien taxa was favoured by restoration more than predicted; however, no interaction between alien species changes and native species was detected after restoration. Restoration of the ecosystem predictably transformed native communities and encouraged alien species, at least over the 4years studied. Our findings demonstrate that lateral connectivity is a key variable driving macroinvertebrate communities in large river floodplains and that the response of macroinvertebrates to restoration of a disturbance-driven ecosystem can in part be predicted. Therefore, the outcome of restoration programmes can be optimised by quantifying lateral connectivity before and after restoration.Show less"

7,"Tummers, JS",Nov 1 2016 ,Evaluating the effectiveness of restoring longitudinal connectivity for stream fish communities: towards a more holistic approach,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"A more holistic approach towards testing longitudinal connectivity restoration is needed in order to establish that intended ecological functions of such restoration are achieved. We illustrate the use of a multi-method scheme to evaluate the effectiveness of 'nature-like' connectivity restoration for stream fish communities in the River Deerness, NE England. Electric-fishing, capture-mark-recapture, PIT telemetry and radio-telemetry were used to measure fish community composition, dispersal, fishway efficiency and upstream migration respectively. For measuring passage and dispersal, our rationale was to evaluate a wide size range of strong swimmers (exemplified by brown trout Salmo trutta) and weak swimmers (exemplified by bullhead Cottus perifretum) in situ in the stream ecosystem. Radio-tracking of adult trout during the spawning migration showed that passage efficiency at each of five connectivity-restored sites was 81.3-100%. Unaltered (experimental control) structures on the migration route had a bottle-neck effect on upstream migration, especially during low flows. However, even during low flows, displaced PIT tagged juvenile trout (total n=153) exhibited a passage efficiency of 70.1-93.1% at two nature-like passes. In mark-recapture experiments juvenile brown trout and bullhead tagged (total n=5303) succeeded in dispersing upstream more often at most structures following obstacle modification, but not at the two control sites, based on a Laplace kernel modelling approach of observed dispersal distance and barrier traverses. Medium-termpost-restoration data (2-3 years) showed that the fish assemblage remained similar at five of six connectivity-restored sites and two control sites, but at one connectivity-restored headwater site previously inhabited by trout only, three native non-salmonid species colonized. We conclude that stream habitat reconnection should support free movement of a wide range of species and life stages, wherever retention of such obstacles is not needed to manage non-native invasive species. Evaluation of the effectiveness of fish community restoration in degraded streams benefits from a similarly holistic approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
8,"Gosch, NJC",Nov 2021 ,Floodplain connectivity and age-0 sturgeon prey consumption in the lower Missouri River,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Floodplains are generally considered important nursery habitat for young fish, but little information exists regarding the importance of this habitat for Scaphirhynchus sturgeon. During 2019, the lower Missouri River experienced widespread, prolonged floodplain connectivity, and this study provides the first documentation of age-0 Scaphirhynchus sturgeon floodplain prey consumption. Individuals captured on the floodplain primarily consumed chironomids, but the amount of prey consumed was similar to or lower than individuals captured from nearby mainstem reaches and a side-channel during previous years. Similarly, 2019 floodplain sampling often yielded lower age-0 sturgeon condition when assessing length-weight relationships among years. Further downstream, we also analyzed diets from 2019 in two mainstem reaches below Kansas City for comparison with data from 2014 to 2015. In both reaches, 2019 condition was lower than 2014 and 2015 despite a relatively higher growth rate. The amount of prey consumed in 2019 was also similar to or lower than 2014 and 2015 in Glasgow Reach, whereas 2019 yielded the highest prey consumption in Monarch Reach. Our results suggest that the 2019 high-water event did not yield increased prey consumption or condition for age-0 sturgeon on the floodplain, while the findings for mainstem habitats below Kansas City were inconsistent. Overall, empty stomachs were rare regardless of capture location and floodplain individuals appeared to be growing and surviving despite the observed differences. These results address an important information gap for age-0 sturgeon and future data from additional floodplain sites would provide valuable context regarding the applicability of these findings to other areas.Show less"
9,"Furst, DJ",2014 ,Floodplain connectivity facilitates significant export of zooplankton to the main River Murray channel during a flood event,INLAND WATERS,"This study assessed the role that floods play in providing lateral connectivity between riverine habitats and floodplains, stimulating productivity and contributing zooplankton from the floodplain to the river channel. The study took place on the Chowilla Floodplain of the River Murray, Australia, and the adjacent River Murray Channel throughout the 2010-2011 floods. We found that a considerable transfer of zooplankton from the floodplain into the river channel occurred. Average zooplankton abundance was higher on the floodplain than the main river channel and increased the zooplankton abundance in the river channel downstream. At the peak of the flood, flows reached similar to 93 000 megalitres per day (ML d(-1)), inundating similar to 67 km(2) of floodplain. At the time of this study, up to 6.3 +/- 1.6 (SD) tonnes per day of zooplankton (dryweight) was being exported from the Chowilla floodplain. Differences in species assemblages were also observed within the River Murray, which seemed to be caused by the influence of the Chowilla Floodplain. This study demonstrated that floodplains provide significant zooplankton biomass, which constitutes a resource input into the riverine food web. These results provide some evidence for the Flood Pulse Concept, which highlights the importance of lateral hydrological connectivity between riverine habitats and floodplains in stimulating productivity and providing a linkage between habitats for biota. Management of regulated lowland rivers should consider not only the provision of water to the floodplain, but also the return of the floodplain waters to the river to sustain riverine food webs.Show less"
10,"Mahoney, DT",Oct 20 2020 ,Integrating connectivity theory within watershed modelling part I: Model formulation and investigating the timing of sediment connectivity,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Integrating connectivity theory within watershed modelling is one solution to overcome spatial and temporal shortcomings of sediment transport prediction, and Part I and II of these companion papers advance this overall goal. In Part I of these companion papers, we present the theoretical development of probability of connectivity formula considering connectivity's magnitude, extent, timing and continuity that can be applied to watershed modelling. Model inputs include a high resolution digital elevation model, hydrologic watershed variability, and field connectivity assessments. We use the model to investigate the dependence of the probability of connected timing and spatial connectivity on sediment transport predictors. Results show the spatial patterns of connectivity depend on both structural and functional characteristics of the catchment, such as hillslope gradient, upstream contributing area, soil texture, and stream network configuration (structural) and soil moisture content and runoff generation (functional). Spatial connectivity changes from catchment-to-catchment as a function of soil type and drainage area; and it varies from event-to-event as a function of runoff depth and soil moisture conditions. The most sensitive connected pathways provide the stencil for the probability of connectivity, and pathways connected from smaller hydrologic events are consistently reconnected and built upon during larger hydrologic events. Surprisingly, we find the probability of connected timing only depends on structural characteristics of catchments, which are considered static over the timescales analyzed herein. The timing of connectivity does not statistically depend on functional characteristics, which relaxes the parameterization across events of different magnitudes. This result occurs because the pathway stencil accumulates sediment from adjacent soils as flow intensity increases, but this does not statistically shift the frequency distribution.

11,"Nkandeu, YK",May 2022 ,Image encryption using the logistic map coupled to a self-synchronizing streaming,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,"A large number of image encryption algorithms have been proposed in recent years to solve security challenges associated with multimedia communications. Thanks to its simplicity, the logistic map (LM) was abundantly used in the design of these ciphers. However, a careful analysis of the LM reveals that it exhibits weaknesses such as a periodicity in some sequences of numbers it generates, coupled to the short interval of its control parameters. These drawbacks weaken LM-based ciphers. In this paper, we have designed a robust cryptosystem based on the LM coupled to a self-synchronous stream cipher mode, using an external 256-bit key, and operating in a diffusion and permutation round. In this cipher, the secret key is transformed and used to compute values of initial conditions, control parameter values and some other elements needed for encryption. The technique used made up for the LM shortcomings and yielded a more robust cipher as far as cryptanalysis is concerned. An average NCPR of 99.62 and UACI of 33.53 with a keyspace of 10(144), and an entropy of 7.9994 coupled to an average correlation of 0.003 were obtained during the cryptosystem evaluation. These results are encouraging as they compare favourably with those from papers of good standing in literature.Show less"
12,"Vignieri, SN",Jun 2005 ,Streams over mountains: influence of riparian connectivity on gene flow in the Pacific jumping mouse (Zapus trinotatus),MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,"In species affiliated with heterogeneous habitat, we expect gene flow to be restricted due to constraints placed on individual movement by habitat boundaries. This is likely to impact both individual dispersal and connectivity between populations. In this study, a GIS-based landscape genetics approach was used, in combination with fine-scale spatial autocorrelation analysis and the estimation of recent intersubpopulation migration rates, to infer patterns of dispersal and migration in the riparian-affiliated Pacific jumping mouse (Zapus trinotatus). A total of 228 individuals were sampled from nine subpopulations across a system of three rivers and genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. Significant spatial autocorrelation among individuals revealed a pattern of fine-scale spatial genetic structure indicative of limited dispersal. Geographical distances between pairwise subpopulations were defined following four criteria: (i) Euclidean distance, and three landscape-specific distances, (ii) river distance (distance travelled along the river only), (iii) overland distance (similar to Euclidean, but includes elevation), and (iv) habitat-path distance (a least-cost path distance that models movement along habitat pathways). Pairwise Mantel tests were used to test for a correlation between genetic distance and each of the geographical distances. Significant correlations were found between genetic distance and both the overland and habitat-path distances; however, the correlation with habitat-path distance was stronger. Lastly, estimates of recent migration rates revealed that migration occurs not only within drainages but also across large topographic barriers. These results suggest that patterns of dispersal and migration in Pacific jumping mice are largely determined by habitat connectivity.Show less"
13,"Jones, PE",Jul 2021 ,Selective effects of small barriers on river-resident fish,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Habitat fragmentation is a principal threat to biodiversity and artificial river barriers are a leading cause of the global decline in freshwater biota. Although the impact of barriers on diadromous fish is well established, impacts on river-resident fish communities remain unclear, especially for low-head barriers.We examined the movement of five contrasting freshwater fish (topmouth gudgeon, European minnow, stone loach, bullhead and brown trout) in an experimental cascade mesocosm with seven pools separated by small vertical barriers.Passage rates differed significantly among species and increased with body size and sustained swimming speed (U-sus), ranging from an average of 0.2 passes/hr in topmouth gudgeon to 3.4 passes/hr in brown trout. A random-walk simulation indicated that barriers can result in net downstream movement and shifts in community composition.Passage rates in brown trout were leptokurtic, that is, most individuals were relatively sedentary while a small proportion showed frequent movements. Upstream passage rates of brown trout increased with body length and boldness while fish with lower aerobic scope tended to move downstream. Passage rates showed significant individual repeatability in brown trout, independent of body size, indicating the potential for in-stream barriers to exert selective effects on fish populations.Our results show that barrier effects can be more complex than simply blocking fish passage, and that river-resident fish can be impacted even by very small barriers. We show that fish passage depends on a wide range of morphological, physiological and behavioural drivers, and that barriers can exert selective effects on these traits and cause shifts in community composition.Policy implications. Barrier mitigation measures need to embrace interspecific and intraspecific variation in fish passage to avoid inadvertent artificial selection on fish communities. Given the high abundance of low-head structures in river systems worldwide, a paradigm shift is needed to recognise the subtle impacts of small barriers on freshwater biodiversity. Removal of small barriers or nature-like fishways should allow better passage of the wider fish community compared to widely used salmonid-centric fish passage options.Show less"
14,"Tatschner, S",Aug 2021 ,The Stream Exchange Protocol: A Secure and Lightweight Tool for Decentralized Connection Establishment,SENSORS,"With the growing availability and prevalence of internet-capable devices, the complexity of networks and associated connection management increases. Depending on the use case, different approaches in handling connectivity have emerged over the years, tackling diverse challenges in each distinct area. Exposing centralized web-services facilitates reachability; distributing information in a peer-to-peer fashion offers availability; and segregating virtual private sub-networks promotes confidentiality. A common challenge herein lies in connection establishment, particularly in discovering, and securely connecting to peers. However, unifying different aspects, including the usability, scalability, and security of this process in a single framework, remains a challenge. In this paper, we present the Stream Exchange Protocol (SEP) collection, which provides a set of building blocks for secure, lightweight, and decentralized connection establishment. These building blocks use unique identities that enable both the identification and authentication of single communication partners. By utilizing federated directories as decentralized databases, peers are able to reliably share authentic data, such as current network locations and available endpoints. Overall, this collection of building blocks is universally applicable, easy to use, and protected by state-of-the-art security mechanisms by design. We demonstrate the capabilities and versatility of the SEP collection by providing three tools that utilize our building blocks: a decentralized file sharing application, a point-to-point network tunnel using the SEP trust model, and an application that utilizes our decentralized discovery mechanism for authentic and asynchronous data distribution.Show less"

The method employs a cation-exchange membrane to separate metal cations from their complexes; both total and cationic forms of metals were determined by means of GFAAS. The sensitivity of the method for the measurement of trace metal cations is determined by the detection limits of GFAAS for the metals of interest. Comparable concentrations of metal cations in water from NBS and from the Erhjen river were obtained between the DME-GFAAS and calculated (WATEQ4F) methods, indicating that the developed method is promising for natural fresh waters. The effect of pH on the distribution of metal cation in the NBS river water is significant for Cu and Pb; concentrations of these cations increase with decreasing pH. However, the concentrations of Cd and Zn cations do not vary with pH except that the concentration of the Zn cation decreases significantly as the pH value increases beyond 9. The method was applied to measure the capacity of complexing Cu in Chung-Lu river water, which was estimated to be 2.3-mu-M.Show less"
17,"Malison, RL",Sep 1 2016 ,Do beaver dams reduce habitat connectivity and salmon productivity in expansive river floodplains?,PEERJ,"Beaver have expanded in their native habitats throughout the northern hemisphere in recent decades following reductions in trapping and reintroduction efforts. Beaver have the potential to strongly influence salmon populations in the side channels of large alluvial rivers by building dams that create pond complexes. Pond habitat may improve salmon productivity or the presence of dams may reduce productivity if dams limit habitat connectivity and inhibit fish passage. Our intent in this paper is to contrast the habitat use and production of juvenile salmon on expansive floodplains of two geomorphically similar salmon rivers: the Kol River in Kamchatka, Russia (no beavers) and the Kwethluk River in Alaska (abundant beavers), and thereby provide a case study on how beavers may influence salmonids in large floodplain rivers. We examined important rearing habitats in each floodplain, including springbrooks, beaver ponds, beaver-influenced springbrooks, and shallow shorelines of the river channel. Juvenile coho salmon dominated fish assemblages in all habitats in both rivers but other species were present. Salmon density was similar in all habitat types in the Kol, but in the Kwethluk coho and Chinook densities were 3-12x lower in mid- and late-successional beaver ponds than in springbrook and main channel habitats. In the Kol, coho condition (length: weight ratios) was similar among habitats, but Chinook condition was highest in orthofluvial springbrooks. In the Kwethluk, Chinook condition was similar among habitats, but coho condition was lowest in main channel versus other habitats (0.89 vs. 0.99-1.10). Densities of juvenile salmon were extremely low in beaver ponds located behind numerous dams in the orthofluvial zone of the Kwethluk River floodplain, whereas juvenile salmon were abundant in habitats throughout the entire floodplain in the Kol River. If beavers were not present on the Kwethluk, floodplain habitats would be fully interconnected and theoretically could produce 2x the biomass (between June-August, 1,174 vs. 667 kg) and rear 3x the number of salmon (370,000 vs. 140,000) compared to the existing condition with dams present. The highly productive Kol river produces an order of magnitude more salmon biomass and rears 40x the individuals compared to the Kwethluk. If beavers were introduced to the Kol River, we estimate that off-channel habitats would produce half as much biomass (2,705 vs. 5,404 kg) and 3x fewer individuals (1,482,346 vs. 4,856,956) owing to conversion of inter-connected, productive springbrooks into inaccessible pond complexes. We concluded that beaver dams may limit the total amount of floodplain habitat available for salmon rearing in the Kwethluk river and that the introduction of beavers to the Kol river could be detrimental to salmon populations. The introduction of beavers to other large alluvial rivers like those found in Kamchatka could have negative consequences for salmon production.Show less"
18,"Allen, GH",Jan 28 2015 ,Patterns of river width and surface area revealed by the satellite-derived North American River Width data set,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"As hydraulic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical models evolve toward greater spatial resolution and larger extent, robust morphometric data sets are essential to constrain their results. Here we present the Landsat-derived North American River Width (NARWidth) data set, the first fine-resolution, continental scale river centerline and width database. NARWidth contains measurements of >2.4x10(5)km of rivers wider than 30m at mean annual discharge. We find that conventional digital elevation model-derived width data sets underestimate the abundance of wide rivers. To calculate the total surface area of North American rivers, we extrapolate the strong observed relationship between river width and total surface area at different river widths (r(2)>0.99 for 100-2000m widths) to narrower rivers and streams. We conservatively estimate the total surface area of North American rivers as 1.24-0.15+0.39x10(5)km(2) (1 sigma confidence intervals), values 20-15+38% greater than previous estimates used to evaluate greenhouse gas efflux from rivers to the atmosphere.Show less"
19,"Luo, JC",Dec 2019 ,Large spatiotemporal shifts of CO2 partial pressure and CO2 degassing in a monsoonal headwater stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from rivers are a vital part of the global carbon budget. However, data from subtropical areas, especially in the headwater streams, are scare. Spatiotemporal dynamics and drives of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and water-air CO2 fluxes (FCO2) in a monsoonal headwater stream Jinshui River of the Yangtze were unraveled. Our findings suggested that natural process (i.e., hydrology, CO2 outgassing and lithology) and human activities were recognized as significant players in regulating the variability of riverine pCO(2). The mean pCO(2) was significantly higher in the dry season (1562 +/- 975 mu atm) than the wet season (834 +/- 639 mu atm), seasonal trends of pCO(2) were controlled by in situ biogenic activities and rainfall events. The slight fluctuations of pCO(2) from upstream to downstream along main stem implied the mixed influences of distinct water environments and anthropogenic disturbance. Correlation analysis showed that environmental factors, i.e., temperature, pH, TN and DOC were relevant to pronounced spatial and seasonal variability of pCO(2). We highlighted that high water-air CO2 flux was estimated at 343 +/- 413 mmol/m(2/)d (dry: 542 +/- 477 mmol/m(2/)d vs wet: 192 +/- 278 mmol/m (2/)d) in the monsoonal headwater stream, and the watershed-scale carbon budget demonstrated carbon loss via atmospheric exchange was 1.2 times the riverine dissolved carbon export. Our results would fill a large gap in the headwater stream of the Yangtze, and help to accurately estimate the regional to global CO2 outgassing from rivers to the atmosphere.Show less"
20,"Ylla, I",Dec 2010 ,Organic matter availability during pre- and post-drought periods in a Mediterranean stream,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Mediterranean streams are characterized by water flow changes caused by floods and droughts. When intermittency occurs in river ecosystems, hydrologic connectivity is interrupted and this affects benthic, hyporheic and flowing water compartments. Organic matter use and transport can be particularly affected during the transition from wet to dry and dry to wet conditions. In order to characterize the changes in benthic organic matter quantity and quality throughout a drying and rewetting process, organic matter, and enzyme activities were analyzed in the benthic accumulated material (biofilms growing on rocks and cobbles, leaves, and sand) and in flowing water (dissolved and particulate fractions). The total polysaccharide, amino acid, and lipid content in the benthic organic matter were on average higher in the drying period than in the rewetting period. However, during the drying period, peptide availability decreased, as indicated by decreases in leucine aminopeptidase activity, as well as amino acid content in the water and benthic material, except leaves; while polysaccharides were actively used, as indicated by an increase in beta-glucosidase activity in the benthic substrata and an increase in polysaccharide content of the particulate water fraction and in leaf material. During this process, microbial heterotrophs were constrained to use the organic matter source of the lowest quality (polysaccharides, providing only C), since peptides (providing N and C) were no longer available. During the flow recovery phase, the microbial community rapidly recovered, suggesting the use of refuges and/or adaptation to desiccation during the previous drought period. The scouring during rewetting was responsible for the mobilization of the streambed and loss of benthic material, and the increase in high quality organic matter in transport (at that moment, polysaccharides and amino acids accounted for 30% of the total DOC). The dynamics of progressive and gradual drought effects, as well as the fast recovery after rewetting, might be affected by the interaction of the individual dynamics of each benthic substratum: sand sediments and leaves providing refuge for microorganisms and organic matter storage, while on cobbles, an active bacterial community is developed in the rewetting. Since global climate change may favor a higher intensity and frequency of droughts in streams, understanding the effects of these disturbances on the materials and biota could contribute to reliable resource management. The maintenance of benthic substrata heterogeneity within the stream may be important for stream recovery after droughts.Show less"
21,"Birkel, C",May 2014 ,Integrating parsimonious models of hydrological connectivity and soil biogeochemistry to simulate stream DOC dynamics,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"To improve understanding and prediction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and fluxes in northern peat-dominated catchments, we present the development and application of a parsimonious tracer-aided rainfall-runoff model coupled with a biogeochemistry subroutine able to concurrently simulate streamflow and DOC dynamics. The modeling approach which included quantitative assessment of associated uncertainties was conditioned by geochemical tracers which discriminate dominant water sources. Integration of DOC was predicated on statistical time series models which identified air temperature and streamflow as the key proxies that capture DOC supply and transport processes in two upland catchments in Scotland, UK. Conceptualizing the nonlinear partitioning of quick near-surface and slower groundwater runoff sources in combination with a DOC mass balance resulted in a coupled, low-parameter mechanistic model. Model tests showed mostly sensitive parameters and reasonable simulation results with seasonally controlled DOC supply and event-based DOC transport. Transport is facilitated even for smaller events by overland flow from saturated histosols connected to the stream network. However, during prolonged dry periods, near-surface runoff switches off and stream DOC is dominated by low concentration groundwaters. Furthermore, the model was able to explain subtle differences in DOC dynamics between the two catchments mainly reflecting the distribution of saturated soils and available storage. We conclude that tracers and statistical time series models can successfully guide the development of parsimonious yet structurally consistent water quality models. Parsimonious models provide tools for estimating DOC dynamics and loads with reduced uncertainty and potentially greater transferability.Show less"
22,"Madadi, S",Jan 2016 ,Photodegradation of 4-nitrophenol using an impinging streams photoreactor coupled with a membrane,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING-PROCESS INTENSIFICATION,"In the present work, degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in a novel configuration of an axial radial impinging streams photoreactor coupled with a membrane microfiltration was proposed. The influences of initial 4-NP concentration, catalyst loading, slurry flow rate and pH were investigated as the most important operating parameters. Firstly, the performance of axial radial impinging streams photoreactor was evaluated in a batch recirculation mode and optimum conditions for pertinent parameters were determined. Complete decomposition of a 30 ppm batch solution of 4-NP was obtained within almost 180 min under optimal conditions and the decrease in COD and TOC were 71% and 62%, respectively. The experimental data of 4-NP degradation with an initial concentration in the range of 10-50 ppm accorded well with pseudo-first order model. Finally, the photoreactor was equipped with a membrane and applied in the continuous degradation of 4-NP. A combination of pH 4,2 g/LTiO2 and 2.24 L/min flow rate were determined to be the optimized conditions for degradation of 30 ppm 4-NP in the continuous membrane impinging streams photoreactor. In this reactor, an increased performance capability, a less membrane fouling, a higher permeate flow rate and subsequently a higher efficiency compared to conventional processes can be seen.

23,"Lazzaro, G",Mar 2017 ,A probabilistic approach to quantifying hydrologic thresholds regulating migration of adult Atlantic salmon into spawning streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Atlantic salmon is an economically and ecologically important fish species, whose survival is dependent on successful spawning in headwater rivers. Streamflow dynamics often have a strong control on spawning because fish require sufficiently high discharges to move upriver and enter spawning streams. However, these streamflow effects are modulated by biological factors such as the number and the timing of returning fish in relation to the annual spawning window in the fall/winter. In this paper, we develop and apply a novel probabilistic approach to quantify these interactions using a parsimonious outflux-influx model linking the number of female salmon emigrating (i.e., outflux) and returning (i.e., influx) to a spawning stream in Scotland. The model explicitly accounts for the interannual variability of the hydrologic regime and the hydrological connectivity of spawning streams to main rivers. Model results are evaluated against a detailed long-term (40 years) hydroecological data set that includes annual fluxes of salmon, allowing us to explicitly assess the role of discharge variability. The satisfactory model results show quantitatively that hydrologic variability contributes to the observed dynamics of salmon returns, with a good correlation between the positive (negative) peaks in the immigration data set and the exceedance (nonexceedance) probability of a threshold flow (0.3 m(3)/s). Importantly, model performance deteriorates when the interannual variability of flow regime is disregarded. The analysis suggests that flow thresholds and hydrological connectivity for spawning return represent a quantifiable and predictable feature of salmon rivers, which may be helpful in decision making where flow regimes are altered by water abstractions.Show less"
24,"Jahkel, A",Jul 2022 ,Hydrologic Turnover Matters - Gross Gains and Losses of Six First-Order Streams Across Contrasting Landscapes and Flow Regimes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Gross gains and losses of stream water and the consequent hydrologic turnover may modify the composition of stream water and drive in-stream ecological functioning. We evaluated over 500 breakthrough curves of conservative tracer additions to analyze the channel water balance resulting in gross gains and losses, net exchange, and hydrologic turnover. During the hydrological year 2019, seven tracer experiments had been carried out in six first-order streams along 400 m study reaches. All streams are located in the Holtemme catchment (Central Germany) with three each dominated by forested and agricultural land use. Four of the six streams were characterized by net-losing conditions. The overall median of gross exchange was five times higher than net exchange. On average, subsurface gains replaced 50% of the original stream water over less than one kilometer of stream length. We even observed cases where over 95% of the stream water turned over within 100 m. Gross exchange was relatively higher in forested than in agricultural streams. Patterns of exchange in the forested streams persisted spatially and were temporally independent of streamflow, whereas in the agricultural ones, variable spatial patterns and streamflow dependence occurred. Overall, moderate flow coincided with highest relative gross exchange. Our results support previous findings that in-stream solute concentrations could heavily depend on location and magnitude of gains and losses. Gross exchange embodies a permanent but variable control of downstream solute concentrations interacting with the signal of biogeochemical activity. We highlight the importance to include reach-scale hydrological processes in studies on nutrient spiraling.Show less"
25,"Aliyu, A",2018 ,Interference-Aware Multipath Video Streaming in Vehicular Environments,IEEE ACCESS,"The multipath transmission is one of the suitable transmission methods for high data rate oriented communication such as video streaming Each video packets are split into smaller frames for parallel transmission via different paths. One path may interfere with another path due to these parallel transmissions. The multipath oriented interference is due to the route coupling which is one of the major challenges in vehicular traffic environments. The route coupling increases channel contention resulting in video packet collision. In this context, this paper proposes an Interference-aware Multipath Video Streaming (I-MVS) framework focusing on link and node disjoint optimal paths. Specifically, a multipath vehicular network model is derived. The model is utilized to develop interference-aware video streaming method considering angular driving statistics of vehicles. The quality of video streaming links is measured based on packet error rate considering non-circular transmission range oriented shadowing effects. Algorithms are developed as a complete operational I-MVS framework. The comparative performance evaluation attests the benefit of the proposed framework considering various video streaming related metrics.Show less"

Nearly three years of continuous measurements of meteorological factors, surface water and energy fluxes, soil water content, and groundwater table were carried out over a riparian Tamarix spp. stand in the lower Tarim River basin. Because of scarce precipitation and low air humidity, the diurnal and seasonal variations of most meteorological factors exhibited simple unimodal dynamics. However, the seasonal variation of latent heat exchange (LE) was distinctly related to plant phenology. The sensible heat exchange (H) exhibited reverse course with the LE seasonal course, which suggested seasonal variation of the H was controlled by the LE course. In the daytime, a good linear relationship existed between evapotranspiration (ET) and reference evapotranspiration. The yearly ET over the tamarisk stand was approximately 500 mmyear(-1), and the mean daily ET is about 3.85 mm d(-1) in a vibrant growing season. The groundwater table and the soil water content (SWC) near the groundwater table exhibited obvious seasonal and diurnal variations in the growing seasons but SWC in the shallow soil layer did not, suggesting the groundwater was the water source of the tamarisk. Our analysis indicated that under a hyper-arid climate, the energy and water exchanges over riparian tamarisk stands in the lower Tarim River basin showed certain features: (1) plant transpiration accounted for most of the surface ET, with soil evaporation weak and negligible; (2) the seasonal processes of surface energy and water exchanges were highly related with plant phenology; (3) the diurnal processes of ET resulted from the comprehensive effects of all atmospheric factors; and (4) ET depends on groundwater, rather than precipitation.

However, the geochemical characteristics of urban streams in Wuhan, one of the core cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China, remain largely unstudied. Here, we examined the stable isotopes and geochemistry of urban streams at 73 locations in the central districts in Wuhan during May 2019. Maps of isotopic signatures reflected a non-free-flowing state in part of the urban stream system in Wuhan. A lower DO and a higher EC level were found in urban streams relative to the adjacent Yangtze River. The Na+, K+, and Cl- concentrations in urban streams were > 3.0 times as high as those in the Yangtze River, and there was a slight increasing trend between 1.1 and 1.4 times for other major ions. The mildly elevated Fe concentration (1.3 times) and markedly elevated Mn concentration (> 5.0 times) were observed in urban streams. Spearman's correlation analysis indicated strong positive bivariate correlations among Na+, K+, and Cl- in urban streams, and an urban geochemical principal component was identified by principal component analysis. Plotting Na/(Na + Ca) versus total dissolved solids (TDS) indicated a potential risk of ""urban stream syndrome."" These findings can enhance the knowledge of anthropogenic impacts on current urban stream water quality and provide reference for the restoration and improvement of water ecology functions of the urban stream system in Wuhan.Show less"
30,"Neill, AJ",Mar 2019 ,To what extent does hydrological connectivity control dynamics of faecal indicator organisms in streams? Initial hypothesis testing using a tracer-aided model,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The role of hydrological connectivity in driving the dynamics of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) in streams is poorly characterised. Here, we demonstrate how a tracer-aided hydrological model can be used within a coupled modelling approach to explore the role of connectivity in governing stream faecal coliform (FC) dynamics. To do so, we tested a hypothesis that in northern upland catchments, the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between major landscape units (hillslopes and riparian zone) and the stream exert a dominant control on stream FC loads by facilitating generation of runoff-driven FC fluxes. This hypothesis was conceptualised within a simple FC model that was coupled to a tracer-aided hydrological model developed for a small (3.2 km(2)) data-rich catchment in NE Scotland. The model was dual-calibrated to daily discharge and stable isotope data for the period August 2008 to September 2009; stream FC loads were also simulated but not used as a calibration target. Behavioural models successfully captured the general dynamics of the discharge and isotope data (average Kling-Gupta efficiencies of 0.72 and 0.53, respectively), providing confidence in the realism of simulated hydrological processes. The models simulated a seasonally-varying role of connectivity in driving stream FC loads. In summer, connectivity of the catchment hillslope was crucial in providing a source of FC to the riparian zone for transfer to the stream; this countered the decline in fresh FC input to the riparian zone in summer which reflected the seasonal movement of red deer (the principal source of FC) onto higher ground. In winter when this seasonal movement caused FC to be predominantly stored in the riparian zone, simulated hillslope connectivity primarily provided water to the riparian zone that permitted increased runoff generation and associated mobilisation of FC. Comparison of observed and simulated stream FC loads revealed model performance to be variable (R(2)range: 0-0.34). The better performance of the model in summer was consistent with hydrological connectivity being a dominant control on stream FC loads at this time. However, failure of the model to capture low FC loads in winter indicated that additional processes not considered in the model may also govern stream FC dynamics during this period. Incorporating the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on FC mortality, or a dilution effect of hillslope connectivity in winter, could be potential next steps in refining the hypothesis conceptualised in the FC model presented here. The novel coupled modelling approach used in this study successfully allowed a hypothesised role of connectivity in driving stream FC dynamics to be tested, contextualised by the accuracy of discharge and isotope-tracer simulations as indicators of hydrological process realism. Therefore, coupling FIO and tracer-aided hydrological models has clear promise for furthering understanding of FIO dynamics, which is a vital precursor to the successful management of microbial water quality. Based on the experiences in this study, a ""roadmap"" for the future development and application of coupled approaches is also presented.Show less"

It is important to clarify the coordination relationship and interactive response mechanism between them for sustainable development construction of the Yangtze River Economic Belt.

32,"Winkel, G",Feb 2016 ,Demolishing Dikes: Multiple Streams and Policy Discourse Analysis,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,"The Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) is an influential theoretical framework for the analysis of policymaking processes, in particular agenda setting. It has inspired numerous empirical applications, which result in substantially different interpretations, for instance, of what exactly the streams encompass, how policy entrepreneurship is practiced, and how the coupling of distinct streams works. This article undertakes a systematic assessment of the MSF's core elements from the perspective of policy discourse analysis. Through an understanding of streams as discursive patterns, and policy discourses as (historical) couplings of the streams, a new and theoretically consistent interpretation of streams and likely connections between them is offered. One specific focus is on Kingdon's concept of policy entrepreneurship and how it relates to ideas of agency in discourse analysis. Drawing on the recently proposed Discursive Agency Approach, we discuss how concepts such as subject positions in discourses, agent subjectivization via the dialectic interplay of individual characteristics and structural forces, and discursive practices and strategies relate to and can possibly complement the MSF. Particular emphasis is given to the metaphors the MSF provides. In conclusion, the article demonstrates that a post-positivist perspective holds great potential for enriching the MSF theoretically and strengthening it analytically.Show less"

We investigated the impacts of an assemblage of three taxa (asellids, chironomid larvae, and tubificid worms) on sediment distribution, water fluxes, sediment organic carbon, biofilm (attached bacteria) characteristics, and O-2, dissolved organic carbon NO3-, NO2-, and NH4+ concentrations in slow filtration sand-gravel columns. The results showed that invertebrates clearly modified the distribution of particles in the sediment column, probably because of the structures (tubes, macropores, and faecal pellets) produced by the three taxa in the sediment. Our assessment of water fluxes indicated that invertebrate activities led to an increase in the porosity of the sediment columns. In addition, aerobic (O-2 consumption) and anaerobic (denitrification and fermentative decomposition of organic matter) microbial processes occurring in the sediment were stimulated in the presence of invertebrates. Finally,, the present study demonstrates that invertebrates can act as ecosystem engineers in heterogeneous sediments that are under the influence of an advective flux of water. The solute residence time increased in columns containing the faunal assemblage. Micro-organisms used more dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the presence of invertebrates because invertebrate activities increased the contact between the biofilm and water. We conclude that engineering by invertebrates in natural conditions modifies characteristics of the hyporheic zone and thereby enhances both the porosity of the sediment and the solute transport across the benthic interface.

35,"Mehl, S",Apr 2010 ,Grid-size dependence of Cauchy boundary conditions used to simulate stream-aquifer interactions,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"This work examines the simulation of stream-aquifer interactions as grids are refined vertically and horizontally and suggests that traditional methods for calculating conductance can produce inappropriate values when the grid size is changed. Instead, different grid resolutions require different estimated values. Grid refinement strategies considered include global refinement of the entire model and local refinement of part of the stream. Three methods of calculating the conductance of the Cauchy boundary conditions are investigated. Single- and multi-layer models with narrow and wide streams produced stream leakages that differ by as much as 122% as the grid is refined. Similar results occur for globally and locally refined grids, but the latter required as little as one-quarter the computer execution time and memory and thus are useful for addressing some scale issues of stream-aquifer interactions. Results suggest that existing grid-size criteria for simulating stream-aquifer interactions are useful for one-layer models, but inadequate for three-dimensional models. The grid dependence of the conductance terms suggests that values for refined models using, for example, finite difference or finite-element methods, cannot be determined from previous coarse-grid models or field measurements. Our examples demonstrate the need for a method of obtaining conductances that can be translated to different grid resolutions and provide definitive test cases for investigating alternative conductance formulations.

36,"Ye, S",Nov 2017 ,Scaling Dissolved Nutrient Removal in River Networks: A Comparative Modeling Investigation,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Along the river network, water, sediment, and nutrients are transported, cycled, and altered by coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes. Our current understanding of the rates and processes controlling the cycling and removal of dissolved inorganic nutrients in river networks is limited due to a lack of empirical measurements in large, (nonwadeable), rivers. The goal of this paper was to develop a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical process model to simulate nutrient uptake at the network scale during summer base flow conditions. The model was parameterized with literature values from headwater streams, and empirical measurements made in 15 rivers with varying hydrological, biological, and topographic characteristics, to simulate nutrient uptake at the network scale. We applied the coupled model to 15 catchments describing patterns in uptake for three different solutes to determine the role of rivers in network-scale nutrient cycling. Model simulation results, constrained by empirical data, suggested that rivers contributed proportionally more to nutrient removal than headwater streams given the fraction of their length represented in a network. In addition, variability of nutrient removal patterns among catchments was varied among solutes, and as expected, was influenced by nutrient concentration and discharge. Net ammonium uptake was not significantly correlated with any environmental descriptor. In contrast, net daily nitrate removal was linked to suspended chlorophyll a (an indicator of primary producers) and land use characteristics. Finally, suspended sediment characteristics and agricultural land use were correlated with net daily removal of soluble reactive phosphorus, likely reflecting abiotic sorption dynamics. Rivers are understudied relative to streams, and our model suggests that rivers can contribute more to network-scale nutrient removal than would be expected based upon their representative fraction of network channel length.Show less"

This latter allows the measurement of streaming potential together with the electrical resistance of porous plugs. The conductivity of electrolyte inside plug (pore conductivity) is deduced from electrical resistance measurements and is used together with streaming potential to evaluate the zeta potential by accounting for the surface conduction phenomenon. It is shown that neglecting the surface conduction phenomenon leads to a substantial underestimation of the zeta potential. The coupled measurements of streaming potential and plug electrical resistance yield zeta potential values that are in very good agreement with those obtained by electrophoresis. The densification of the porous plug with increasing pressure increments is put in evidence by the decrease in measured streaming potentials. Electrical resistance measurements make it possible to account for the increase in surface conductivity resulting from the more compacted structure of the plug. By doing so, the calculated zeta potential is found to be virtually independent of the pressure difference involved in streaming potential experiments, whereas the negligence of surface conduction phenomenon leads to a decrease in the apparent zeta potential with increasing pressure level.

Several studies have recommended coupling 1D and 2D models for flood modelling as they provide sufficient descriptive information of floodplains with greater computational efficiency. This study aims to couple a 1D hydrological model (HEC-HMS) with a 2D hydraulic model (iRIC) to simulate flooding in the Nilwala river basin. Hourly rainfall and streamflow data of three flood events were used for calibration and validation of HEC-HMS. The model performed exceptionally well considering the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, percent bias, and root mean square error. The flood event of May 2017 was simulated on iRIC using the streamflow hydrographs modelled by HEC-HMS. An overall accuracy of 81.5% was attained when the simulated extent was compared with the surveyed flood extent. The accuracy of the simulated flood depth was assessed using the observed water level at Tudawa gauging station, which yielded an NSE of 0.94, PBIAS of -4.28, RMSE of 0.18 and R-2 of 0.95. Thus, the coupled model provided an accurate estimate of the flood extent and depth and can be further developed for hydrological flood forecasting on a regional scale.Show less"

To better understand system complexity and system response to changing inputs, ""connectivity thinking"" has become an important recent paradigm within various disciplines including ecology, hydrology and geomorphology. With the presented conceptual connectivity framework on geomorphic change in human-impacted fluvial systems a cautionary note is flagged regarding the need (i) to include and to systematically conceptualise the role of different types of human agency in altering connectivity relationships in geomorphic systems and (ii) to integrate notions of human-environment interactions to connectivity concepts in geomorphology to better explain causes and trajectories of landscape change. Geomorphic response of fluvial systems to human disturbance is shown to be determined by system specific boundary conditions (incl. system history, related legacy effects and lag times), vegetation dynamics and human-induced functional relationships (i.e. feedback mechanisms) between the different spatial dimensions of connectivity. It is further demonstrated how changes in social systems can trigger a process-response feedback loop between social and geomorphic systems that further governs the trajectory of landscape change in coupled human-geomorphic systems.

Greater uptake of inorganic nutrients is expected to be associated with higher rates of metabolism [gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R)], due to assimilatory demand of both autotrophs and heterotrophs. However, relationships between uptake and metabolism should vary with the relative contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of organic matter. To investigate the relationship between metabolism and nutrient uptake, we used whole-stream and benthic chamber methods to measure rates of nitratenitrogen (NO3-N) uptake and metabolism in four headwater streams chosen to span a range of light availability and therefore differing rates of GPP and contributions of autochthonous carbon. We coupled whole-stream metabolism with measures of NO3-N uptake conducted repeatedly over the same stream reach during both day arid night, as well as incubating benthic sediments under both light and dark conditions. NO3-N uptake was generally greater in daylight compared to dark conditions, and although day-night differences in whole-stream uptake were not significant, light-dark differences in benthic chambers were significant at three of the four sites. Estimates of N demand indicated that assimilation by photoautotrophs could account for the majority of NO3-N uptake at the two sites with relatively open canopies. Contrary to expectations, photoautotrophs contributed substantially to NO3-N uptake even at the two closed-canopy sites, which had low values of GPP/R and relied heavily on allochthonous carbon to fuel R.Show less"
42,"Kraft, M",Apr 2019 ,Prioritizing Stream Barrier Removal to Maximize Connected Aquatic Habitat and Minimize Water Scarcity,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Instream barriers, such as dams, culverts, and diversions, alter hydrologic processes and aquatic habitat. Removing uneconomical and aging instream barriers is increasingly used for river restoration. Historically, selection of barrier removal projects used score-and-rank techniques, ignoring cumulative change and the spatial structure of stream networks. Likewise, most water supply models prioritize either human water uses or aquatic habitat, failing to incorporate both human and environmental water use benefits. Here, a dual-objective optimization model identifies barriers to remove that maximize connected aquatic habitat and minimize water scarcity. Aquatic habitat is measured using monthly average streamflow, temperature, channel gradient, and geomorphic condition as indicators of aquatic habitat suitability. Water scarcity costs are minimized using economic penalty functions while a budget constraint specifies the money available to remove barriers. We demonstrate the approach using a case study in Utah's Weber Basin to prioritize removal of instream barriers for Bonneville cutthroat trout, while maintaining human water uses. Removing 54 instream barriers reconnects about 160 km of quality-weighted habitat and costs approximately US$10 M. After this point, the cost-effectiveness of removing barriers to connect river habitat decreases. The modeling approach expands barrier removal optimization methods by explicitly including both economic and environmental water uses.Show less"

While hydrology provides the primary functional control for the wetland ecosystem, the loss of landscape connectivity influences wetland degradation in a major way as it leads to fragmentation. This article aims to integrate hydrogeomorphic and ecological concepts for the assessment of degradation status and its causal factors for a large wetland in the western Ganga plains, India, the Haiderpur, using a wetlandscape approach. We have used a remote-sensing-based approach, which offers a powerful tool for assessing and linking cross-scale structures, functions, and controls in a wetlandscape. The Haiderpur, a Ramsar site since December 2021, is an artificial wetland located on the right bank of the Ganga River wherein the inflows are controlled by a barrage constructed on the Ganga River apart from smaller tributaries flowing in from the north. A novel aspect of this work is the integration of river dynamics and its connectivity to the wetlandscape to understand the spatiotemporal variability in the waterspread area in the wetland. In this work, we have developed an integrated wetlandscape assessment approach by evaluating wetland's geomorphic and hydrological connectivity status for the period 1993-2019 (25 years) across three different spatial scales - regional, catchment, and wetland.

The temperature and concentration of major ions in interstitial water differed very little from those of river water. DO concentrations in interstitial waters were 5.7 +/- 2.2 mg O(2)/l and 3.5 +/- 1.8 mg O(2)/l at the side and dried-up channels, respectively. Concentrations of ammonium and nitrite of both interstitial waters at the side (0.50 +/- 0.17 mu M and 0.13 +/- 0.09 mu M, NH4(+) and NO(2)(-)) and dried-up channels (0.90 +/- 2.14 mu M and 0.27 +/- 0.37 mu M) were lower than those of river water (1.7 +/- 0.8 mu M and 0.73 +/- 0.22 mu M), whereas nitrate (85 +/- 25 mu M at the side channel and 79 +/- 36 mu M at the dried-up channel) did not differ on average from those of river water (70 +/- 12 mu M), though they were often very low (< 10 % of those of river water) at shallow depths of the vegetated areas in the dried-up channel. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in interstitial waters at the dried-up channel (0.84 +/- 0.53 mu M) were lower than those at the side channel (1.9 +/- 0.5 mu M) and those of river water (1.5 +/- 0.5 mu M), and decreased downstream. These results suggest that this aerobic hyporheic zone can serve as a sink for ammonium, nitrite and SRP and to a lesser extent of nitrate. Concentrations of these nutrients in pool water varied greatly but did not differ on average from those of river water. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and SRP concentrations were negatively related to the algal biomass. Pool waters also had lower DIN concentrations at the vegetated areas and higher SPR concentrations at the bar head. These results suggest that nutrient concentrations in pool waters are controlled in a complex manner by algal assimilation and surface-subsurface water exchange. Therefore some pools may serve as a sink and others as a source for nutrients.Show less"

Well-established thermal methods (i.e., analytical and numerical solution of time-series temperature depth-profiles) in combination with Darcy's and electrical resistivity (ER) evaluations were implemented to improve understanding of processes dominating flow and transport in a low permeability and low-flow coastal stream such as Oso Creek, Texas. The seasonal-trend decomposition using Loess (STL) is tested as a potential means to differentiate between advection and conduction and is validated against groundwater fluxes derived from the other well-established thermal methods. The numerical and analytical solutions indicate groundwater upward discharge was 9 mm d(-1) for summer and 3.5 mm d(-1) for winter, corresponding to the region's extreme drought conditions. These types of low flow conditions are usually accompanied by hyporheic flow, limiting the vertical flow assumption. While the numerical and analytical methods provide good insight into streambed hydrology for a low-permeability and low-flow stream in a semiarid coastal area, there are limitations associated with the STL method. The analytical and numerical thermal methods employed herein confirm that conduction and diffusion are the dominant processes of heat and solute transfer in fine-sediment streambeds, providing an improved understanding of process-based groundwater-stream interaction and water resources in this type of settings.

48,"Elosegi, A",Dec 2010 ,Effects of hydromorphological integrity on biodiversity and functioning of river ecosystems,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"River channels tend to a dynamic equilibrium driven by the dynamics of water and sediment discharge. The resulting fluctuating pattern of channel form is affected by the slope, the substrate erodibility, and the vegetation in the river corridor and in the catchment. Geomorphology is basic to river biodiversity and ecosystem functioning since the channel pattern provides habitat for the biota and physical framework for ecosystem processes. Human activities increasingly change the natural drivers of channel morphology on a global scale (e.g. urbanization increases hydrological extremes, and clearing of forests for agriculture increases sediment yield). In addition, human actions common along world rivers impact channel dynamics directly, e.g. river regulation simplifies and fossilizes channel form. River conservation and restoration must incorporate mechanisms of channel formation and ecological consequences of channel form and dynamics. This article (1) summarizes the role of channel form on biodiversity and functioning of river ecosystems, (2) describes spatial complexity, connectivity and dynamism as three key hydromorphological attributes, (3) identifies prevalent human activities that impact these key components and (4) analyzes gaps in current knowledge and identifies future research topics.Show less"
49,"Demars, BOL",Apr 2014 ,"Aquatic Plant Dynamics in Lowland River Networks: Connectivity, Management and Climate Change",WATER,"The spatial structure and evolution of river networks offer tremendous opportunities to study the processes underlying metacommunity patterns in the wild. Here we explore several fundamental aspects of aquatic plant biogeography. How stable is plant composition over time? How similar is it along rivers? How fast is the species turnover? How does that and spatial structure affect our species richness estimates across scales? How do climate change, river management practices and connectivity affect species composition and community structure? We answer these questions by testing twelve hypotheses and combining two spatial surveys across entire networks, a long term temporal survey (21 consecutive years), a trait database, and a selection of environmental variables. From our river reach scale survey in lowland rivers, hydrophytes and marginal plants (helophytes) showed contrasting patterns in species abundance, richness and autocorrelation both in time and space. Since patterns in marginal plants reflect at least partly a sampling artefact (edge effect), the rest of the study focused on hydrophytes. Seasonal variability over two years and positive temporal autocorrelation at short time lags confirmed the relatively high regeneration abilities of aquatic plants in lowland rivers. Yet, from 1978 to 1998, plant composition changed quite dramatically and diversity decreased substantially. The annual species turnover was relatively high (20%-40%) and cumulated species richness was on average 23% and 34% higher over three and five years respectively, than annual survey. The long term changes were correlated to changes in climate (decreasing winter ice scouring, increasing summer low flows) and management (riparian shading). Over 21 years, there was a general erosion of species attributes over time attributed to a decrease in winter ice scouring, increase in shading and summer low flows, as well as a remaining effect of time which may be due to an erosion of the regional species pool. Temporal and spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that long term hydrophyte biomonitoring, for the Water Framework Directive in lowland rivers, may be carried out at 4-6 years intervals for every 10 km of rivers. From multi-scale and abundance-range size analyses evidence of spatial isolation and longitudinal connectivity was detected, with no evidence of stronger longitudinal connectivity (fish and water current propagules dispersal) than spatial isolation (bird, wind and human dispersal) contrary to previous studies. The evidence for longitudinal connectivity was rather weak, perhaps resulting from the effect of small weirs. Further studies will need to integrate other aquatic habitats along rivers (regional species pool) and larger scales to increase the number of species and integrate phylogeny to build a more eco-evolutionary approach. More mechanistic approaches will be necessary to make predictions against our changing climate and management practices.Show less"
