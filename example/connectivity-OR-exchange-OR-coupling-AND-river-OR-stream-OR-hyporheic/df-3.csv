The exchange of water is driven by the local morphology of the streambed (hyporheic exchange) and the regional forcing of a large-scale hydraulic gradient, which results in losing or gaining flow conditions. We measured the effects of losing and gaining flow conditions on hyporheic exchange fluxes in a sandy streambed using a novel laboratory flume system (640 cm long and 30 cm wide) under a combination of average overlying velocities and losing/gaining fluxes. Hyporheic exchange fluxes were analyzed based on a new conceptual framework. This combination of experimental observations and modeling revealed that hyporheic exchange fluxes under losing and gaining flow conditions are similar. Because interfacial transport increases proportionally to the square of the overlying velocity and linearly with increasing fluxes of losing and gaining conditions in the sand bed, the hyporheic exchange flux becomes smaller when the losing or gaining flux increases. Thus, losing and gaining flow conditions become the dominant mechanisms of water exchange at a certain flux, which depends on the competitive interaction between the overlying velocity in the stream and the losing/gaining fluxes.Show less"
1,"Febria, CM",May 2012 ,Bacterial community dynamics in the hyporheic zone of an intermittent stream,ISME JOURNAL,"The dynamics of in situ bacterial communities in the hyporheic zone of an intermittent stream were described in high spatiotemporal detail. We assessed community dynamics in stream sediments and interstitial pore water over a two-year period using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Here, we show that sediments remained saturated despite months of drought and limited hydrologic connectivity. The intermittency of stream surface water affected interstitial pore water communities more than hyporheic sediment communities. Seasonal changes in bacterial community composition was significantly associated with water intermittency, phosphate concentrations, temperature, nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. During periods of low- to no-surface water, communities changed from being rich in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in isolated surface pools, to a few OTUs overall, including an overall decline in both common and rare taxa. Individual OTUs were compared between porewater and sediments. A total of 19% of identified OTUs existed in both porewater and sediment samples, suggesting that bacteria use hyporheic sediments as a type of refuge from dessication, transported through hydrologically connected pore spaces. Stream intermittency impacted bacterial diversity on rapid timescales (that is, within days), below-ground and in the hyporheic zone. Owing to the coupling of intermittent streams to the surrounding watershed, we stress the importance of understanding connectivity at the pore scale, consequences for below-ground and above-ground biodiversity and nutrient processing, and across both short- and long-time periods (that is, days to months to years).

2,"Hill, AR",Sep 1998 ,Hyporheic zone hydrology and nitrogen dynamics in relation to the streambed topography of a N-rich stream,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"The influence of riffle-pool units on hyporheic zone hydrology and nitrogen dynamics was investigated in Brougham Creek, a N-rich agricultural stream in Ontario, Canada. Subsurface hydraulic gradients, differences in background stream and groundwater concentrations of conservative ions, and the movement of a bromide tracer indicated the downwelling of stream water at the head of riffles and upwelling in riffle-pool transitions under base flow conditions. Channel water also flowed laterally into the floodplain at the upstream end of riffles and followed a subsurface concentric flow path for distances of up to 20 m before returning to the stream at the transition from riffles to pools. Differences in observed vs predicted concentrations based on background chloride patterns indicated that the hyporheic zone was a sink for nitrate and a source for ammonium. The removal of nitrate in the streambed was confirmed by the loss of nitrate in relation to co-injected bromide in areas of downwelling stream water in two riffles. Average stream water nitrate-N concentrations of 1.0 mg/L were often depleted to <0.005 mg/L near the sediment-water interface. Consequently, an extensive volume of the hyporheic zone in the streambed and floodplain had a large unused potential for nitrate removal. Conceptual models based mainly on studies of streams with low nutrient concentrations have emphasized the extent of surface-subsurface exchanges and water residence times in the hyporheic zone as important controls on stream nutrient retention. In contrast, we suggest that nitrate retention in N-rich streams is influenced more by the size of surface water storage zones which increase the residence time of channel water in contact with the major sites of rapid nitrate depletion adjacent to the sediment-water interface.Show less"
3,"Schaper, JL",Nov 6 2018 ,Hyporheic Exchange Controls Fate of Trace Organic Compounds in an Urban Stream,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"First-order half-lives for 26 trace organic (TrOCs) were determined in the hyporheic zone (HZ) and along a 3 km reach of a first-order stream in m South Australia during both dry and wet seasons. Two salt in-stream tracer experiments were conducted and evaluated using a transient storage model to characterize seasonal differences in stream residence time and transient storage. Lagrangian and time-integrated surface water sampling were conducted to calculated half-lives in the surface water. Half-lives in the were calculated using porewater samples obtained from a modified mini-point sampler and hyporheic residence times measured via active heat-pulse sensing. Half of the investigated TrOCs (e.g., oxazepam, olmesartan, candesartan) were not significantly removed along both the investigated river stretch and the sampled hyporheic flow paths. The remaining TrOCs (e.g., metformin, guanylurea, valsartan) were found to be significantly removed in the HZ and along the river stretch with relative removals in the HZ correlating to reach-scale relative removals. Using the modeled transport parameters, it was estimated that wet season reach-scale removal of TrOCs was predominately caused by removal in the HZ when the intensity of hyporheic exchange was also higher. Factors that increase HZ exchange are thus likely to promote in-stream reactivity of TrOCs.Show less"
4,"Gooseff, MN",Jun 30 2003 ,Determining long time-scale hyporheic zone flow paths in Antarctic streams,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, glaciers are the source of meltwater during the austral summer, and the streams and adjacent hyporheic zones constitute the entire physical watershed; there are no hillslope processes in these systems. Hyporheic zones can extend several metres from each side of the stream, and are up to 70 cm deep, corresponding to a lateral cross-section as large as 12 m(2), and water resides in the subsurface year around. In this study, we differentiate between the near-stream hyporheic zone, which can be characterized with stream tracer experiments, and the extended hyporheic zone, which has a longer time-scale of exchange. We sampled stream water from Green Creek and from the adjacent saturated alluvium for stable isotopes of D and O-18 to assess the significance and extent of stream-water exchange between the streams and extended hyporheic zones over long time-scales (days to weeks). Our results show that water residing in the extended hyporheic zone is much more isotopically enriched (up to 11parts per thousand D and 2-2parts per thousand O-18) than stream water. This result suggests a long residence time within the extended hyporheic zone, during which fractionation has occurred owing to summer evaporation and winter sublimation of hyporheic water. We found less enriched water in the extended hyporheic zone later in the flow season, suggesting that stream water may be exchanged into and out of this zone, on the time-scale of weeks to months. The transient storage model OTIS was used to characterize the exchange of stream water with the extended hyporheic zone. Model results yield exchange rates (a) generally an order magnitude lower (10(-5) s(-1)) than those determined using stream-tracer techniques on the same stream. In light of previous studies in these streams, these results suggest that the hyporheic zones in Antarctic streams have near-stream zones of rapid stream-water exchange, where 'fast' biogeochemical reactions may influence water chemistry, and extended hyporheic zones, in which slower biogeochemical reaction rates may affect stream-water chemistry at longer time-scales.

5,"Gordon, RP",Apr 2013 ,Spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical cycling around cross-vane restoration structures: Implications for stream restoration design,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Natural channel design restoration projects in streams often include the construction of cross-vanes, which are stone, dam-like structures that span the active channel. Vertical hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) and redox-sensitive solutes were measured in the streambed around four cross-vanes with different morphologies. Observed patterns of HEF and redox conditions are not dominated by a single, downstream-directed hyporheic flow cell beneath cross-vanes. Instead, spatial patterns of moderate (<0.4 m d1) upwelling and downwelling are distributed in smaller cells around pool and riffle bed forms upstream and downstream of structures. Patterns of biogeochemical cycling are controlled by dissolved oxygen concentrations and resulting redox conditions, and are also oriented around secondary bed forms. Strong downwelling into the hyporheic zone (0.53.5 m d1) was observed immediately upstream of structures, but was limited to an area 12 m from the cross-vane; these hyporheic flow paths likely rejoin the stream at the base of cross-vanes after residence times too short to alter nitrate concentrations or accumulate reaction products. Total hyporheic exchange volumes are approximate to 0.4% of stream discharge in restored reaches of 4555 m. Results show that shallow hyporheic flow and associated biogeochemical cycling near cross-vanes is primarily controlled by secondary bed forms created or augmented by the cross-vane, rather than by the cross-vane itself. This study suggests that cross-vane restoration structures benefit the stream ecosystem by creating heterogeneous patches of varying HEF and redox conditions in the hyporheic zone, rather than by processing large amounts of nutrients to alter in-stream water chemistry.Show less"
6,"Hester, ET",Mar 15 2008 ,In-stream geomorphic structures as drivers of hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Common in-stream geomorphic structures such as debris dams and steps can drive hyporheic exchange in streams. Exchange is important for ecological stream function, and restoring function is a goal of many stream restoration projects, yet the connection between in-stream geomorphic form, hydrogeologic setting, and hyporheic exchange remains inadequately characterized. We used the models HEC-RAS, MODFLOW, and MODPATH to simulate coupled surface and subsurface hydraulics in a gaining stream containing a single in-stream geomorphic structure and to systematically evaluate the impact of fundamental characteristics of the structure and its hydrogeologic setting on induced exchange. We also conducted a field study to support model results. Model results indicated that structure size, background groundwater discharge rate, and sediment hydraulic conductivity are the most important factors determining the magnitude of induced hyporheic exchange, followed by geomorphic structure type, depth to bedrock, and channel slope. Model results indicated channel-spanning structures were more effective at driving hyporheic flow than were partially spanning structures, and weirs were more effective than were steps. Across most structure types, downwelling flux rate increased linearly with structure size, yet hyporheic residence time exhibited nonlinear behavior, increasing quickly with size at low structure sizes and declining thereafter. Important trends in model results were observed at the field site and also interpreted using simple hydraulic theory, thereby supporting the modeling approach and clarifying underlying processes.Show less"

8,"Luo, ZL",Jun 2018 ,"Effect of human activity intensity on stream structure and connectivity in Shaying River Basin, China",WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY,"In order to quantify the relationship between human activity intensity and the evolution of stream structure and connectivity, the characteristics of spatial distribution and temporal evolution of stream structure and connectivity in different periods were studied by using river structure parameters and landscape ecology methods. The results indicate the following. (1) The mainstream trend of stream system, with the stream development coefficient decreased by 18.35% and 22.50% for the second- and third-level of stream, is obvious. (2) Human activity intensity has a significant impact on the change of stream structure and connectivity. Under the background of economy domination, the stronger human intervention is, the simpler streamstructure will be, and the poorer streamconnectivity will be. (3) From the view of time series, it is considered that human activities are the main reasons for affecting the change of stream structure and connectivity in the short term, while the natural factors have little effect. (4) The length of low-level streams is more affected by human activities than that of the high-level streams, but water surface ratio is opposite. This study can provide a reference for coordinating the contradiction between socio-economic development and protection of stream systems.Show less"
9,"Cozzetto, K",Feb 2006 ,"Experimental investigations into processes controlling stream and hyporheic temperatures, Fryxell Basin, Antarctica",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Glacial meltwater streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica exhibit daily cycles in temperature with maxima frequently reaching 10-15 degrees C, often 10 degrees C above air temperatures. Hydrologic and biogeochemical processes occurring in these streams and their hyporheic zones strongly influence the flux of water, solutes, and sediment to the ice-covered lakes on the valley bottoms. The purpose of this study was to identify the dominant processes controlling water temperature in these polar desert streams and to investigate in particular the role of hyporheic exchange. In order to do this, we analyzed stream temperature patterns on basin-wide, longitudinal, and reach scales. In the basin-wide study, we examined stream temperature monitoring data for seven streams in the Lake Fryxell Basin. For the longitudinal study, we measured temperatures at seven sites along a 5-km length of Von Guerard Stream.Maximum temperatures in the Fryxell Basin streams ranged from 8 to 15 degrees C. Daily temperature changes in the streams averaged 6-9 degrees C. Stream temperature patterns showed strong diel cycles peaking at roughly the same time throughout the lake basin as well as along the longitudinal gradient of Von Guerard Stream. Further, temperature patterns closely matched the associated net shortwave radiation patterns. Von Guerard Stream experienced its greatest amount of warming, 3-6 degrees C, in a playa region and cooled below snowfields. Temperatures in several streams around Lake Fryxell converged on similar values for a given day as did temperatures in downstream reaches of Von Guerard Stream not influenced by snowfields suggesting that at a certain point instream warming and cooling processes balance one another. The reach-scale investigation involved conducting two dual-injection conservative tracer experiments at mid-day in a 143-m reach of Von Guerard Stream instrumented with temperature and specific conductance probes. In one experiment, snow was added to the stream to suppress the temperature maximum. Chloride data from monitoring wells installed in the streambed showed that streamwater was infiltrating into the streambed and was reaching the frozen boundary. Temperatures in the hyporheic zone were always cooler than temperatures in the stream. OTIS-P modeling of tracer experiment data indicated that significant hyporheic exchange occurred in both experiments. Reach and cross-sectional heat budgets were established with data obtained from the tracer experiments and from a nearby meteorological station. The budgets showed that net radiation accounted for 99% of the warming taking place in the experimental reach. This result, together with the streams' shallow depths and hence rapid response to meteorological conditions, explains the close linkage between stream temperature and net shortwave radiation patterns. Cross-sectional heat budgets also indicated that evaporation, convection, conduction, and hyporheic exchange contributed to 30%, 25-31%, 19-37%, and 6-21%, respectively, of the non-radiative heat losses in the experimental reach. Thus these processes all worked in conjunction to limit stream temperatures in the Dry Valleys' highly exposed environment. This contrasts with other streams in which convection and conduction may play a warming role. The cooling impact of hyporheic exchange was greater in a losing reach than in a gaining one, and increased hyporheic exchange may have lessened the contribution of conduction to the thermal budgets by decreasing streambed temperature gradients. The cooling contributions of evaporation and convection increased with stream temperature and may thus play a role in constraining stream temperature maxima. Finally, our data indicate that streams act as vectors of heat in the Lake Fryxell basin, not only warming the hyporheic zone and eroding the frozen boundary underlying the streams but also accumulating and carrying heat downstream, sending a thermal wave into the lake once a day.

10,"Hill, AR",Feb 1998 ,Hyporheic zone chemistry and stream-subsurface exchange in two groundwater-fed streams,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Data from two headwater streams in southern Ontario provide support for conceptual models that suggest that hyporheic zone influence on stream nutrient retention is determined by the extent of surface-groundwater exchange and subsurface chemical transformation rates. The hyporheic zone (>10% stream water) was delineated by a chemical mixing equation using differences in background stream and groundwater chloride concentrations and by injections of chloride to stream flow. Good agreement between the two methods confirmed that the extent of stream-groundwater exchanges can be successfully estimated using background conservative ions as a tracer technique. During low stream flows in May-October the depth of the hyporheic zone was 2-15 cm in a 12-m sand-bottom pool, debris dam, pool reach of Glen Major stream and 15-20 cm in a 16-m gravel riffle reach of Duffin Creek. Differences between observed NO3 concentrations and concentrations predicted from background chloride indicated depletion of NO3 in the hyporheic zone at a few locations in Glen Major and at 5-10 cm depth throughout the Duffin Creek reach. NO3 and NH4 injected into stream water were reactive at only a few hyporheic sites in the streams. Upstream-downstream comparisons during injections indicated that stream retention was minor.Show less"
11,"Salehin, M",Nov 4 2004 ,Hyporheic exchange with heterogeneous streambeds: Laboratory experiments and modeling,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[ 1] Hyporheic exchange is generally analyzed with the assumption of a homogeneous hyporheic zone. In reality, streambed sediments have a heterogeneous structure, and this natural heterogeneity produces spatially variable interfacial fluxes and complex hyporheic exchange patterns. To assess the basic effects of sediment structure on hyporheic exchange, we performed salt and dye injection experiments in a recirculating laboratory flume with two heterogeneous sediment beds characterized by negative-exponential correlated random hydraulic conductivity fields. Dye injections showed that the hyporheic flow structure was controlled by the spatial relationship of bed forms to high-and low-permeability regions of the streambed. As no existing model could represent these effects, we developed a new finite element model to calculate the pore water flow field resulting from the interaction of the bed form-induced boundary head distribution and the heterogeneous sediment structure. A numerical particle-tracking approach was then used to assess the resulting hyporheic exchange. The combined flow-transport model did an excellent job of predicting the complex hyporheic flow pathways in the heterogeneous bed and the net hyporheic exchange up to t approximate to 30 hours. The heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field caused both greater spatial variability in the water flux through the bed surface and a greater average interfacial flux than would have occurred with a homogeneous bed. The layered correlation structure of the streambed produced an effective anisotropy that favored longitudinal pore water flow and caused a relatively rapid decrease of the mean pore water velocity with depth. As a result, solute penetration into the bed was confined to a more shallow region than would have occurred with a homogeneous bed. The combination of faster near-surface transport and shallower solute penetration produced a shorter mean hyporheic residence time. On the basis of the combination of experimental results and model simulations we conclude that the structural heterogeneity of streambed sediments produces more spatially limited hyporheic exchange that occurs with greater spatial variability and at a higher overall rate.Show less"
12,"Ingendahl, D",Dec 2009 ,Vertical hydraulic exchange and the contribution of hyporheic community respiration to whole ecosystem respiration in the River Lahn (Germany),AQUATIC SCIENCES,"To quantify the contribution of hyporheic community respiration to whole running-water ecosystem respiration in a cultural landscape setting, we studied the vertical hydraulic exchange in riffle-pool sequences of the River Lahn (Germany). We used flow through curves from four tracer experiments to estimate flow velocities in the surface and subsurface water. Generally, vertical exchange velocities were higher in riffle sections and a high temporal variability was observed (range of values 0.11-1.08 m day(-1)). We then used (1) the exchange velocities and (2) time series of dissolved oxygen concentration in surface and subsurface water to calculate hyporheic respiration. Hyporheic respiration was estimated in a range of 10-50 mg O-2 m(-3) day(-1) for the upper sediment layer (first 20 cm). It was much lower in the deeper sediment layer (20-40 cm), ranging from 0 to 10 mg O-2 m(-3) day(-1) (volumes are volumes of interstitial water; the average porosity was 20%). We determined primary production and respiration of the biofilm growing on the sediment by modelling dissolved oxygen concentration time series for a 2,450 m long stream reach (dissolved oxygen concentrations with diurnal variations from 8 to 16 mg L-1). Modelled respiration rates ranged from 2 to 21 g O-2 m(2) day(-1). All information was integrated in a system analysis with numerical simulations of respiration with and without sediments. Results indicated that hyporheic respiration accounted for 6 to 14% of whole ecosystem respiration. These values are much lower than in other whole system respiration studies on more oligotrophic river systems.Show less"
13,"Lautz, LK",Jan 2006 ,Impact of debris dams on hyporheic interaction along a semi-arid stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hyporheic exchange increases the potential for solute retention in streams by slowing downstream transport and increasing solute contact with the substrate. Hyporheic exchange may be a major mechanism to remove nutrients in semi-arid watersheds, where livestock have damaged stream riparian zones and contributed nutrients to stream channels. Debris dams, such as beaver dams and anthropogenic log dams, may increase hyporheic interactions by slowing stream water velocity, increasing flow complexity and diverting water to the subsurface.Here, we report the results of chloride tracer injection experiments done to evaluate hyporheic interaction along a 320 m reach of Red Canyon Creek, a second order stream in the semi-arid Wind River Range of Wyoming. The study site is part of a rangeland watershed managed by The Nature Conservancy of Wyoming, and used as a hydrologic field site by the University of Missouri Branson Geologic Field Station. The creek reach we investigated has debris dams and tight meanders that hypothetically should enhance hyporheic interaction. Breakthrough curves of chloride measured during the field experiment were modelled with OTIS-P, a one-dimensional, surface-water, solute-transport model from which we extracted the storage exchange rate alpha and cross-sectional area of the storage zone A(s) for hyporheic exchange. Along gaining reaches of the stream reach, short-term hyporheic interactions associated with debris dams were comparable to those associated with severe meanders. In contrast, along the non-gaining reach, stream water was diverted to the subsurface by debris dams and captured by large-scale near-stream flow paths. Overall, hyporheic exchange rates along Red Canyon Creek during snowmelt recession equal or exceed exchange rates observed during baseflow at other streams.

14,"Fabian, MW",May 15 2011 ,"Seasonal variation in cascade-driven hyporheic exchange, northern Honduras",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"A characterization of hyporheic exchange for dry and wet season baseflow, as well as partially dewatered discharge, was done in Prieta Creek, a first-order cascade in northern Honduras. The cascade had discharges from 1 to 15 1 s(-1), had average slopes of 12%, pool spacing of 3 m, and shallow substrate of sand and gravel. Tracer tests were conducted in a 15-m sub-reach, a length considered to be adequate for the experiment based on the DaI test, a ratio of exchange and transport processes. In the three tests, between 9 and 18% of tracer was not recovered, possibly due to entrainment in flowpaths passing beneath the downstream monitoring location. Tracer data were analysed by the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) transient storage model (TSM) to derive standard exchange parameters, and by the solute transport in rivers (STIR) model to examine hyporheic residence time distributions (RTDs). The best fit of the observed tracer breakthrough curves was obtained by using the STIR model with a combination of two exponential RTDs to represent hyporheic retention. With increasing discharge, the OTIS model predicted increasing storage exchange fluxes and exchange coefficients and decreasing storage zone areas and transient storage times, which are trends supported by riparian and streambed piezometric head data. Riparian water levels rose during the transition from the dry to wet season, which could constrict the hyporheic storage zone. Thirteen of the 19 streambed piezometers recorded seasonal changes in hydraulic gradients and flux direction, with fewer yet stronger upwelling zones during higher discharges. The MODFLOW model missed the observed seasonal changes, possibly due to subtle changes in the seasonal change in water surface profiles. We conclude that partially dewatered dry season exchange, compared to wet season exchange, was initiated and terminated with smaller pressure gradients and, in different streambed locations, was smaller in volume, had longer residence times, and may connect with deeper and longer flow paths.

15,"Ward, AS",Mar 30 2010 ,Imaging hyporheic zone solute transport using electrical resistivity,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Traditional characterization of hyporheic processes relies upon modelling observed in-stream and subsurface breakthrough curves to estimate hyporheic zone size and infer exchange rates. Solute data integrate upstream behaviour and lack spatial coverage, limiting our ability to accurately quantify spatially heterogeneous exchange dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the application of near-surface electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) methods, coupled with experiments using an electrically conductive stream tracer (dissolved NaCl), to provide in situ imaging of spatial and temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange. Tracer-labelled water in the stream enters the hyporheic zone, reducing electrical resistivity in the subsurface (to which subsurface ERI is sensitive). Comparison of background measurements with those recording tracer presence provides distributed characterization of hyporheic area (in this application, similar to 0.5 m(2)). Results demonstrate the first application of ERI for two-dimensional imaging of stream-aquifer exchange and hyporheic extent. Future application of this technique will greatly enhance our ability to quantify processes controlling solute transport and fate in hyporheic zones, and provide data necessary to inform more complete numerical models.

16,"Cardenas, MB",Jun 27 2009 ,Stream-aquifer interactions and hyporheic exchange in gaining and losing sinuous streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The irregular planform morphology of rivers leads to formation of hyporheic zones along its banks. This study investigates how hyporheic exchange in stream banks, whose planform is idealized as sinusoidal, is affected by net gains from and net losses of water to the adjacent aquifer. These effects are studied via numerical modeling of groundwater flow adjacent to sinuous channels across a broad range of sinuosity and gain/loss magnitude. Hyporheic zone areas and fluxes both decrease exponentially with increasing magnitude of net gain or loss relative to the case where the stream has no net flux of water (neutral). Residence time through the hyporheic zone also decreases with gain/loss magnitude. The hyporheic zones become constrained near the apex of bends, indicating that these areas could be hot spots for mixing and biogeochemical processing. Hyporheic zones in channels with smaller sinuosity are more prone to hyporheic flux and area reduction while very sinuous channels are able to maintain a hyporheic zone even under largely losing or gaining conditions. Equations fitted to the suite of simulation results allow for prediction of hyporheic flux, area, and residence time on the basis of aquifer hydraulic conductivity, channel sinuosity, and the ratio of along-valley and across-valley mean head gradients.Show less"
17,"Hanrahan, TP",Jan 1 2008 ,Effects of river discharge on hyporheic exchange flows in salmon spawning areas of a large gravel-bed river,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The flow magnitude and timing from hydroelectric dams in the Snake River Basin of the Pacific north-western US is managed in part for the benefit of salmon. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of Hells Canyon Dam discharge operations on hydrologic exchange flows between the river and riverbed in Snake River fall Chinook salmon spawning areas. Interactions between river water and pore water within the upper 1 m of the riverbed were quantified through the use of self-contained temperature and water level data loggers suspended inside of piezometers. The data were recorded at 20 min intervals over a period of 200 days when the mean daily discharge was 218-605 m(3) s(-1), with hourly stage changes as large as 1.9 m. Differences in head pressure between the river and rivet-bed were small, often within +/- 2 cm. Measured temperature gradients in the riverbed indicated significant interactions between the surface and subsurface water. At the majority of sites, neither hydraulic not, temperature gradients were significantly affected by either short- or long-term changes in discharge operations from Hells Canyon Dam. Only 2 of 14 study sites exhibited acute flux reversals between the river and riverbed resulting from short-term, large magnitude changes in discharge. The findings suggest that local scale measurements may not be wholly explanatory of the hydrological exchange between the river and riverbed. The processes controlling surface water exchange at the Study sites are likely to be bedform-induced advective pumping, turbulence at the riverbed surface, and large-scale hydraulic gradients along the longitudinal profile of the riverbed. By incorporating the knowledge of hydrological exchange processes into water management planning, regional agencies will be better prepared to manage the limited water resources among competing priorities that include salmon recovery, flood control, irrigation supply, hydropower production, and recreation.

18,"Doughty, M",Aug 2020 ,Mapping increases in hyporheic exchange from channel-spanning logjams,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Human impacts such as timber harvesting, channel engineering, beaver removal, and urbanization alter the physical and chemical characteristics of streams. These anthropogenic changes have reduced the number of fallen trees and amount of loose wood that form blockages in streams. Logjams increase hydraulic resistance and create hydraulic head gradients along the streambed that drive groundwater-surface water exchange. Here, we quantify changes in hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) due to a channel-spanning logjam using field measurements and numerical modeling in MODFLOW and MT3DMS. Electrical resistivity (ER) imaging was used to monitor the transport of solutes into the hyporheic zone during a series of in-stream tracer tests supplemented by in-stream monitoring. We conducted experiments in two reaches in Lithe Beaver Creek, Colorado (USA): one with a single, channel-spanning logjam and the second at a control reach with no logjams. Our results show that 1) higher HEF occurred at the reach with a logjam, 2) logjams created complex HEF pathways that caused bimodal solute breakthrough behavior downstream, and 3) higher discharge rates associated with spring snowmelt increased the extent and magnitude of HEF. Our numerical modeling supported all three field findings, and also suggested that lower flows increased solute retention in streams, although this last conclusion was not supported by field results. This study represents the first use of ER to explore HEF around a naturally occurring logjam over different stream discharges, and has implications for understanding how logjams influence the transport of solutes, the health of stream ecosystems, and stream restoration and conservation efforts.Show less"
19,"Toran, L",Feb 2012 ,Using Hydrogeophysics to Monitor Change in Hyporheic Flow around Stream Restoration Structures,ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE,"Hyporheic exchange is important because water flux through the streambed influences microbial communities and water quality, but little is known about the way in which it changes over time, particularly in response to stream restoration. We used tracer tests and geophysical monitoring, along with streambed characterization, to examine the evolution of the hyporheic zone after construction of a stream restoration structure at Crabby Creek, an urbanized watershed in southeastern Pennsylvania. Changes were assessed by comparing data from 2009 and 2010 over a 13.5 m reach centered on a J-hook. The breakthrough curves from streambed well sampling were remarkably similar in 2009 and 2010, with steep rising and falling limbs indicating rapid exchange followed by a short period (less than 2 hours) of slightly elevated concentration before returning to background levels. The resistivity tomographs of the subsurface showed areas of lingering tracer after the injection stopped. Upstream of the J-hook, there was an area of lingering tracer that persisted for more than 3 hours after the injection stopped. This upstream region of slow exchange was similar for both years. Downstream of the structure, there was lingering tracer in 2009, but a smaller, less intense region in 2010. Streambed characterization showed that 20 cm of erosion occurred in the downstream section between the two years, along with an increased proportion of fines, which was associated with inhibited hyporheic flux.

Using an array of 21 piezometers implanted into an 18 ha meander floodplain, the geochemical properties of shallow groundwater were investigated over nine sampling campaigns between 2011 and 2017. The river is in gaining conditions most of the year, although losing conditions are temporally observed along high river discharge. The objective was to explore the seasonal geochemical variations in response to river discharge with a specific focus on the spatial extent of the hyporheic zone. A thorough examination of temperature, delta O-18, electrical conductivity, and Rn-222 in groundwater indicated that the geochemical properties of shallow groundwater varied in space and time. Multivariate statistical analyses (i.e., clustering and canonical redundancy analysis) showed that river discharge is a key factor controlling shallow groundwater geochemistry, whatever the season. The hyporheic zone, where groundwater mixes with river water, extended far from the riverbank. These results support the concept of the hyporheic corridor and integrated river management by providing a geochemical viewpoint on river-aquifer connectivity.Show less"
21,"McKnight, DM",Jun 2004 ,Inorganic N and P dynamics of Antarctic glacial meltwater streams as controlled by hyporheic exchange and benthic autotrophic communities,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The McMurdo Dry Valleys of South Victoria Land, Antarctica, contain numerous glacial meltwater streams that drain into takes on the valley floors. Many of the streams have abundant perennial mats of filamentous cyanobacteria. The algal mats grow during streamflow in the austral summer and are in a dormant freeze-dried state during the rest of the year. NO3 and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations were lower in streams with abundant algal mats than in streams with sparse algal mats. NO3 and SRP concentrations were higher in the hyporheic zone of a stream with abundant algal mats than in the stream itself. An experimental injection of LiCl, NaNO3, and K3PO4 was conducted in Green Creek, which has abundant algal mats. Substantial hyporheic exchange occurred. The NO3 and PO4 concentrations at 50 m below the injection were 55 muM and 18 muM, respectively, during the experiment. NO3 and PO4 concentrations were below the detection limit of 1 to 2 muM at a site 497 m below the injection during the Cl tracer arrival, indicating a high capacity for nutrient uptake by algal communities. NO2 and NH4 were present at sites 226 and 327 m below the injection, indicating that, in addition to denitrification and algal uptake, dissimilatory NO3 reduction to NO2 and NH4 may be a NO3 sink during transport. Transport modelling with nutrient uptake represented as a 1(st)-order process yielded reach-scale parameters of 4.3 x 10(-5) to 3.9 x 10(-4)/s and 1.4 x 10(-4) to 3.8 x 10(-1)/s for uptake of NO3 and PO4, respectively. The best match with the observed data was a model in which PO4 uptake occurred only in the main channel and NO3 uptake occurred in the main channel and in the hyporheic zone. Hyporheic NO3 uptake was 7 to 16% of the total uptake for the different stream reaches. These results demonstrate that nutrient flux to the lakes is controlled by hyporheic exchange and nutrient uptake by algal mats in dry valley streams. Streams without algal mats contribute more nutrients to the lakes than streams with algal mats.Show less"
22,"Ren, J",Apr 2019 ,An Analysis of the Factors Affecting Hyporheic Exchange based on Numerical Modeling,WATER,"The hyporheic zone is a transition zone for the exchange of matter and energy between surface water and subsurface water. The study of trends and sensitivities of bed hyporheic exchanges to the various influencing factors is of great significance. The surface-groundwater flow process was simulated using a multiphysics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and compared to previous flume experiments. Based on that, the single-factor effects of flow velocity (u), water depth (H), dune wave height (h), and bed substrate permeability () on hyporheic exchange in the bed hyporheic zone were investigated. The sensitivity analysis of various factors (H, u, dune wavelength (L), h, bed substrate porosity (), , and the diffusion coefficient of solute molecules (D-m)) in the surface-subsurface water coupling model was done using orthogonal tests. The results indicated that u, h, and were positively related, whereas H was negatively related to hyporheic exchange. H and u showed large effects, whereas , D-m, and had moderate effects, and L and h showed small effects on hyporheic exchange. This study provides valuable references for the protection and recovery of river ecology.Show less"
23,"Hassan, MA",Jan 30 2015 ,The effects of discharge and slope on hyporheic flow in step-pool morphologies,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This paper focuses on surface-subsurface water exchange in a steep coarse-bedded stream with a step-pool morphology. We use both flume experiments and numerical modelling to investigate the influence of stream discharge, channel slope and sediment hydraulic conductivity on hyporheic exchange. The model step-pool reach, whose topography is scaled from a natural river, consists of three step-pool units with 0.1-m step heights, discharges ranging between base and over-bankfull flows (scaled values of 0.3-4.5 l/s) and slopes of 4% and 8%. Results indicate that the deepest hyporheic flow occurs with the steeper slope and at moderate discharges and that downwelling fluxes at the base of steps are highest at the largest stream discharges. In contrast to findings in a pool-rifflemorphology, those in this study show that steep slopes cause deeper surface-subsurface exchanges than gentle slopes. Numerical simulation results show that the portion of the hyporheic zone influenced by surface water temperature increases with sediment hydraulic conductivity. These experiments and numerical simulations emphasize the importance of topography, sediment permeability and roughness elements along the channel surface in governing the locations and magnitude of downwelling fluxes and hyporheic exchange. Our results show that hyporheic zones in these steep streams are thicker than previously expected by extending the results from streams with pool-riffle bed forms.

24,"Pacioglu, O",Dec 2012 ,Patch scale response of hyporheic invertebrates to fine sediment removal in two chalk rivers,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Groundwater-fed permeable catchments are very susceptible to fine sediment infiltration into the stream bed (colmation), leading to potential reductions in hydraulic conductivity and therefore modification of oxygen and nutrient exchange between hyporheic and surface waters. We investigated the effect of fine sediment (<2 mm) removal on invertebrate assemblages in the shallow hyporheic zones of two chalk rivers using a field experimental approach. We used colonization chambers containing one of two treatments: control and unclogged sediments. Anions, cations and dissolved oxygen did not differ significantly between treatments suggesting good connectivity between surface and hyporheic waters. Total Organic Carbon differed significantly between treatments (p < 0.01) and was higher in the control. In the hyporheic assemblage only Oligochaeta abundance differed significantly between treatments (p < 0.01) and was higher in the control. Overall our study suggests that patch-scale restoration of sediments does not alter hyporheic invertebrate community composition in chalk rivers.Show less"
25,"Ward, AS",Apr 2018 ,"Simulation of dynamic expansion, contraction, and connectivity in a mountain stream network",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Headwater stream networks expand and contract in response to changes in stream discharge. The changes in the extent of the stream network are also controlled by geologic or geomorphic setting - some reaches go dry even under relatively wet conditions, other reaches remain flowing under relatively dry conditions. While such patterns are well recognized, we currently lack tools to predict the extent of the stream network and the times and locations where the network is dry within large river networks. Here, we develop a perceptual model of the river corridor in a headwater mountainous catchment, translate this into a reduced-complexity mechanistic model, and implement the model to examine connectivity and network extent over an entire water year. Our model agreed reasonably well with our observations, showing that the extent and connectivity of the river network was most sensitive to hydrologic forcing under the lowest discharges (Q(gauge) < 1 L s(-1)), that at intermediate discharges (1 L s(-1) < Q(gauge) < 10 L s(-1)) the extent of the network changed dramatically with changes in discharge, and that under wet conditions (Q(gauge) > 10 L s(-1)) the extent of the network was relatively insensitive to hydrologic forcing and was instead determined by the network topology. We do not expect that the specific thresholds observed in this study would be transferable to other catchments with different geology, topology, or hydrologic forcing. However, we expect that the general pattern should be robust: the dominant controls will shift from hydrologic forcing to geologic setting as discharge increases. Furthermore, our method is readily transferable as the model can be applied with minimal data requirements (a single stream gauge, a digital terrain model, and estimates of hydrogeologic properties) to estimate flow duration or connectivity along the river corridor in unstudied catchments. As the available information increases, the model could be better calibrated to match site-specific observations of network extent, locations of dry reaches, or solute break through curves as demonstrated in this study. Based on the low initial data requirements and ability to later tune the model to a specific site, we suggest example applications of this parsimonious model that may prove useful to both researchers and managers.

26,"Movahedi, N",Mar 2021 ,Hyporheic exchanges due to channel bed and width undulations,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Riffle-pool sequences are fundamental, ubiquitous morphological features of alluvial rivers that are thoroughly studied in general and commonly incorporated into river restoration projects. Most previous investigations on the effect of riffle-pool sequences on hyporheic exchanges focused on solely bed undulation, because that is widely thought to be the defining feature of riffle-pool sequences. However, riffle- pool sequences also have significant width undulations that are vital to riffle-pool sequences morphodynamics, yet relatively few studies exist on the effect of such undulations on hyporheic exchanges. Thus, in this study based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, we investigate the effect of bed and width undulations on hyporheic zone characteristics for various ratio of width amplitude to bed amplitude. The variation of hyporheic exchange characteristics (i.e. hyporheic exchange flux and residence time) for different riffle-pool designs were also assessed by creating prescribed topography of synthetic river valleys. The results showed that due to pressure variation along width undulations, the upwelling and downwelling patterns can also be observed for only width undulations in rivers, in the absence of bed undulations, and as width undulation amplitude decreases, the normalized hyporheic exchanges (Q(Hz)*) increase and normalized median residence time (RT*) decreases. Also, simultaneous channel bed and width undulations result in higher Q(Hz)* especially when a pool is located in an expansion (aka ""oversized"" cross-section) and a riffle in a constriction (""nozzle""). Our results suggest that river restoration project that artificially construct wide pools and constricted riffles will achieve maximum Q(Hz)* and RT*, though they will not be geomorphically self-sustainable.Show less"
27,"Morley, SA",Feb 2021 ,Invertebrate and Microbial Response to Hyporheic Restoration of an Urban Stream,WATER,"All cities face complex challenges managing urban stormwater while also protecting urban water bodies. Green stormwater infrastructure and process-based restoration offer alternative strategies that prioritize watershed connectivity. We report on a new urban floodplain restoration technique being tested in the City of Seattle, USA: an engineered hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone has long been an overlooked component in floodplain restoration. Yet this subsurface area offers enormous potential for stormwater amelioration and is a critical component of healthy streams. From 2014 to 2017, we measured hyporheic temperature, nutrients, and microbial and invertebrate communities at three paired stream reaches with and without hyporheic restoration. At two of the three pairs, water temperature was significantly lower at the restored reach, while dissolved organic carbon and microbial metabolism were higher. Hyporheic invertebrate density and taxa richness were significantly higher across all three restored reaches. These are some of the first quantified responses of hyporheic biological communities to restoration. Our results complement earlier reports of enhanced hydrologic and chemical functioning of the engineered hyporheic zone. Together, this research demonstrates that incorporation of hyporheic design elements in floodplain restoration can enhance temperature moderation, habitat diversity, contaminant filtration, and the biological health of urban streams.Show less"
28,"Calfe, ML",Feb 2022 ,Nitrate removal by watershed-scale hyporheic stream restoration: Modeling approach to estimate effects and patterns at the stream network scale,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Excess nutrient pollution and eutrophication are widespread, and stream restoration is increasingly implemented as a solution. Yet few studies evaluate the cumulative effects of multiple individual restoration projects on watershed-scale nutrient loading. We developed a new modeling approach linking the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) to an auxiliary R script that simulates hyporheic exchange. We used the modeling approach to simulate hyporheic enhancement by in-stream restoration features (e.g., structures, pool-riffles, gravel bars) implemented throughout a generic 4th-order gaining watershed in the eastern USA. We assumed groundwater was widely impacted by nitrate, thus the primary pollutant source was baseflow gaining. Model results indicated that hyporheic restoration throughout all streams of our 4th-order watershed would reduce nitrate loading to downstream waterbodies by -83%. This percentage assumes removal of all nitrate that enters the hyporheic zone and is for a gravel/sand bed, so reductions would be smaller with finer sediments or incomplete removal. For example, when we reduced the hyporheic exchange rate by an order of magnitude, the maximum watershed nitrate load reduction decreased to -25%. The relationship between the percent of watershed stream channels that have been restored and percent nitrate load reduction at the watershed outlet was nonlinear. This relationship was exponential in smaller streams (1st- and 2nd-order) due to efficient removal of all incoming nitrate, but became linear in larger streams (3rd- and 4th-order) due to ""recycling"" of channel flow through the hyporheic zone more than once. Yet restoration was more effective at overall nitrate load reduction in larger (e.g., 3rd-4th order) streams because the majority of nitrate enters the watershed through groundwater gaining in those larger streams. Thus, the location of restoration projects within a watershed is important in determining their effect on nitrate loads at the watershed outlet. Overall, our results indicate hyporheic restoration can significantly reduce watershed nitrate loading to downstream waterbodies, yet watersheds must be viewed as a whole to understand the potential impacts of any particular project under consideration.Show less"
29,"Merill, L",2014 ,"A Review of the Hyporheic Zone, Stream Restoration, and Means to Enhance Denitrification",CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"The hyporheic zone is the subsurface area below and adjacent to a stream where groundwater mixes with stream water, through vertical, lateral, and longitudinal flows. The hyporheic zone connects the stream to uplands and other terrestrial environments. It is a zone of distinct faunal communities, high biological diversity and ecological complexity, and is the site of chemical processing and transformations of ground- and stream waters. The hyporheic zone is important to the overall ecosystem ecology of the stream, and it can influence stream water chemistry. Flows, reactions, and biota in the hyporheic zone are heterogeneous and patchy, making it difficult to clearly describe the ecotone in a straightforward, general way. Nitrogen processing, especially denitrification, appears to be widespread in the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone, as with most aquatic systems, is often impacted by human activities. Stream restorations rarely consider potential effects on the hyporheic zone, but careful project choices can enhance the condition of the hyporheic zone, and so increase uptake of nitrogen by stream-associated environments as partial mitigation of continuing and increasing releases of reactive nitrogen, potentially reaping short-term benefits to estuarine environments that may not be as quickly realized from source control measures.Show less"
30,"Hester, ET",Aug 2014 ,Variation of Hyporheic Potential among Urban Region Streams: Implications for Stream Restoration,ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE,"Bidirectional (hyporheic) exchange of water between stream channels and sediments benefits stream ecosystems, yet the effects of urbanization on such exchange are poorly understood. Exchange is controlled by a set of geomorphic parameters collectively defined as ""hyporheic potential,"" including sediment hydraulic conductivity (K), vertical undulations of the streambed (VC), and channel sinuosity (S). We measured these hyporheic potential metrics in 10 stream reaches with varying percent impervious surface (0-47 percent) in their contributing watersheds. We performed linear regression between hyporheic potential metrics and two metrics of urbanization: percent impervious in the watershed and average riparian forest buffer width. We found that most trends between hyporheic potential metrics and both urbanization metrics were noisy, with low r(2). Furthermore, hyporheic potential varied as much among our streams as in non-urban studies, and K varied as much within stream reaches as between stream reaches. These results collectively indicate that the effects of urbanization on hyporheic potential in our streams were minimal and that urbanization may not heavily constrain hyporheic exchange. Nevertheless, we did find that S increased with impervious cover in the contributing watershed, consistent with higher urban storm flows leading to sinuosity adjustments to reduce channel slope. Urbanization may therefore enhance hyporheic potential under certain circumstances, and bears further study. Furthermore, there may be value in increasing the benefits of hyporheic exchange above existing levels through ""hyporheic enhancement."" Because K varied more among streams than VC, which varied more than S, efforts to enhance hyporheic exchange may have greatest effect if they manipulate K.Show less"
31,"Song, JX",Mar 2019 ,Estimating spatial pattern of hyporheic water exchange in slack water pool,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,"Hyporheic zone (HZ) influences hydraulic and biogeochemical processes in and alongside streams, therefore, investigating the controlling geographic factors is beneficial for understanding the hydrological processes in HZ. Slack water pool (SWP) is an essential micro-topographic structure that has an impact on surface water and groundwater interactions in the HZ during and after high flows. However, only a few studies investigate HZ surface water and groundwater exchange in the SWP. This study used the thermal method to estimate the HZ water exchange in the SWP in a segment of the Weihe River in China during the winter season. The findings show that on the flow-direction parallel to the stream, river recharge dominates the HZ water exchange, while on the opposing flow-direction bank groundwater discharge dominates the water exchange. The water exchange in the opposing flow-direction bank is about 1.6 times of that in the flow-direction bank. The HZ water exchange is not only controlled by flow velocity but also the location and shape of the SWP. Great water exchange amount corresponds to the shape with more deformation. The maximum water exchange within the SWP is close to the river bank where the edge is relatively high. This study provides some guidelines for water resources management during flooding events.Show less"
32,"Behzadi, F",Oct 2021 ,Bed form-induced hyporheic exchange and geochemical hotspots,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Small-scale bed form topographies control hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical processes within aquatic sediments, which ultimately affect water quality and nutrient cycling at the watershed scale. The impact of threedimensional and small-scale bed form topographies on hyporheic exchange and solute mixing is investigated in the present work. The effect of bed form morphologies on the development of zones of enhanced reaction rates (i. e., hotspots) is also studied. A computational fluid dynamics model to simulate river flow over bed forms is combined with a subsurface flow and multicomponent reactive solute transport model. A wide variety of bed form topographies are generated using geometric models by varying parameters controlling curvature as well as bed form wavelength and amplitude. The results in this research suggest that out-of-phase bed forms generate more complex hyporheic flow patterns which reduce the efficiency of solute transformations. Higher phase shifts in bed form shapes result in overall higher average velocity, larger zones of enhanced pressure and reaction rates, and higher amounts of solute exchange. Moreover, the bed form shapes control the reaction process for a wide range of sediment conductivities. This study advances the understanding of the effects of complex and small scale morphological features on hyporheic exchange processes including the rate and spatio-temporal distribution of reaction hotspots.Show less"
33,"Schmadel, NM",Jul 2017 ,Hydrologic controls on hyporheic exchange in a headwater mountain stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The spatial and temporal scales of hyporheic exchange within the stream corridor are controlled by stream discharge and groundwater inflow interacting with streambed morphology. While decades of study have resulted in a clear understanding of how morphologic form controls hyporheic exchange at the feature scale, we lack comparable predictive power related to stream discharge and the spatial structure of groundwater inflows at the reach scale, where spatial heterogeneity in both geomorphic setting and hydrologic forcing are present. In this study, we simulated vertical hyporheic exchange along a 600 m mountain stream reach under high, medium, and low stream discharge while considering groundwater inflow as negligible, spatially uniform, or proportional to upslope accumulated area. Most changes to hyporheic flow path residence time or length in response to stream discharge were small (<5%), suggesting that discharge is a secondary control relative to morphologically driven hyporheic exchange. Groundwater inflow was a primary control and mostly caused decreases in hyporheic flow path residence time and length. This finding generally agrees with expectations from the literature; however, flow path response was not consistent across the study reach. Instead, we found that flow paths driven by large hydraulic gradients coinciding with large morphologic features were less sensitive to changes in groundwater inflow than those driven by hydraulic gradients similar to the valley gradient. Our results indicate that consideration of heterogeneous arrangement of morphologic features is necessary to differentiate between hyporheic flow paths that persist in time and those that are sensitive to changing hydrologic conditions.Show less"

Yet no routine water chemistry samples are taken from riverbed substrate, despite many interstitial species being dependant on specific physicochemical conditions. This paper examines water and nutrient exchanges between stream and substrate, the hyporheic zone, and the consequent alteration to the chemistry of interstitial and in-stream waters, which in turn leads to small-scale but significant changes in habitat. Bed topography, principally a pool-riffle sequence, was surveyed and hydraulically sampled to examine the hyporheic flow pathways generated between the stream, substrate, and groundwater-creating an ecotone. Hyporheic zone, in-stream and groundwater hydrochemistry, and hydraulic measures were assessed at a braided woodland river reach using a dense monitoring approach. The findings demonstrate that through a 23-m pool-riffle sequence, where water infiltrates at the riffle-head and subsequently exfiltrates at the riffle-tail, there is a 5% reduction in mean in-stream nitrate-N and a 73% reduction in hyporheic zone concentration. When calcium-enriched riffle-tail exfiltrate meets riffle-runoff water that is turbulently oxygenated from riffle-flow, an interstitial redoxcline is created. Dissolved oxygen nocturnally drops, with photosynthetic rate reduction, which causes hyporheic nitrate-N to double its daytime concentration. The results are related to the Yorkshire River Esk freshwater pearl mussels, Margaritifera margaritifera Linnaeus (1758), a declining endangered species. At present, scant monitoring of interstitial hydrochemistry and diurnal change across stream and substrate occurs.Show less"

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of discharge on hyporheic water quality in a regulated Swedish boreal river during a 10-day experimental period with a sequence of alternating high- and low-flow episodes. A 250 m reach was instrumented with 28 piezometers placed at 150 and 300 turn below the river bed or below the mean groundwater level in the floodplain, and these piezometers were used to measure temperature, oxygen, electric conductivity and pH. High daily variation in air temperature during the first 3 days was transmitted vertically through the stream water into the hyporheic zone within hours. An oxygen saturation of 100% in the river water corresponded to 60-70% saturation at 150 mm depth and 30% at 300 mm depth. The hyporheic oxygen concentration at 150 mm depth decreased during the experimental period, falling into a range that is potentially harmful to incubating salmonid eggs. This was interpreted as a long-term response to the overall regulation regime, rather than a response to short-term water regulation during the experiment. Even though the effect of short-term regulation on the quality of hyporheic water in the river bed was limited, there was a more pronounced effect on the quality of floodplain hyporheic water. Most of the driving forces for temporal variation of water quality in the river bed came vertically from the river water, rather than from the lateral exchange.

36,"Calles, O",Oct 2007 ,Temporal and spatial variation in quality of hyporheic water in one unregulated and two regulated boreal rivers,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"This study describes the temporal and spatial variations in hyporheic water quality in three boreal rivers, the River Tobyalven, an unregulated river, the river Mangalven, a regulated river with a minimum discharge requirement and the river Jarperudsalven, a regulated river without any minimum discharge requirements. A total of 43 permanent piezometers were used to measure dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, NO3- and NH4+ in the hyporheic water at 150 mm and 300 mm depth, at monthly intervals from October 2001 to October 2002. Another seven piezometers were installed in brown trout redds and monitored during the incubation period, from December 2001 to April 2002. In the river Tobyalven, temporal patterns in hyporheic water chemistry correlated to variations in surface water chemistry and discharge. In the river Jarperudsalven, the hyporheic water chemistry did not correlate to discharge or surface water chemistry. In the river Mangalven, the water chemistry was dominated by releases from a large upstream lake, and there were weak correlations between surface water chemistry and hyporheic water chemistry at some sites. The incubation conditions for brown trout eggs were most favourable in the unregulated river, characterized by high DO levels that remained high throughout the incubation period. In the river Jarperudsalven the DO levels were variable during spawning, and then gradually declined to critically low levels during incubation, whereas in the river Mangalven the DO conditions were intermediate and stable. Thus we observed a stronger coupling between surface water conditions and hyporheic conditions, i.e. vertical connectivity, in the unregulated river than in the regulated river with minimum flow requirements, which in turn was stronger than in the river without minimum flow requirements.

37,"Goodrich, DC",Apr 2018 ,Southwestern Intermittent and Ephemeral Stream Connectivity,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Ephemeral and intermittent streams are abundant in the arid and semiarid landscapes of the Western and Southwestern United States (U.S.). Connectivity of ephemeral and intermittent streams to the relatively few perennial reaches through runoff is a major driver of the ecohydrology of the region. These streams supply water, sediment, nutrients, and biota to downstream reaches and rivers. In addition, they provide runoff to recharge alluvial and regional groundwater aquifers that support baseflow in perennial mainstem stream reaches over extended periods when little or no precipitation occurs. Episodic runoff, as well as groundwater inflow to surface water in streams support limited naturally occurring riparian communities. This paper provides an overview and comprehensive examination of factors affecting the hydrologic, chemical, and ecological connectivity of ephemeral and intermittent streams on perennial or intermittent rivers in the arid and semiarid Southwestern U.S. Connectivity as influenced and moderated through the physical landscape, climate, and human impacts to downstream waters or rivers is presented first at the broader Southwestern scale, and secondly drawing on a specific and more detailed example of the San Pedro Basin due to its history of extensive observations and research in the basin. A wide array of evidence clearly illustrates hydrologic, chemical, and ecological connectivity of ephemeral and intermittent streams throughout stream networks.Show less"

Vegetation, which is ubiquitous in nature, is known to impact hyporheic exchange; yet how vegetation impacts hyporheic exchange remains to be characterized. Here, we show that at the same spatially and temporally-averaged flow velocity U $U$, vegetation increases the rate of hyporheic exchange by a factor of four. By tracking the movement of fluorescent dye in a flume with the refractive-index-matched sediment and translucent vegetation dowels, we demonstrate that the vegetation-induced hyporheic exchange can be characterized by an effective hyporheic exchange velocity, VH ${V}_{H}$. We further demonstrate that VH ${V}_{H}$ correlates with the total near-bed turbulent kinetic energy kt ${k}_{t}$ rather than U $U$, when kt<6x10-4m2/s2 ${k}_{t}< 6\times {10}<^>{-4}\,{\mathrm{m}}<^>{2}/{\mathrm{s}}<^>{2}$, indicating that turbulent kinetic energy is a better metric than flow velocity for predicting hyporheic exchange in regions with vegetation.Show less"

In the field, physicochemical parameters were measured along a 10 m-long hyporheic flow line between downwelling and upwelling zones. Sediment cores were retrieved from the stream bed surface, and from 20, 40 and 60 cm deep in each zone, and in the laboratory, water from the corresponding depth was percolated through each core at the natural flow rate. Concentrations of nitrogen species and oxygen were measured before and after flow through each core. Denitrification was measured using a N-15-nitrate tracer. Shallow and downwelling zone samples were clearly distinct from deeper and upwelling zone samples in terms of physicochemical conditions, microbial processes and factors controlling nitrogen processing. Denitrification was highest in surface and downwelling zone cores, despite high oxygen levels, probably due to high pore-water nitrate concentrations in these cores and isolation of the denitrifying bacteria from oxygen in the bulk water by the hyporheic biofilms. Denitrification was limited by oxygen inhibition in the downwelling group, and by nitrate availability in the upwelling group. Strong evidence indicated that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, occurred in almost all cores, and outcompeted denitrification for nitrate. In contrast, nitrification was undetectable in all but two cores, probably because of intense competition for oxygen. Field patterns and lab experiments indicated that the hyporheic zone at this moderately N-rich site is a strong sink for nitrate, fitting current theories that predict where hyporheic zones are nitrate sinks or nitrate sources.Show less"
40,"Faulkner, BR",Jul 2 2012 ,Hyporheic flow patterns in relation to large river floodplain attributes,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Field-calibrated models of hyporheic flow have emphasized low-order headwater systems. In many cases, however, hyporheic flow in large lowland river floodplains may be an important contributor to ecosystem services such as maintenance of water quality and habitat. In this study, we used a network of shallow monitoring wells, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and continuous monitoring to parameterize and calibrate stochastic three-dimensional ground water models for a 9.7 km(2) (2400 acres) area along a naturally-meandering section of the Willamette River floodplain in Oregon. This large river floodplain is representative of other similar systems. Steady-state simulations were done representing the wet winter and dry summer seasons. During the dry season, hyporheic flow was oriented along the floodplain elevation gradient and median steady-state residence times in small islands and bars were on the order of months. In the larger islands steady-state residence times were on the order of years. In the wet season, flow was oriented laterally away from the river and quickly intercepted and returned to the surface water system in alcoves and cutoffs connected to the river, and recharge due to infiltration of precipitation prevented hyporheic flow through older island areas. In the younger islands, median steady-state residence times ranged from about 6.1 x 10(1) to 1.6 x 10(2) days. In the model domain overall, the steady-state dry season median pathline length was about 8.2 x 10(2) with a maximum length of about 5.7 x 10(3) m. For the wet season, the median was about 2.0 x 10(2) m with a maximum length of about 3.5 x 10(3) m. Wet season hyporheic water penetrated deeper into the lower permeability geologic units by an order of magnitude, as compared to the dry season. This was likely due to the absence of precipitation infiltration during the dry season. We used particle tracking in order to characterize residence time distributions for hyporheic water. We found two behaviors: lognormal decay with shorter distributions of residence times, and heavy tailing, following power-law behavior. Interestingly, we found the heavy tailing behavior more during the wet season when mean residence times were short. This result implies that even though some rates of hyporheic flow were relatively fast, there were also zones of relatively stagnant water causing this large variation in residence time. Observed slopes for log-log plots of the histograms fell in the range of 2.3-5.6. This behavior appeared to be restricted to regions affected by natural river meandering, where avulsions create isolated islands. In some areas, land managers may consider revetment removal as a means to convert channelized systems to more natural systems with shallower depths in the main channel, meander scrolls, and alcoves that can enhance hyporheic flow. The results of this study provide information on how such decisions may affect the extent of hyporheic flow that may occur as a large river returns to its natural geomorphological dynamics.

41,"Clilverd, HM",Mar 2008 ,Nitrogen retention in the hyporheic zone of a glacial river in interior Alaska,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"We examined the hydrologic controls on nitrogen biogeochemistry in the hyporheic zone of the Tanana River, a glacially-fed river, in interior Alaska. We measured hyporheic solute concentrations, gas partial pressures, water table height, and flow rates along subsurface flowpaths on two islands for three summers. Denitrification was quantified using an in situ (NO3-)-N-15 push-pull technique. Hyporheic water level responded rapidly to change in river stage, with the sites flooding periodically in mid-July to early-August. Nitrate concentration was nearly 3-fold greater in river (ca. 100 mu g NO3--N l(-1)) than hyporheic water (ca. 38 mu g NO3--N l(-1)), but approximately 60-80% of river nitrate was removed during the first 50 m of hyporheic flowpath. Denitrification during high river stage ranged from 1.9 to 29.4 mg N kg sediment(-1) day(-1). Hotspots of methane partial pressure, averaging 50,000 ppmv, occurred in densely vegetated sites in conjunction with mean oxygen concentration below 0.5 mgO(2) l(-1). Hyporheic flow was an important mechanism of nitrogen supply to microbes and plant roots, transporting on average 0.41 gNO(3)(-) -N m(-2) day(-1), 0.22 gNH(4)(+) -N m(-2) day(-1), and 3.6 g DON m(-2) day(-1) through surface sediment (top 2 m). Our results suggest that denitrification can be a major sink for river nitrate in boreal forest floodplain soils, particularly at the river-sediment interface. The stability of the river hydrograph and the resulting duration of soil saturation are key factors regulating the redox environment and anaerobic metabolism in the hyporheic zone.Show less"
42,"Chow, R",May-jun 2019 ,Sensitivity of Simulated Hyporheic Exchange to River Bathymetry: The Steinlach River Test Site,GROUNDWATER,"This study determines the aspects of river bathymetry that have the greatest influence on the predictive biases when simulating hyporheic exchange. To investigate this, we build a highly parameterized HydroGeoSphere model of the Steinlach River Test Site in southwest Germany as a reference. This model is then modified with simpler bathymetries, evaluating the changes to hyporheic exchange fluxes and transit time distributions. Results indicate that simulating hyporheic exchange with a high-resolution detailed bathymetry using a three-dimensional fully coupled model leads to nested multiscale hyporheic exchange systems. A poorly resolved bathymetry will underestimate the small-scale hyporheic exchange, biasing the simulated hyporheic exchange towards larger scales, thus leading to overestimates of hyporheic exchange residence times. This can lead to gross biases in the estimation of a catchment's capacity to attenuate pollutants when extrapolated to account for all meanders along an entire river within a watershed. The detailed river slope alone is not enough to accurately simulate the locations and magnitudes of losing and gaining river reaches. Thus, local bedforms in terms of bathymetric highs and lows within the river are required. Bathymetry surveying campaigns can be more effective by prioritizing bathymetry measurements along the thalweg and gegenweg of a meandering channel. We define the gegenweg as the line that connects the shallowest points in successive cross-sections along a river opposite to the thalweg under average flow conditions. Incorporating local bedforms will likely capture the nested nature of hyporheic exchange, leading to more physically meaningful simulations of hyporheic exchange fluxes and transit times.Show less"
43,"Marmonier, P",Apr 2010 ,Hyporheic flowpaths and interstitial invertebrates associated with stable and eroded river sections: interactions between micro- and meso-scales,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Erosion of the river beds linked to human activities is currently a crucial issue. By inducing strong changes in river dynamics, this erosion alters many of the related ecological processes. The modification of the relationships between the river and its aquifer due to erosion is not really understood. The large scale consequences of erosion for the interactions between river and the underlying aquifer must be clarified, together with the small scale effects of river erosion on hyporheic flowpaths. The role of water exchange within the hyporheic zone on the distribution of interstitial invertebrates is universally recognized, but nothing is known on the potential links between riverbed erosion, the subsequent modification of water exchange at a local scale and their consequences on the distribution and biomass of hyporheic invertebrates.Two sections, stable versus eroded, were studied on the Herbasse, a third-order stream, by sampling hyporheic water and invertebrates at two depths within the substrate (-15 and -50 cm deep), upstream and downstream of ten riffles. Seven physical and chemical parameters were used to identify the hydrological flowpaths at both the riffle (up and downwelling areas) and the section scales (eroded vs stable) and to specify the level of nutrients in the hyporheic habitat.Significant differences were observed between the stable and eroded sections both in the vertical and longitudinal dimensions, with for example available oxygen decreasing with depth and along hyporheic flowpaths, and revealing more obvious differences in the eroded section gaining groundwater than in the stable section. Most of the hypogean organisms (Niphargus sp., Salentinella juberthiei, and Proasellus sp.) were most abundant at the deepest level, in the upwelling zones and the eroded section, while typical epigean taxa (Gammarus sp., Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera) were mostly present near the surface and in the stable section, suggesting that erosion processes may influence the development of hyporheic assemblages at riffle and reach scales.Show less"
44,"Drummond, JD",Oct 13 2020 ,Significance of Hyporheic Exchange for Predicting Microplastic Fate in Rivers,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS,"Microplastics are abundantly found in streambed sediments, including both small and low-density particles of neutral and positive buoyancy. Although the flow of water into streambed sediments (hyporheic exchange) has previously been shown to increase the rate of delivery of fine particles to the streambed, the influence of hyporheic exchange on microplastic fate in aquatic environments has not yet been assessed in detail. Here we evaluate the effects of hyporheic exchange on microplastics by calculating and comparing the rates of delivery of microplastics to streambed sediments by hyporheic exchange and gravitational settling for combinations of particle size and density most commonly found in streams. In a field stream study, we found that 23% of all microplastic combinations have a hyporheic exchange rate that is higher than their settling rate. This fraction was as high as 42% for microplastics composed of low-density polymers, such as polyethylene. We then expand these findings to consider a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions in rivers and demonstrate that hyporheic exchange is important for the transport and fate of particles that are <100 mu m in diameter, irrespective of polymer type. Models that do not include hyporheic exchange are therefore likely to substantially underestimate the deposition, retention, and long-term accumulation of microplastics in streambed sediments.Show less"
45,"Kaser, DH",Feb 15 2014 ,Prospective modelling of 3D hyporheic exchange based on high-resolution topography and stream elevation,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"River managers and scientists interested in hyporheic processes need adequate tools for characterizing hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) at local sites where only poor information on subsurface properties are available. This study evaluates a three-dimensional modelling approach, on the basis of detailed surface parameterization and a simplified subsurface structure, for comparison of potential HEF characteristics at three experimental reaches at the channel-unit scale. First, calibration is conducted to determine the best fit-of-heads given the model simplification, then the structure of residuals are used to evaluate the origin of the misfit, and finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify inter-site differences in HEF. Results show that such an approach can highlight potential magnitude differences in HEF characteristics between reaches. The sensitivity analysis is successful in delineating the small area of exchange that remains under conditions of high groundwater discharge. In this case, however, the calibrated model performs poorly in representing the exchange pattern at the sediment-water interface, thus suggesting that the approach is less adequate for a deterministic simulation of observed heads. The summary statistics are in the range of similar published models, for which the reported indicator is the root mean square error on heads normalized by the head drop over the reach. We recommend, however, that modellers use a more comparable indicator, such as a measure of the residuals normalized by a measure of observed vertical head differences. Overall, when subsurface data are unavailable or sparse, a three-dimensional groundwater model based on high-resolution topographic data combined with a sensitivity analysis appears as a useful tool for a preliminary characterization of HEF.

46,"Boulton, AJ",1998 ,The functional significance of the hyporheic zone in streams and rivers,ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS,"The hyporheic zone is an active ecotone between the surface stream and groundwater. Exchanges of water, nutrients, and organic matter occur in response to variations in discharge and bed topography and porosity. Upwelling subsurface water supplies stream organisms with nutrients while downwelling stream water provides dissolved oxygen and organic matter to microbes and invertebrates in the hyporheic zone. Dynamic gradients exist at all scales and vary temporally. At the microscale, gradients in redox potential control chemical and microbially mediated nutrient transformations occurring on particle surfaces. At the stream-reach scale, hydrological exchange and water residence time are reflected in gradients in hyporheic faunal composition, uptake of dissolved organic carbon, and nitrification. The hyporheic corridor concept describes gradients at the catchment scale, extending to alluvial aquifers kilometers from the main channel. Across all scales, the functional significance of the hyporheic zone relates to its activity and connection with the surface stream.Show less"
47,"Kazezyilmaz-Alhan, CM",Sep 30 2006 ,Stream solute transport incorporating hyporheic zone processes,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The behavior of solute transport in pool and riffle, or meandering types of streams, is greatly influenced by surface/subsurface flow and solute transport interactions. It is important to model these processes accurately in rivers and streams to improve downstream water quality. Two decades ago, Bencala and Walters (1983) [Bencala, K. E., Walters, R.A., 1983, Simulation of solute transport in a mountain pool-and-riffle stream - a transient storage model. Water Resources Research 19(3), 718-724] introduced the transient storage model to represent the movement of solute from main streams into stagnant zones and back to the main stream. This model includes the effect of both surface storage, in which water is stationary relative to the main channel and the hyporheic zone, to which water moves from the main channel, flows through and returns to the main channel. However, their simplified approach lumped the surface storage and hyporheic zones together in a single storage zone. In this study, we take a step towards a mechanistic model to explain the physics of water exchange between the surface water and the porous media by developing an improved mathematical model. For this purpose, we include the advection and dispersion processes into the transient storage zone, and we consider the hyporheic zone as a transient porous media from surface water to ground water. We use this improved model to solve a test problem in order to demonstrate its capabilities. Finally, we simulate the Uvas Creek experiment and compare our results to the observations described in Bencala and Walters (1983) [Bencala, K.E., Walters, R.A., 1983, Simulation of solute transport in a mountain pool-and-riffle stream - a transient storage model.

48,"Zhang, Y",Nov 2017 ,Movement of lateral hyporheic flow between stream and groundwater,SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES,"The hyporheic zone plays an important role in groundwater and stream water quality protection. To investigate the stream-groundwater interaction mechanisms in the lateral hyporheic zone, this study examined Ma'an Creek in Chongqing during the dry season from December 2015 to April 2016. The water level, water temperature, pH and Cl- concentration in the hyporheic zone and groundwater were monitored in situ. The sediment permeability coefficient, stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and concentration of DOC were analyzed. The results show that the water level changes of hyporheic zone and the movement of hyporheic flow were influenced significantly by the permeability coefficient of sediment. The hyporheic flow approximately 10 cm from the stream bank was clearly affected by precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration. During the study period, the groundwater recharged the stream, and the impact of groundwater on the hyporheic flow gradually decreased with the flow path. The hyporheic flow approximately 30 cm from the stream bank was still mainly affected by groundwater. Approximately 10-30 cm from the stream bank, the mixing of groundwater with precipitation and stream water intensified. Due to the sediment properties, moisture accumulated approximately 10 cm from the stream bank and drained into the stream via hyporheic flow, with potential impacts on stream water quality.Show less"
49,"Wagenhoff, A",Oct 2 2014 ,Does large woody debris affect the hyporheic ecology of a small New Zealand pasture stream?,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"Rehabilitation of vertical hydrological exchange in small pasture streams is expected to improve hyporheic habitat, invertebrate life and ecosystem functioning, and may be achieved by adding large woody debris (LWD). This study investigated whether hyporheic improvement within 10 to 50 cm below streambed surface is evident around existing wood structures in a small New Zealand pasture stream in the Whatawhata area near Hamilton. Samples were taken around LWD and from areas where no wood was present in the pasture and from a control stream. At the pasture stream site, where the hyporheic zone was impacted by sedimentation and suffered from low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (on average 8.4, 4.3 and 2.4 mg L-1 at 10, 30 and 50 cm depth, respectively), LWD was not associated with a significant improvement in vertical hydrological exchange, hyporheic habitat quality or invertebrate richness. However, higher densities in hyporheic invertebrates were found where LWD was present (100 vs. 56 individuals per L of sediment), in particular Leptophlebiidae and Oligochaeta. Potential pumping effects of LWD may have been hampered by large-scale deep groundwater upwelling in this reach. We conclude that in pasture streams where sedimentation is a legacy of land clearance on unstable slopes and where low hyporheic DO concentrations prevail, wood addition may not be an effective rehabilitation tool.Show less"
