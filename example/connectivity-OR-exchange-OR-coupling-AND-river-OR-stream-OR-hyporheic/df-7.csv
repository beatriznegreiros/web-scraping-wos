By varying the depths and spatial locations of the clay lens, 24 scenarios and one blank control experiment were created. Dye tracers were applied to visualize patterns of hyporheic exchange and the extent of the hyporheic zone, while NaCl tracers were used to calculate hyporheic fluxes. The results revealed that the clay lens reduces hyporheic exchange and that the reduction depends on its spatial location. In general, the effect was stronger when the lens was in the center of the sand dune. The effect weakened when the lens was moved near the boundary of the sand dune. A change in horizontal location had a stronger influence on the extent of the hyporheic zone compared with a change in depth. The size of the hyporheic zone changed with the depth and position of the clay lens. There was a maximum of hyporheic extent with the lens at a depth of 0.1 m caused by changes of water flow paths.Show less"
1,"Hartwig, M",Mar 2012 ,Suspended sediments in the Kharaa River catchment (Mongolia) and its impact on hyporheic zone functions,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"A previous study investigating the ecological status of the Kharaa River in Northern Mongolia reported fine-grained sediments as being a major stress factor causing adverse impacts on the benthic ecology. However, the source of these sediments within the catchment as well as the specific impact on hyporheic zone functions in the Kharaa River remained unclear. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to investigate the underlying source-receptor system and implement an integrated monitoring approach. Suspended sediment sources within the Kharaa catchment were identified by using extensive spatially distributed sediment sampling and geochemical and isotope fingerprinting methods. On the receptor side, the ecological implications across a gradient of fine-grained sediment influx were analyzed using a distinct hyporheic zone monitoring scheme at three representative river reaches along the Kharaa River. Results of suspended sediment source monitoring show that during snowmelt runoff, riverbank and gully erosion were the dominant sources. During the summer period, upland erosion contributed a substantial share of suspended sediment. Fine-grained sediment influx proved to be the cause of habitat loss in the hyporheic zone and benthic oxygen production limitation. This combined catchment and in-stream monitoring approach will allow for a better understanding and spatially explicit analysis of the interactions of suspended sediment transport and hyporheic zone functioning. This information has built the basis for a coupled modeling framework that will help to develop efficient management measures within the Kharaa River basin with special emphasis on rapidly changing land-use and climatic conditions.Show less"
2,"Ryan, RJ",Nov 2006 ,Influence of streambed hydraulic conductivity on solute exchange with the hyporheic zone,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY,"A conservative solute tracer experiment was conducted in Indian Creek, a small urban stream in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to investigate the role of subsurface properties on the exchange between streamwater and the hyporheic zone (subsurface surrounding the stream). Sodium Bromide (NaBr) was used as a conservative tracer, and it was monitored in the surface water at two stations and in the upper bed sediments (shallow hyporheic zone extending from 7.5 to 10 cm below the streambed). The hydraulic conductivity (K) of the upper bed sediments and the lower bed sediments (10-12.5 cm below the streambed) was measured in situ. High tracer concentrations were observed in the upper layer at locations where the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer was larger than that of the lower layer. Low concentrations in the upper layer were observed in the converse case. A statistically significant relationship between the mass retained in the upper layer and the difference of K values between layers was observed.Show less"
3,"Danczak, RE",Dec 2016 ,Seasonal hyporheic dynamics control coupled microbiology and geochemistry in Colorado River sediments,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Riverbed microbial communities play an oversized role in many watershed ecosystem functions, including the processing of organic carbon, cycling of nitrogen, and alterations to metal mobility. The structure and activity of microbial assemblages depend in part on geochemical conditions set by river-groundwater exchange or hyporheic exchange. To assess how seasonal changes in river-groundwater mixing affect these populations in a snowmelt-dominated fluvial system, vertical sediment and pore water profiles were sampled at three time points at one location in the hyporheic zone of the Colorado River and analyzed by using geochemical measurements, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and ecological modeling. Oxic river water penetrated deepest into the subsurface during peak river discharge, while under base flow conditions, anoxic groundwater dominated shallower depths. Over a 70 cmthick interval, riverbed sediments were therefore exposed to seasonally fluctuating redox conditions and hosted microbial populations statistically different from those at both shallower and deeper locations. Additionally, microbial populations within this zone were shown to be the most dynamic across sampling time points, underlining the critical role that hyporheic mixing plays in constraining microbial abundances. Given such mixing effects, we anticipate that future changes in river discharge in mountainous, semiarid western U.S. watersheds may affect microbial community structure and function in riverbed environments, with potential implications for biogeochemical processes in riparian regions.Show less"
4,"Revelli, R",Dec 20 2008 ,Intra-meander hyporheic flow in alluvial rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Several geomorphological fluvial features are able to induce hyporheic exchange between the rivers and the alluvial sediments. However, while the small-scale exchange induced by bed forms has been thoroughly investigated, the role of the larger features remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the hyporheic flows driven by the channel sinuosity in the intrameander zone. A physically based model is adopted to simulate the morphodynamic evolution of three different meandering rivers, from the first stages of the meander evolution until the incipient meander cutoff. For each stage, the sinuosity-driven intrameander hyporheic flow is computed. In this way, the hyporheic flow field, the fluxes exchanged with the river, and the residence times are described during the whole meander evolution. The main result concerns the existence of a remarkable zonation induced by the flow field in the intrameander zone. The more the meander evolves, the more the zonation becomes pronounced, and the probability distribution of the residence times shows a bimodal shape with an intermediate power law behavior. Some general rules governing the typical timescales of the intrameander hyporheic flow and the mean exchanged flux are also deduced.Show less"
5,"Lotts, WS",Apr 2022 ,Pipe Dreams: The Effects of Stream Bank Soil Pipes on Hyporheic Denitrification Caused by a Peak Flow Event,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Peak flow events in gaining stream/river channels cause lung model hyporheic exchange with the banks (bank storage), which fosters beneficial reactions as polluted channel water cycles through riparian groundwater. Soil pipes are common along stream/riverbanks, and enhance exchange, yet their effect on reactions such as denitrification is unknown. We used MODFLOW with the Conduit Flow Package to simulate lung model exchange during a peak flow event in a section of stream bank/riparian soil with soil pipes, and MT3D-USGS to estimate nitrate transport and denitrification. We varied soil matrix hydraulic conductivity (K) and first-order reaction constant (k), as well as soil pipe density, length, and height above the initial channel water surface elevation (H). The addition of soil pipes enhanced stream bank (riparian) denitrification relative to banks without pipes, e.g., a 76% increase due to adding a single 1.5 m pipe. Denitrification increased linearly with pipe density but exhibited nonlinear trends with other parameters. Sensitivity analysis revealed length and density to be most influential. Soil pipe enhancement of denitrification was governed by hyporheic volume in most cases in our study. Exceptions included (a) coarse soil (K = 10(-3) m/s) and (b) low k and H > 0. Scaling our results to the stream corridor scale estimated that five soil pipes per m cumulatively induced 3% nitrate removal along a 1 km reach. Overall, soil pipes enhanced advection of nitrate into the banks, and also increased residence times of that nitrate under certain conditions, which together enhanced denitrification. This enhancement has implications for excess nitrate management in watersheds.Show less"
6,"Sawyer, AH",Jan 21 2012 ,Hyporheic temperature dynamics and heat exchange near channel-spanning logs,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The flow of river water around large woody debris (LWD) creates pressure gradients along the riverbed that drive river-groundwater mixing, or hyporheic exchange, and heat transport within the hyporheic zone. We quantify hyporheic fluid and heat exchange induced by current interaction with channel-spanning logs using two approaches: laboratory flume experiments and numerical simulations that link turbulent open-channel fluid flow, porous fluid flow, and heat transport. Flume and numerical experiments show that logs produce a characteristic diel temperature pattern within sediment that shifts with log blockage ratio (a fraction of the channel depth blocked by the log), channel Froude number, and sediment permeability. Upstream of a log, downwelling water transports the river's diel thermal signal deep into the sediment. Downstream, upwelling water from shallow flow paths has a thermal signal similar to the surface water, while upwelling water from deep flow paths forms a wedge of buffered (low-amplitude) temperatures. Since most hyporheic water emerges from shallow flow paths, upwelling water has limited potential to buffer surface water temperature. Because of historic channel clearing practices, modern rivers have unnaturally low densities of LWD. A key implication is that LWD removal has contributed to thermal homogenization and potential degradation of hyporheic habitats. LWD reintroduction is a promising strategy to improve vertical connectivity in rivers and increase thermal patchiness within the hyporheic zone. However, hyporheic exchange near LWD may not impact diel surface water temperatures at the reach scale.Show less"
7,"Olsen, DA",Aug 2003 ,"Hyporheic community composition in a gravel-bed stream: influence of vertical hydrological exchange, sediment structure and physicochemistry",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. We studied the relative contributions of the magnitude and direction of vertical hydrological exchange, subsurface sediment composition and interstitial physicochemistry in determining the distribution of hyporheic invertebrates in the Kye Burn, a fourth order gravel-bed stream in New Zealand.2. In winter 2000 and summer 2001, we measured vertical hydrological gradient (VHG), dissolved oxygen, water temperature and water chemistry using mini-piezometers, each installed in a different upwelling or downwelling zone. Next to every piezometer, a freeze core sample was taken to quantify the sediment, particulate organic matter and invertebrates.3. Dissolved oxygen concentration at 25 cm was high on both occasions (>9 mg L-1) but was higher in winter than summer. Interstitial water temperature was higher in down than upwellings and was substantially higher in summer than winter. Other features of the subsurface sediments and interstitial nitrate-nitrite concentrations were similar on both occasions and in up and downwellings. Interstitial ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorous concentrations were higher in winter than summer and ammonium was higher in up than downwelling areas.4. The proportion of fine sediment (63 mum(-1) mm), sediment heterogeneity and VHG accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in invertebrate distributions in both summer and winter.5. The hyporheos was numerically dominated by early instar leptophlebiid mayfly nymphs and asellotan isopods. Water mites were a taxonomically diverse group with 13 genera. Taxonomic diversity (Shannon-Weaver), but not taxon richness, was higher in upwelling areas, reflecting lower numerical dominance by a few taxa in these locations.6. Sediment composition (particularly the amount of fine sediments) and vertical hydrological exchange determined the composition and distribution of the hyporheos. Patchiness in these factors is important in planning sampling regimes or field manipulations in the hyporheic zone.Show less"
8,"Li, Y",Sep 1 2020 ,Grain size tunes microbial community assembly and nitrogen transformation activity under frequent hyporheic exchange: A column experiment,WATER RESEARCH,"Hyporheic zones (HZ) are hotspots for biogeochemical reactions where groundwater and surface water mix. River dam buildings and other hydrologic controls alter the sediment grain size distribution and modify the downstream hyporheic exchange, with cascading effects on geochemical and microbial processes in river corridors. In this lab-scale column experiment, the N transformations in HZ filled with sediments in different grain sizes were investigated with a focus on understanding the interplay among variational hydraulic connectivity, microbial community structure, functional potential under frequent groundwater-surface water exchange. Porosity was identified as the main driver determining bacterial community assembly in HZ sediments. Significant microbial zonation was observed along the columns and the degree of co-occurrence of bacterial communities in the Fine column was lower than that in the Coarse and Mix columns. The Coarse column allowed for almost 2.47 times the exchange flux relative to the Fine column, and generates the fastest DO consumption rate (-6.52 mu g O-2/L.s). The enrichment of nitriflers, i.e., Cytophagaceae and Bacillaceae and nitrification functional genes, i.e., amoA_AOA and amoA_AOB revealed the higher nitrification potential in column filled with coarse sediments. In com- parison, the highest NH4+ production rates (2.4 x 10(-3) mu g N/L.s) took place in Fine column. The higher abundancies of denitriflers such as Comamonadaceae and Lysobacter and enrichment of functional genes of nirK and nirS interestingly suggested the elevated denitrification potential in Fine column in a more anaerobic environment. The results implied that variations in microbial functional potential and associated nitrogen transformation may occur in size-fractioned HZ to dynamic hyporheic exchange, which added new knowledge to the underlying biogeochemical and ecological processes in regulated river corridors.

9,"Lewandowski, J",Nov 2019 ,Is the Hyporheic Zone Relevant beyond the Scientific Community?,WATER,"Rivers are important ecosystems under continuous anthropogenic stresses. The hyporheic zone is a ubiquitous, reactive interface between the main channel and its surrounding sediments along the river network. We elaborate on the main physical, biological, and biogeochemical drivers and processes within the hyporheic zone that have been studied by multiple scientific disciplines for almost half a century. These previous efforts have shown that the hyporheic zone is a modulator for most metabolic stream processes and serves as a refuge and habitat for a diverse range of aquatic organisms. It also exerts a major control on river water quality by increasing the contact time with reactive environments, which in turn results in retention and transformation of nutrients, trace organic compounds, fine suspended particles, and microplastics, among others. The paper showcases the critical importance of hyporheic zones, both from a scientific and an applied perspective, and their role in ecosystem services to answer the question of the manuscript title. It identifies major research gaps in our understanding of hyporheic processes. In conclusion, we highlight the potential of hyporheic restoration to efficiently manage and reactivate ecosystem functions and services in river corridors.Show less"
10,"Taleb, A",Feb 2008 ,"The role of the hyporheic zone in the nitrogen dynamics of a semi-arid gravel bed stream located downstream of a heavily polluted reservoir (Tafna Wadi, Algeria)",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Nitrogen retention was measured along the Tafna wadi downstream of a heavily polluted reservoir in North-West Algeria to understand the role of the hyporheic zone (HZ) in nitrogen dynamics. Nutrient concentrations were measured monthly for 2 years within the bed sediments of a 300m reach located 20km downstream from the dam. Due to strong hydrological fluctuations hyporheic water was analysed during natural low and high water (HW) periods, and during water reservoir releases. Nutrient concentrations in surface water (SW) increased during water releases and in the HZ during the low water (LW) periods. Surface/hyporheic water interactions were characterized by determining the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and the chemical signature of the ground water (GW). The latter was obtained from regional GW monitoring. Hyporheic chemistry was strongly influenced by patterns of surface flow. Hyporheic and SWs had similar chloride concentrations during high flow when they were significantly lower than those of the regional GW. GW was generally richer in nitrates and nitrites, but was lower in ammonium concentrations than interstitial and river waters. Nitrates decreased significantly from upstream to downstream within the HZ throughout the hydrological period even though temporal fluctuations were high. Ammonium concentrations in interstitial water (IW) were significantly higher than in SW and generally increased from upstream to downstream. This study demonstrates the importance of the HZ in altering the dissolved inorganic nitrogen composition and concentrations of heavily polluted arid streams. The study is of interest because it documents a large 'natural experiment' that being the effect of periodic water release from a reservoir with serious water quality problems on the water quality dynamics (particularly nitrogen) of subsurface and SWs downstream.

11,"Gao, YQ",Dec 2020 ,Change of stream network connectivity and its impact on flood control,WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,"Urbanization can alter the hydrogeomorphology of streams and rivers, change stream network structures, and reduce stream network connectivity, which leads to a decrease in the storage capacity of stream networks and aggravates flood damage. Therefore, investigation of the ways in which stream network connectivity impacts flood storage capacity and flood control in urbanized watersheds can provide significant benefits. This study developed a framework to assess stream network connectivity and its impact on flood control. First, a few connectivity indices were adopted to assess longitudinal stream network connectivity. Afterward, the static and dynamic storage capacities of stream networks were evaluated using storage capacity indices and a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Finally, the impact of stream network connectivity change on flood control was assessed by investigating the changes in stream network connectivity and storage capacity. This framework was applied to the Qinhuai River Basin, China, where intensive urbanization has occurred in the last few decades. The results show that stream network storage capacity is affected by stream network connectivity. Increasing stream network connectivity enhances stream network storage capacity.

12,"Chow, R",Jan 2020 ,Evaluating Subsurface Parameterization to Simulate Hyporheic Exchange: The Steinlach River Test Site,GROUNDWATER,"Hyporheic exchange is the interaction of river water and groundwater, and is difficult to predict. One of the largest contributions to predictive uncertainty for hyporheic exchange has been attributed to the representation of heterogeneous subsurface properties. Our study evaluates the trade-offs between intrinsic (irreducible) and epistemic (reducible) model errors when choosing between homogeneous and highly complex subsurface parameter structures. We modeled the Steinlach River Test Site in Southwest Germany using a fully coupled surface water-groundwater model to simulate hyporheic exchange and to assess the predictive errors and uncertainties of transit time distributions. A highly parameterized model was built, treated as a ""virtual reality"" and used as a reference. We found that if the parameter structure is too simple, it will be limited by intrinsic model errors. By increasing subsurface complexity through the addition of zones or heterogeneity, we can begin to exchange intrinsic for epistemic errors. Thus, the appropriate level of detail to represent the subsurface depends on the acceptable range of intrinsic structural errors for the given modeling objectives and the available site data. We found that a zonated model is capable of reproducing the transit time distributions of a more detailed model, but only if the geological structures are known. An interpolated heterogeneous parameter field (cf. pilot points) showed the best trade-offs between the two errors, indicating fitness for practical applications. Parameter fields generated by multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) produce transit time distributions with the largest uncertainties, however, these are reducible by additional hydrogeological data, particularly flux measurements.Show less"
13,"Kruegler, J",Feb 2020 ,Dynamic Evapotranspiration Alters Hyporheic Flow and Residence Times in the Intrameander Zone,WATER,"Hyporheic zones (HZs) influence biogeochemistry at the local reach scale with potential implication for water quality at the large catchment scale. The characteristics of the HZs (e.g., area, flux rates, and residence times) change in response to channel and aquifer physical properties, as well as to transient perturbations in the stream-aquifer system such as floods and groundwater withdraws due to evapotranspiration (ET) and pumping. In this study, we use a numerical model to evaluate the effects of transient near-stream evapotranspiration (ET) on the area, exchange flux, and residence time (RT) of sinuosity-induced HZs modulated by regional groundwater flow (RGF). We found that the ET fluxes (up to 80 mm/day) consistently increased HZ area and exchange flux, and only increased RTs when the intensity of regional groundwater flow was low. Relative to simulations without ET, scenarios with active ET had more than double HZ area and exchange flux and about 20% longer residence times (as measured by the median of the residence time distribution). Our model simulations show that the drawdown induced by riparian ET increases the net flux of water from the stream to the nearby aquifer, consistent with field observations. The results also suggest that, along with ET intensity, the magnitude of the HZ response is influenced by the modulating effect of both gaining and losing RGF and the sensitivity of the aquifer to daily cycles of ET withdrawal. This work highlights the importance of representing near-stream ET when modeling sinuosity-induced hyporheic zones, as well as the importance of including riparian vegetation in efforts to restore the ecosystem functions of streams.Show less"

15,"Folegot, S",Feb 2018 ,Mesocosm experiments reveal the direction of groundwater-surface water exchange alters the hyporheic refuge capacity under warming scenarios,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Climate change is expected to affect hydrologic and thermal regimes of river ecosystems. During dry periods when river flows decrease and water temperatures increase, the hyporheic zone (HZ) can provide a refuge to surface aquatic invertebrates and enhance the resilience capacity of riverine ecosystems. However, shifts from up- to downwelling flow conditions in the HZ could jeopardise this capacity. Using laboratory mesocosms and high-resolution fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing, we explored the combined effects of five different increased surface water temperature treatments (from 15 to 27 degrees C at 3 degrees C intervals) and the direction of water exchange on the ability of Gammarus pulex (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Gammaridae) to migrate into the HZ as a response to warming. We determined the survival rates of this ubiquitous hyporheic dweller and its rates of consumption of alder (Alnus glutinosa; Betulaceae) leaf litter in the HZ. Results showed that at increasing surface water temperature, leaf-litter breakdown was observed at a greater depth in the sediments under downwelling flow conditions, that is, G.pulex migrated deeper into the HZ compared with upwelling conditions, resulting in greater survival rates (6411 vs. 44 +/- 10%). However, under both upwelling and downwelling conditions, we found evidence for potential use of the hyporheic zone as a thermal refuge for G.pulex. Below sediment depths of 25cm, temperatures remained low (<22 degrees C) even when surface waters were at 27 degrees C, so temperatures deep in the hyporheic zone never exceeded critical thermal thresholds for G.pulex. This study provides evidence that alterations to the direction of groundwater-surface water exchange can alter the capacity of the HZ to provide a refuge for benthic invertebrates, thereby affecting the resilience of river communities to warming under climate change.Show less"
16,"Cadbury, SL",Jan 2008 ,Stream temperature dynamics within a New Zealand glacierized river basin,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Knowledge of river thermal dynamics for glacierized basins is limited, despite the high sensitivity of these systems to climatic change/variability. This study examined spatio-temporal water column and streambed temperature dynamics within a New Zealand glacierized river basin over two melt seasons. Water column temperature was recorded at three sites along the mainstem channel and four hill slope/groundwater-fed tributaries. Air temperature, precipitation and stream discharge were monitored to characterize hydroclimatological conditions. Streambed temperature was monitored at the upper and lower main river sites at 0.05, 0.2 and 0.4 m depth. Water column temperature rose on average 0.6 degrees C km(-1) along the glacier-fed mainstem. Temperature was elevated during warmer periods but the downstream increase was reduced clue to greater meltwater production (consequently a larger total stream flow volume for atmospheric heating) plus a proportional reduction in warmer groundwater contributions. Hillslope/groundwater-fed tributaries yielded a range of temperature patterns, indicating variable sourcing (meltwater or rainfall) and residence times. In the upper basin, streambed temperature was warmer than the water column, suggesting groundwater upwelling; however, during high runoff events, water column and streambed temperature converged, indicating downwelling/heat advection by channel water. At the lower site, streambed temperature mirrored the water column, suggesting greater surface water/atmospheric influences. Key drivers of stream thermal regime were: (1) relative water source contributions, (2) prevailing hydroclimatological conditions, (3) distance from source, (4) total stream flow volume and (5) basin factors (specifically, valley/channel geomorphology and riparian forest). High magnitude precipitation events produced a contrasting stream thermal response to that reported elsewhere. In contrast to European alpine research, streams showed a reduced thermal range owing to the relatively mild, wet melt season climate. This New Zealand case study highlights the importance of understanding basin-specific modification of energy and hydrological fluxes for accurate prediction of stream thermal dynamics/habitat and ecological response to climatic variability and change.

17,"Stubbington, R",Jul 2011 ,Benthic and hyporheic invertebrate community responses to seasonal flow recession in a groundwater-dominated stream,ECOHYDROLOGY,"Natural hydrological variability in lotic ecosystems can include prolonged periods of flow recession. A reduction in discharge is accompanied by abiotic changes in benthic and hyporheic habitats, often including reductions in habitat availability. Whilst the benthic invertebrate community response to low flows is well documented, little research has considered how the composition of the community within the hyporheic zone is affected. We examined benthic and hyporheic invertebrate community composition during flow recession in a temperate karst stream, at sites with contrasting historic flow permanence regimes. Changes in benthic invertebrate community composition primarily reflected changes in habitat availability associated with discharge variability; in particular, the population density of the dominant amphipod, Gammarus pulex, increased as the area of submerged benthic sediments declined. Concurrent significant increases in the hyporheic abundance of G. pulex, and moderate increase in the proportion of the total G. pulex population inhabiting the hyporheic zone were recorded. It is postulated that G. pulex migrated into the hyporheic zone to reduce exposure to intensifying biological interactions in the benthic sediments. An increase in the hyporheic abundance of G. pulex was particularly pronounced at sites with historic intermittent flow, which could be attributed to downwelling stream water dominating vertical hydrologic exchange. The increase in G. pulex abundance reduced community diversity in the benthic sediments, but had no apparent detrimental effects on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages.

We used a stratified random design to sample riffles with contrasting groundwater-surface water exchange regimes, but with similar bedform, current velocity, and substrata grain size. We examined general patterns of exchange between river channel and hyporheic zone waters by measuring vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) and hydraulic conductivities using mini-piezometers. Riffles near the upstream limit of each flood plain were characterized by strong, hyporheic recharge (-VHG, down-welling), whereas riffles throughout the lower half of each flood plain were characterized by weak, dispersed hyporheic discharge (+VHG, upwelling). There were no differences in mean seston concentrations between riffles on either flood plain within any season. Although mean algal biomass was not significantly different across seasons, maximum biomass was generally higher in upwelling zone riffles (+VHG) than in downwelling zone riffles (-VHG). Variation in algal standing crop in upwelling riffles was similar to30% greater than in downwelling riffles. There was no difference in mean EPT density between upwelling and downwelling sites. However, there were species-specific responses to differential hyporheic exchange, which were correlated with differences in algal biomass and VHG. The results of our study suggest that hyporheic exchange patterns influence physical habitat structure of main-channel riffles, and affect the distribution and abundance of algae and EPT macroinvertebrates in these habitats.Show less"
19,"JONES, JB",Apr 1995 ,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE AND ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM IN A SONORAN DESERT STREAM,ECOLOGY,"Hyporheic metabolism in a Sonoran Desert stream was examined, focusing on the sources of detritus supporting hyporheic respiration. Two alternative hypotheses were specifically addressed: (1) organic matter derived from the surface stream supports hyporheic respiration, and (2) detritus buried during flash floods supports hyporheic respiration. As predicted for the surface-derived organic matter hypothesis, respiration was lowest immediately following flash floods and increased significantly with time after flood (P < 0.001). Hyporheic respiration ranged from 0.05 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) immediately following a flash flood to as high as 4.41 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) late in algal succession. Respiration was significantly correlated with surface algal biomass during two spring/summer successional sequences (P < 0.05; partial correlation coefficients 0.58 and 0.88). Respiration was also consistently higher in downwelling than upwelling zones with overall mean rates of 1.12 and 0.46 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1), respectively. Respiration exhibited a distinct diel pattern with highest rate coinciding with time of maximum photosynthesis and was also significantly correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentration (P < 0.05), further supporting the hypothesis of hyporheic dependence on algal production. Flash floods bury organic matter that is also respired in the hyporheic zone; however, based upon storage of organic carbon immediately following floods, an average of only 15% of the observed respiration could be supported. We conclude that hyporheic respiration in Sycamore Creek is tightly linked to surface production. It is spatially distributed in biotic ''hot spots'' where surface waters enter hyporheic sediments and is most likely supported by organic matter that is supplied as dissolved organic carbon, perhaps from algal production.Show less"

At both banks the stream hyporheic zone lost water to the riparian groundwater zone. Independently, the hydraulic heads at three sites in the streambed and in the riparian zone exhibited periodic, diurnal fluctuations. We attributed them to water consumption by the riparian trees, as solar radiation explained part of this additional variation.Our results demonstrate that subsurface water exchanges take place between the hyporheic zone and lateral riparian groundwater in spatially defined small-scale flow paths. These small-scale interactions occur within the context of large-scale patterns of loss and gain of channel water.Show less"

Hyporheic macroinvertebrates were sampled using a series of PVC wells driven into parafluvial bars in the three stream types. Benthic invertebrates were collected using Hess samples from the stream channel adjacent to parafluvial well locations to compare surface macroinvertebrate communities to that of the hyporheic communities. Temperature, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and total nitrogen concentrations were significantly higher in the brownwater stream compared to the other stream types. Hyporheic macroinvertebrate density was 88% higher in the brownwater stream, despite significantly lower dissolved oxygen concentrations, Benthic macroinvertebrate density was 95% greater in the brownwater stream type than the benthos of the two other stream types. Benthic and hyporheic samples were collector-gatherer driven and the hyporheic zone was functionally more diverse than the benthic habitat with a similar taxa composition across all habitats and stream types. The study of aquatic ecosystems is especially important in Southeast Alaska, where the temperate rainforests are still relatively un-disturbed, and most watersheds still have healthy salmon runs. Our study provides useful data for future management and research in this unique ecoregion, which is predicted to experience substantial climatic changes in temperature and precipitation patterns in the future.Show less"
22,"Shibata, H",May 2004 ,"Nitrogen dynamics in the hyporheic zone of a forested stream during a small storm, Hokkaido, Japan",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Water and dissolved nitrogen flows through the hyporheic zone of a 3rd-order mountain stream in Hokkaido, northern Japan were measured during a small storm in August 1997. A network of wells was established to measure water table elevations and to collect water samples to analyze dissolved nitrogen concentrations. Hydraulic conductivity and the depth to bedrock were surveyed. We parameterized the groundwater flow model, MODFLOW, to quantify subsurface flows of both stream water and soil water through the hyporheic zone. MODFLOW simulations suggest that soil water inflow from the adjacent hill slope increased by 1.7-fold during a small storm. Dissolved organic nitrogen ( DON) and ammonium NH4+ in soil water from the hill slope were the dominant nitrogen inputs to the riparian zone. DON was consumed via mineralization to NH4+ in the hyporheic zone. NH4+ was the dominant nitrogen species in the subsurface, and showed a net release during both base and storm flow. Nitrate appeared to be lost to denitrification or immobilized by microorganisms and/or vegetation in the riparian zone. Our results indicated that the riparian and hyporheic system was a net source of NH4+ to the stream.Show less"

Hyporheic physico-chemistry and invertebrates were compared among small streams draining hill-country catchments under pasture, exotic pine forest, and native forest near Hamilton, New Zealand. In streams draining native forest, the hyporheic zone harboured a relatively diverse invertebrate fauna comprising mostly taxa common in the surface benthos, although a few apparently obligate hyporheic taxa (ostracods, blind amphipods) were collected. Few individuals and taxa occupied the hyporheic zones of streams draining pasture with some groups such as water mites conspicuously absent. The hyporheos of the stream in exotic pine forest was similar in richness and abundance to that of the pasture streams. Hyporheic water temperatures were significantly higher in the pasture streams than those in pine or native forest. There were strong positive correlations between percentage saturation of dissolved oxygen in the hyporheic zones of all streams and both species richness and total invertebrate abundance. We suggest that land clearance for pasture leads to hill slumping and siltation that bury the lateral bars along the stream channels, rendering this habitat unsuitable for hyporheic invertebrates. Channel narrowing and incision may physically remove further hyporheic habitat, and the reduction of flushing flows to remove interstitial silt and clay leads to low hyporheic dissolved oxygen concentrations and reduced colonisation by surface benthos.Show less"
25,"Garbin, S",Feb 2019 ,Hydrological controls on river network connectivity,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,"This study proposes a probabilistic approach for the quantitative assessment of reach-and network-scale hydrological connectivity as dictated by river flow space-time variability. Spatial dynamics of daily streamflows are estimated based on climatic and morphological features of the contributing catchment, integrating a physically based approach that accounts for the stochasticity of rainfall with a water balance framework and a geomorphic recession flow analysis. Ecologically meaningful minimum stage thresholds are used to evaluate the connectivity of individual stream reaches, and other relevant network-scale connectivity metrics. The framework allows a quantitative description of the main hydrological causes and the ecological consequences of water depth dynamics experienced by river networks. The analysis shows that the spatial variability of local-scale hydrological connectivity is strongly affected by the spatial and temporal distribution of climatic variables. Depending on the underlying climatic settings and the critical stage threshold, loss of connectivity can be observed in the headwaters or along the main channel, thereby originating a fragmented river network. The proposed approach provides important clues for understanding the effect of climate on the ecological function of river corridors.Show less"
26,"Kasahara, T",2009 ,Treating causes not symptoms: restoration of surface-groundwater interactions in rivers,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"Many river restoration projects seek to address issues associated with impaired hydrological and ecological connectivity in longitudinal (e. g. effects of dams, weirs) or lateral (e. g. alienated floodplain) dimensions. Efforts to restore the vertical dimension of impaired stream-groundwater exchange are rare, hampered by limited understanding of the factors controlling this linkage in natural alluvial rivers. We propose a simplified two-axis model of the 'primary drivers' (sediment structure and vertical hydraulic gradient) of stream-groundwater exchange that acknowledges their interaction and provides a practical template to help researchers and river managers pose hypothesis-driven solutions to restoration of damaged or lost vertical connectivity. Many human activities impact on one or both of these drivers, and we review some of the tools available for treating the causes (rather than symptoms) in impacted stream reaches. For example, creating riffle-pool sequences along stream reaches will enhance vertical hydraulic gradient, whereas flushing flows can remove clogging layers and sustain sediment permeability. Our model is a first step to specifying mechanisms for recovery of lost vertical connectivity. Assessing results of river restoration using this approach at reach to catchment scales will provide scientific insights into the interplay of hydrology, fluvial geomorphology and river ecosystem function at appropriately broad scales.Show less"
27,"Corson-Rikert, HA",Oct 2016 ,"Carbon dynamics in the hyporheic zone of a headwater mountain stream in the Cascade Mountains, Oregon",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We investigated carbon dynamics in the hyporheic zone of a steep, forested, headwater catchment western Oregon, USA. Water samples were collected monthly from the stream and a well network during base flow periods. We examined the potential for mixing of different source waters to explain concentrations of DOC and DIC. We did not find convincing evidence that either inputs of deep groundwater or lateral inputs of shallow soil water influenced carbon dynamics. Rather, carbon dynamics appeared to be controlled by local processes in the hyporheic zone and overlying riparian soils. DOC concentrations were low in stream water (0.04-0.09 mM), and decreased with nominal travel time through the hyporheic zone (0.02-0.04 mM lost over 100 h). Conversely, stream water DIC concentrations were much greater than DOC (0.35-0.7 mM) and increased with nominal travel time through the hyporheic zone (0.2-0.4 mM gained over 100 h). DOC in stream water could only account for 10% of the observed increase in DIC. In situ metabolic processing of buried particulate organic matter as well as advection of CO2 from the vadose zone likely accounted for the remaining 90% of the increase in DIC. Overall, the hyporheic zone was a source of DIC to the stream. We suggest that, in mountain stream networks, hyporheic exchange facilitates the transformation of particulate organic carbon buried in floodplains and transports the DIC that is produced back to the stream where it can be evaded to the atmosphere.Show less"
28,"Jin, GQ",Mar 15 2019 ,Colloid transport and distribution in the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Colloids moving from the stream into the hyporheic zone may have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems as they are potential contaminants or carriers of contaminants. Moreover, retained colloids in the hyporheic zone could not only reduce the exchange flux between the stream and streambed but also change the conditions of the bed, affecting the habitats for aquatic organisms. Previous studies focused on the exchange flux across the sediment-water interface, but the colloid transport processes and distribution of retained colloids in the streambed have received little attention. We conducted experiments within a laboratory flume to examine these processes in a streambed driven by bedform-induced hyporheic flow. Retained colloids measured in the bed at the end of the experiments revealed colloid retention mainly in the shallow layer of hyporheic zone (0-5 cm below the interface). The results demonstrated significant effects of particle trapping and settling on the colloid transport and distribution in the streambed. Retention leads to the formation of a colloid-filled shallow layer in the bed. Particle paths based on model simulations showed that colloid settling in pore water modifies the direction of colloid transport and allows the colloid particles to move more deeply in the bed.Show less"
29,"Soulsby, C",Dec 2009 ,SEASONAL AND INTER-ANNUAL VARIABILITY IN HYPORHEIC WATER QUALITY REVEALED BY CONTINUOUS MONITORING IN A SALMON SPAWNING STREAM,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Over a 3.5 year period, levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation were continuously monitored in surface waters and at depths of 150 and 300 mm in the hyporheic zone of a riffle in a montane stream where Atlantic salmon spawn. Throughout this period, DO in surface waters remained close to 100% saturation, but exhibited daily variations related to CO(2) cycling driven by diurnal patterns of respiration and photosynthesis. However, in the hyporheic zone, variations were much more dynamic over storm event, seasonal and inter-annual timescales. At 300 mm, DO saturation was generally close to 100% during summer low flows, though levels occasionally fell during warm periods which appeared to be related to diffusion gradients caused by benthic respiration. Such DO decreases at low flows were much more common and marked at 150 mm. During wetter conditions, DO saturation at 300 mm fell to zero for prolonged periods; this is consistent with increased fluxes of groundwater discharging through the hyporheic zone. During the wettest periods this also affects DO saturation at 150 mm. However, during hydrological events, hyporheic water quality is 're-set' as head reversals cause streamwater ingress which results in transient periods of re-oxygenation, which end during the hydrograph recession. This is consistent with stream-ward hydraulic gradients being re-established in riparian ground water as the stream stage falls. The connectivity between groundwater and streamwater through the hyporheic zone is driven by climatic conditions and is reflected in marked inter-annual variability in water quality characteristics. In some cases, this variability may have implications for the ecology of the hyporheic environment-including the survival of salmon eggs-particularly if oxygen levels are affected.

30,"Kaufman, MH",Aug 2017 ,Hyporheic hot moments: Dissolved oxygen dynamics in the hyporheic zone in response to surface flow perturbations,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a key environmental variable that drives and feeds back with numerous processes. In the aquatic sediment that makes up the hyporheic zone, DO may exhibit pronounced spatial gradients and complex patterns which control the distribution of a series of redox processes. Yet, little is known regarding the dynamics of hyporheic zone DO, especially under transitional flow regimes. Considering the natural tendency of rivers to be highly responsive to external forcing, these temporal dynamics are potentially just as important and pronounced as the spatial gradients. Here we use laboratory flume experiments and multiphysics flow and reactive transport modeling to investigate surface flow controls on the depth of oxygen penetration in the bed as well as the area of oxygenated sediment. We show that the hyporheic zone DO conditions respond over time scales of hours-to-days when subjected to practically instantaneous surface flow perturbations. Additionally, the flume experiments demonstrate that hyporheic zone DO conditions respond faster to surface flow acceleration than to deceleration. Finally, we found that the morphology of the dissolved oxygen plume front depends on surface flow acceleration or deceleration. This study thus shows that the highly dynamic nature of typical streams and rivers drives equally dynamic redox conditions in the hyporheic zone. Because the redox conditions and their distribution within the hyporheic zone are important from biological, ecological, and contaminant perspectives, this hyporheic redox dynamism has the potential to impact system scale aquatic chemical cycles.Show less"
31,"Liu, DS",Jun 2018 ,Dynamic processes of hyporheic exchange and temperature distribution in the riparian zone in response to dam-induced water fluctuations,GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL,"We examined the dynamic processes of hyporheic exchange and temperature distribution in a riparian zone in response to low-temperature water fluctuations downstream of the Xin'an River Dam, China, using analytical and mainly hydrodynamic methods. For this purpose, we installed six HM21 piezometers (R, P1-P5) between the river water and the groundwater at an interval of approximately 2 m perpendicular to the flow path. We also installed 20 PT100 thermistors (T1-T20) along the transect at depths of 1.19 m to 3.58 m and monitored the temperatures of river and air. Water levels and temperatures were automatically logged every 5 min by the real-time system from November to December 2014 and sent to the remote platform through the remote terminal unit. Results revealed that the intensity and direction of the hyporheic exchange (Q) between the river water and the groundwater varied periodically (t = 1 d) with the water level of the river. In each cycle, the Q was in a counterclockwise loop curve with the water level of the river and with the non-uniform distribution along the transect perpendicular to the river, which showed that the farther the lateral exchange was away from the river, the lower its intensity and the more hysteretic the alteration of its direction. The daily exchange width and residence time had no necessary connection with the average river stage, but mainly depended on the amplitude of the fluctuating river stage and the duration of river infiltration and established a strong linear relationship with their product. The temperature distribution of the riparian aquifer was mainly affected by the surface radiation and river water infiltration. It was characterized as ""cool on the surface and warm at the bottom"" in the vertical direction and could be divided into low-, medium-, and high-temperature zones along the horizontal direction. The horizontal infiltration distance (L) increased by power functions with the increase in infiltration rate (v) and decrease in river temperature (T).Show less"

33,"Freeman, MC",Feb 2007 ,Hydrologic connectivity and the contribution of stream headwaters to ecological integrity at regional scales,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Cumulatively, headwater streams contribute to maintaining hydrologic connectivity and ecosystem integrity at regional scales. Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Headwater streams compose over two-thirds of total stream length in a typical river drainage and directly connect the upland and riparian landscape to the rest of the stream ecosystem. Altering headwater streams, e.g., by channelization, diversion through pipes, impoundment and burial, modifies fluxes between uplands and downstream river segments and eliminates distinctive habitats. The large-scale ecological effects of altering headwaters are amplified by land uses that alter runoff and nutrient loads to streams, and by widespread dam construction on larger rivers (which frequently leaves free-flowing upstream portions of river systems essential to sustaining aquatic biodiversity). We discuss three examples of large-scale consequences of cumulative headwater alteration. Downstream eutrophication and coastal hypoxia result, in part, from agricultural practices that alter headwaters and wetlands while increasing nutrient runoff. Extensive headwater alteration is also expected to lower secondary productivity of river systems by reducing stream-system length and trophic subsidies to downstream river segments, affecting aquatic communities and terrestrial wildlife that utilize aquatic resources. Reduced viability of freshwater biota may occur with cumulative headwater alteration, including for species that occupy a range of stream sizes but for which headwater streams diversify the network of interconnected populations or enhance survival for particular life stages. Developing a more predictive understanding of ecological patterns that may emerge on regional scales as a result of headwater alterations will require studies focused on components and pathways that connect headwaters to river, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Linkages between headwaters and downstream ecosystems cannot be discounted when addressing large-scale issues such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and global losses of biodiversity.Show less"
34,"Capderrey, C",Dec 2013 ,Invertebrate distribution across nested geomorphic features in braided-river landscapes,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"River landscapes are increasingly viewed as a collection of nested geomorphic features, the hydrological effects of which juxtapose to create a mosaic of aquatic habitat conditions. We examined how the combined hydrological influences of stream reaches and gravel bars affect the composition of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages along the longitudinal and vertical dimensions of river landscapes. We worked in 12 braided-river valley segments of tributaries to the Rhone River, France. Valley segments were bounded downstream by geological knickpoints so that bedform-induced exchange flows beneath gravel bars and riffles were predictably embedded in exchange flows occurring at the valley-segment scale. In upstream reaches (UR) and downstream reaches (DR) of each valley segment, we collected invertebrates at the heads and tails of gravel bars in the hyporheic zone and at the upstream and downstream ends of riffles in surface channels adjacent to the bars. Patterns of vertical hydraulic gradient and specific conductance and the resulting spatial heterogeneity of temperature, dissolved O-2, and particulate organic C suggested that DR were points of flow convergence and water mixing. Specific conductance increased and temperature decreased more steeply along gravel bars in DR, indicating that water from long hyporheic flow paths or lateral aquifers was discharging at the tails of bars in DR. Density hotspots for insect larvae corresponded to hyporheic patches at the heads of bars in DR, which received the highest organic matter inputs from localized downwelling of surface water and were not affected by inputs of cold water from hyporheic flow paths or lateral aquifers. Density of epigean taxa at the tails of bars decreased more steeply with depth in DR than in UR, and density of hypogean taxa increased more steeply. Viewing local hyporheic assemblages as the outcome of a series of environmental filters operating over multiple exchange flows induced by nested geomorphic features provides a general framework that may foster our understanding of biodiversity patterns in river landscapes.Show less"

Although hyporheic invertebrates contribute little biomass and respiration relative to microbes in stream sediments, invertebrate effects on biogeochemical processes may be disproportionately large. We tested how various interstitial invertebrate assemblages affected N cycling and respiration in flow-through microcosms filled with alluvial sediment in the laboratory. Average invertebrate biomasses in low and high invertebrate treatments were 0.20 and 19 mg dry mass/L sediment, respectively. Average net NO3- regeneration/uptake rate increased with increasing invertebrate biomass, showing invertebrates suppressed NO3- uptake or stimulated in situ NO3- production. Average respiration (normalized for sediment organic matter) and particulate organic matter (POM) increased 51.9% and 33%, respectively, with increasing invertebrate biomass, suggesting direct contribution to hyporheic metabolism and/or stimulation of microbial activity and an accumulation of POM driven by invertebrates. We suggest that interstitial invertebrates can substantially alter biogeochemical processes in hyporheic zones.Show less"
37,"Shrivastava, S",Dec 2020 ,Distribution of clay-sized sediments in streambeds and influence of fine sediment clogging on hyporheic exchange,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In this work, the deposition of clay-sized fine particles (d(50) = 0.006 mm) and its subsequent influence on the dune-induced hyporheic exchange are investigated. Fine sand (D-50 = 0.28 mm), coarse sand (D-50 = 1.7 mm), and gravel (D-50 = 5.5 mm) grains were used to form homogenous model streambeds; one control - no clay input, and two treatments - increasing clay inputs for each grain type. The results indicate that the clogging profiles of clay-sized sediments may not be predicted accurately using the previously proposed metric based on the relative sizes of infiltrating and substrate sediments. Further, the depositional patterns vary with the initial concentration of clay particles in the surface water. The assessment of clogging profiles in coarse-grained model streambeds also reveals a preferential infiltration of the clay particles in the hyporheic downwelling regions. The results from the dye tracer test suggest that the accumulation of clay particles altered the exchange characteristics in the treatment flumes. For each grain size, the treatment flumes exhibit lower hyporheic flux and higher median residence times compared to their respective control flumes. The dye penetration depths were lower in treatment flumes with fine and coarse sand compared to their respective control flumes. Interestingly, higher penetration depths were observed in treatment flumes with gravel compared to their respective control flume potentially due to the generation of preferential flow paths in the partially clogged gravel beds. The clogging altered the hyporheic fluxes and residence times in the coarse-grained model beds to a greater degree in comparison to the fine sand beds. Overall, our findings indicate that the properties of both fine and substrate sediments influence the clogging patterns in streambeds, and the subsequent influence of fine sediment clogging on hyporheic exchange and associated processes may vary across stream ecosystems.Show less"
38,"Menichino, GT",Jun 2014 ,Hydraulic and thermal effects of in-stream structure-induced hyporheic exchange across a range of hydraulic conductivities,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In-stream structure-induced hyporheic exchange and associated thermal dynamics affect stream ecosystems. Their importance is controlled by spatial variability of sediment hydraulic conductivity (K). We calibrated a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of surface and groundwater hydraulics near a channel-spanning weir (represents log dams, boulder weirs) to field data and varied K from 10(-7) to 10(-2) m/s (silt to gravel). Surface water stopped cresting the weir for K>10(-3) m/s. Non-Darcy hyporheic flow was also prevalent for K > 10(-3) m/s, and velocity errors using non-CFD models ranged up to 32.2%. We also modeled weir-induced heat transport during summer. As K increased from 10(-7) to 10(-3) m/s, weir-induced hyporheic heat advection steadily increased. Cooling and buffering along hyporheic flow paths decreased with increasing K, particularly above K=10(-5) and 10(-4) m/s, respectively. Vertical heat conduction between surface water and groundwater near the weir decreased with increasing K, particularly for K>10(-5) m/s. Conduction between hyporheic flow paths and adjacent groundwater helped cool hyporheic flow. Downstream surface water cooling by hyporheic advection increased steadily with K as increases in hyporheic flow overwhelmed decreases in cooling along hyporheic flow paths. Yet such effects were small (0.016 degrees C) even at K=10(-3) m/s. The largest thermal effect of weir-induced exchange was therefore spatial expansion of subsurface diel variability (particularly for K>10(-5) m/s) which affects benthic habitat and chemical reactions. The specific values of K where such trend shifts occur is likely variable among streams based on flow conditions, but we expect the presence of such trend shifts to be widespread.Show less"
39,"Buxton, TH",Aug 2015 ,Modeling the influence of salmon spawning on hyporheic exchange of marine-derived nutrients in gravel stream beds,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Salmon that spawn in streams deliver marine-derived nutrients (MDN) that catalyze trophic productivity and support rearing juvenile salmon. Salmon spawning also affects hyporheic exchange and movement of dissolved MDN through the stream bed by creating redd topography that induces pumping exchange and by winnowing fine sediment and loosening the bed, which alters hydraulic conductivity and bed porosity. The spatial extent of spawning within the channel likely governs the volume and rate of dissolved MDN exchanged with the stream bed through this process. To explore this issue, we used a two-dimensional groundwater model to predict changes in hyporheic volume, flux, and mean hydraulic residence time of dissolved MDN as a function of the proportion of the bed surface occupied by redds (P). Predictions indicate that hyporheic volume and flux systematically increase with P, while the mean hydraulic residence time of dissolved MDN in the hyporheic zone decreases sharply with P, from 5.79 h on an unspawned bed (P = 0) to 0.03 h for a mass-spawned bed (P = 1.0). Shorter residence time results from hyporheic flux increasing faster than hyporheic volume with higher P. Implications for uptake of dissolved MDN are explored with Damkohler numbers, defined as the ratio of the mean hydraulic residence time to a biogeochemical rate of interest. Given the considerable influence of spawning on hyporheic exchange, additional research is needed to determine conditions under which bioassimilation of dissolved MDN is limited by nutrient supply, extent of the hyporheic zone, or processing rate of MDN in stream beds.Show less"
40,"Singley, JG",May 2017 ,Characterizing hyporheic exchange processes using high-frequency electrical conductivity-discharge relationships on subhourly to interannual timescales,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are often used to quantify source water contributions and biogeochemical processes occurring within catchments, especially during discrete hydrological events. Yet, the interpretation of C-Q hysteresis is often confounded by complexity of the critical zone, such as numerous source waters and hydrochemical nonstationarity. Consequently, researchers must often ignore important runoff pathways and geochemical sources/sinks, especially the hyporheic zone because it lacks a distinct hydrochemical signature. Such simplifications limit efforts to identify processes responsible for the transience of C-Q hysteresis over time. To address these limitations, we leverage the hydrologic simplicity and long-term, high-frequency Q and electrical conductivity (EC) data from streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. In this two end-member system, EC can serve as a proxy for the concentration of solutes derived from the hyporheic zone. We utilize a novel approach to decompose loops into subhysteretic EC-Q dynamics to identify individual mechanisms governing hysteresis across a wide range of timescales. We find that hydrologic and hydraulic processes govern EC response to diel and seasonal Q variability and that the effects of hyporheic mixing processes on C-Q transience differ in short and long streams. We also observe that variable hyporheic turnover rates govern EC-Q patterns at daily to interannual timescales. Last, subhysteretic analysis reveals a period of interannual freshening of glacial meltwater streams related to the effects of unsteady flow on hyporheic exchange. The subhysteretic analysis framework we introduce may be applied more broadly to constrain the processes controlling C-Q transience and advance understanding of catchment evolution.Show less"

In this study, we investigated the impacts of an environmental flow release on water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentrations in surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water at upwelling and downwelling zones in three sites along the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. We hypothesised that the flow pulse would 'flush' the sediments with oxygenated water, stimulating hyporheic microbial activity and nitrification, enhancing nitrate concentrations over time. Surface and subsurface samples were collected before, 7 days after, and 49 days after an environmental flow release of 5000 MI for a period of 3 days. No lasting effects on dissolved oxygen or conductivity were evident at most sites although dissolved oxygen declined over time at the downwelling site at Bowmans Crossing. At the downwelling zones at all sites, hyporheic nitrate concentrations declined initially following the release, but then rose or leveled off by Day 49. This initial drop in concentration was attributed to flushing of nitrate from the sediments. At two sites, nitrate concentrations had increased by Day 49 in the upwelling zones while at the third site, it fell significantly, associated with very low dissolved oxygen and likely reductive loss of nitrate. Electrical conductivity data indicate that potential inputs of agriculturally enriched groundwater may contribute to the nitrogen dynamics of the Hunter River. This study highlights the spatial heterogeneity that occurs in the hyporheic zone within and among sites of a regulated river, and emphasises the need for multiple-site surveys and an understanding of groundwater dynamics to assess physicochemical responses of the hyporheic zone to environmental flow releases.Show less"

The subsurface flow regime at the study site was characterized by a cross sectional hydraulic gradient, with ground water exfiltration at the left margin and surface water infiltration at the right margin; in midstream, horizontal advection along the channel flow prevailed. Measurement of biotic and abiotic parameters were performed down to sediment depths of 150 cm within each hydrological exchange type.Bacterial abundances ranged between 1.6 x 10(5) to 4.8 x 10(8) cells/ml interstitial volume containing water and fine particles and differed significantly between upper and deeper sediment strata. This change with depth was significantly modulated by the type of hydrological exchange. The bacterial carbon portion of total POC varied between 0.06 % and 5.3 % and tended to decrease with depth. Bacteria were most numerous at sediment depths where inflow of stream water occurred, but had been attenuated. Bacterial production was highest in hyporheic interstices dominated by surface water inflow. Bacterial abundance and production were strongly correlated to interstitial particulate organic matter; the best predictor for both was the content of particulate nitrogen, explaining 75 % and 72 % of the variation, respectively. Inclusion of hyporheic positions, defined by sediment depth and hydrological exchange type, improved the explanatory power of models to 88 % and 84 %, respectively. Hyporheic positions provide information on flowpath connections, which were particularly relevant when one uses dissolved organic carbon and interstitial fine sediment as explanatory variables.Abundance of several hyporheic invertebrate taxa, taxa richness and total invertebrate density were positively correlated to bacterial abundance and production. The hyporheic fauna exhibited a gradient between interstitial positions influenced by surface water and those dominated by phreatic ground water. The coupling of sediment depth and hydrological exchange type revealed flowpath connections as being superimposed vectors in determining hyporheic abiotic and biotic gradients.Show less"

However, the nitrogen dynamics in a salinity-impacted hyporheic zone under different saltwater concentrations still remain unclear. In this study, a numerical model coupling the hyporheic flow, salt transport and nitrogen transformations is proposed to investigate how density gradients affect the N2O production and consumption processes in the streambed. The results show that density gradients between infiltrating saltwater and ambient groundwater create gravitational instabilities that significantly accelerate the downward flow of pore water. Such density gradients enhance the species (e.g., dissolved organic carbon and NO3-) mixing efficiency and increase the reaction area, leading to the formation of N2O fingers and promoting the N2O production-consumption rate. The variable-density flow also drags more reactants infiltrating deeper area with longer residence times and increase the frequency of the Damkohler number Da > 1 in the streambed, facilitating the conversion of NO3- to the final product N-2 through stepwise denitrification processes. Therefore, the NO3- removal efficiency and N2O yield are increased by 24% and reduced by 3% at low-density gradients (Delta rho/rho(f) = 7 x 10(-4)), respectively. The possible implications and applications about the effects of hydrodynamic changes due to the density effect are also presented. However, further biogeochemical experiments and river restoration strategies are needed to validate the results of this study.Show less"

This study investigated whether ion exchange process can affect microbially mediated aerobic oxidation of ammonium in a hyporheic zone (HZ) sediments from the Columbia River at US Department of Energy's Hanford site, Washington State. Experiments were conducted using synthetic groundwater and river water to investigate their effect on ammonium oxidation. Results indicated that ammonium sorption through ion exchange reactions decreased the rate of ammonium oxidation, apparently resulting from the influence of the ion exchange on dissolved ammonium concentration, thus decreasing the bioavailability of ammonium for microbial oxidation. However, with the decrease in dissolved ammonium concentration, the sorbed ammonium released back to aqueous phase, and became bioavailable so that all the ammonium in the suspensions were oxidized. Our results implied a dynamic change in ammonium oxidation rates in an environment such as at HZ where river water and groundwater with different chemical compositions exchange frequently that can affect ammonium sorption and desorption through ion exchange reactions.Show less"

To assess the effect of surface-subsurface water exchange on stream water temperature patterns, four alluvial reaches in the Tagliamento River basin (NE Italy), constrained by geomorphic knickpoints at the upper and lower end, and two to four hyporheic flowpaths within each reach, were continuously studied during summer 2007 and winter 2007-08. Water temperature was continuously monitored at the upstream and downstream knickpoints of the floodplains, as well as at discrete upwelling areas within each reach. Discharge and vertical hydraulic gradient were measured along the alluvial reaches, and the residence time and chemistry of upwelling water were assessed four times during the study.3. Discharge variation along the study reaches revealed that massive hyporheic exchange occurred in all sites, ranging from 21% in reach 2-52% in reach 1. End member mixing analysis showed little influence of ground water, as almost all upwelling water was freshly infiltrated hyporheic water. Importantly, hyporheic exchange flows shaped surface temperature at the upwelling locations in all study reaches, providing potential thermal refugia for aquatic biota. At sites with highest hyporheic flow rates, net temperature change was also reflected at the floodplain scale.4. The magnitude of the thermal change along a hyporheic flowpath was not related to the flowpath length but to the estimated Rn-222 water age. Reduction in the diel thermal amplitude by hyporheic flows rather than net temperature change, reduced temperature extremes. Therefore, restoration activities to create thermal refugia should consider the role of hyporheic flows and enhance the exchange between surface and hyporheic waters.Show less"
47,"Wang, XY",Oct 2018 ,Beaver Dams Induce Hyporheic and Biogeochemical Changes in Riparian Areas in a Mountain Peatland,WETLANDS,"Hyporheic exchange is important in increasing stream water transit time through basins and enhancing redox-sensitive biogeochemical reactions influencing downstream water quality. Such exchange may be enhanced by beaver dams which are common throughout low order streams including those originating in peatlands. To understand the influence of beaver dams on hyporheic flows and biogeochemical properties, nitrogen (N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC) and N cycling rates were observed along a beaver dammed, third-order stream draining Canadian Rocky Mountain peatland. Beaver dams enlarged the hyporheric zone from 1.5 to 7.5m. The looping hyporheic flow path created a zone of N and DOC depletion adjacent to the dams. As a result, nitrification rates were lowest in this zone. Where hyporheic flows exited the riparian area and flowed back to the stream channel downstream of a dam, the adjacent riparian area served as a source of N and DOC to the stream. Enhanced nutrient influx to streams owing to beaver dam modified hyporheic flow paths has implications for stream biogeochemical cycling and ecological integrity, which need further exploration.Show less"
48,"Shi, WQ",Mar 10 2020 ,Dynamics of heat transport across sediment deposited hyporheic zone inside reservoirs following hydropower production,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Heat transport through hyporheic zones is critical for many temperature-sensitive biogeochemical processes and survival of aquatic organisms. Water storing and releasing in the reservoir are often made to modify hydropower production, which may cause hydrological variation and alter heat transport regime across the hyporheic zone inside the reservoir. In this study, we investigated heat transport across the hyporheic zone within a sediment deposited bar inside a hydropower reservoir on the mainstream of the upper Mekong River. Hydrothermal dynamics in the hyporheic zone following hydropower production were analyzed by monitoring changes of water level and temperature using automatic monitoring wells. Results showed that hydropower production induced water level fluctuations, enhanced hyporheic exchanges and thereby accelerated heat transport across the bar. The hyporheic zone was a heat source for the reservoir water regardless of the time of the year. In summer, heat transport from the bar hyporheic zone to the reservoir was strong (0.50 x 10(8)-10.28 x 10(8) J m(-1) d(-1)) and mainly occurred through near-surface sediment layer (0-0.5 m), which was attributed to active hyporheic exchanges and strong solar radiation. In winter, heat transport was weak (0.01 x 10(8)-1.01 x 10(8) J m(-1) d(-1)) and mainly occurred in sediment bottom layer (<1.0m) with limited energy inputs from microbial activities. This study adds to our understanding of hydrothermal dynamics in hyporheic zones under flow regulations by dams. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
49,"Saccardi, B",Dec 2021 ,"Improving Predictions of Stream CO2 Concentrations and Fluxes Using a Stream Network Model: A Case Study in the East River Watershed, CO, USA",GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,"Inland waters are an important component of the global carbon budget. However, our ability to predict carbon fluxes from stream systems remains uncertain, as pCO(2) varies within streams at scales of 1-100 m. This makes direct monitoring of large-scale CO2 fluxes impractical. We incorporate CO2 input and output fluxes into a stream network advection-reaction model, representing the first process-based representation of stream CO2 dynamics at watershed scales. This model includes groundwater (GW) CO2 inputs, water column (WC), benthic hyporheic zone (BHZ) respiration, downstream advection, and atmospheric exchange. We evaluate this model against existing statistical methods including upscaling and multiple linear regressions through comparisons to high-resolution stream pCO(2) data collected across the East River Watershed in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA). The stream network model accurately captures GW, evasion, and respiration-driven pCO(2) variability and significantly outperforms multiple linear regressions for predicting pCO(2). Further, the model provides estimates of CO2 contributions from internal versus external sources suggesting that streams transition from GW- to BHZ-dominated sources between 3rd and 4th Strahler orders, with GW, BHZ, and WC accounting for 49.3%, 50.6%, and 0.1% of CO2 fluxes from the watershed, respectively. Lastly, stream network model atmospheric CO2 fluxes are 4-12x times smaller than upscaling technique predictions, largely due to relationships between stream pCO(2) and gas exchange velocities. Taken together, this stream network model improves our ability to predict stream CO2 dynamics and efflux. Furthermore, future applications to regional and global scales may result in a significant downward revision of global flux estimates.Show less"
