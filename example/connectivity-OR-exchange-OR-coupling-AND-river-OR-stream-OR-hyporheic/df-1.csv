0,"Feng, JH",Dec 31 2022 ,Hyporheic exchange due to in-stream geomorphic structures,JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,"In-stream structures, such as channel spanning logs and weirs, can enhance hyporheic exchange in streams. Hyporheic exchange is important for stream ecosystem function, and restoring this function is a goal of many stream restoration projects. However, studies on the connection between in-stream structure size, hydrogeologic setting, and hyporheic exchange remain inadequately characterized. In this study, we combined flume experiments and numerical simulations to systematically evaluate how in-stream structure and its hydrogeologic setting impacted the hyporheic vertical exchange flux, Q, the solute penetration depth, D-p, and the solute flux, QS, in the hyporheic zone. The results showed that stream water downwells into the riverbed upstream of the weir and upwells downstream. Exchange rates were greatest near the weir and decay with distance upstream and downstream. Model results indicated Q, D-p and QS had a positive exponential relationship with the weir height, h, the flow velocity, u, and the sediment intrinsic permeability, k. While model results indicated that u was the most important factor determining Q, D-p and QS, followed by h, while only h reached a certain value, the hyporheic exchange would increase with the height and vice versa. Hyporheic exchange generally was sensitive to changes in k, only the magnitude of k varied from 10(-8)-10(-10)m(2). This finding suggests that a rethinking of the currently applied restoration techniques is required to better consider in-stream structure size, hydrological conditions and natural substratum dynamics in river restoration.Show less"
1,"McCluskey, AH",Oct 2016 ,Flipping the thin film model: Mass transfer by hyporheic exchange in gaining and losing streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of mass between a stream and its hyporheic zone, or hyporheic exchange, is central to many important ecosystem services. In this paper we show that mass transfer across the streambed by linear mechanisms of hyporheic exchange in a gaining or losing stream can be represented by a thin film model in which (a) the mass transfer coefficient is replaced with the average Darcy flux of water downwelling into the sediment and (b) the driving force for mass transfer is flipped from normal to the surface (concentration difference across a boundary layer) to parallel to the surface (concentration difference across downwelling and upwelling zones). Our analysis is consistent with previously published analytical, computational, and experimental studies of hyporheic exchange in the presence of stream-groundwater interactions, and links stream network, advection-dispersion, and stochastic descriptions of solute fate and transport in rivers.Show less"
2,"Kasahara, T",Jan 10 2003 ,Geomorphic controls on hyporheic exchange flow in mountain streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Hyporheic exchange flows were simulated using MODFLOW and MODPATH to estimate relative effects of channel morphologic features on the extent of the hyporheic zone, on hyporheic exchange flow, and on the residence time of stream water in the hyporheic zone. Four stream reaches were compared in order to examine the influence of stream size and channel constraint. Within stream reaches, the influence of pool-step or pool-riffle sequences, channel sinuosity, secondary channels, and channel splits was examined. Results showed that the way in which channel morphology controlled exchange flows differed with stream size and, in some cases, with channel constraint. Pool-step sequences drove hyporheic exchange in the second-order sites, creating exchange flows with relatively short residence times. Multiple features interacted to drive hyporheic exchange flow in the unconstrained fifth-order site, where pool-riffle sequences and a channel split created exchange flows with short residence times, whereas a secondary channel created exchange flows with long residence times. There was relatively little exchange flow in the bedrock-constrained fifth-order site. Groundwater flow models were effective in examining the morphologic features that controlled hyporheic exchange flow, and surface-visible channel morphologic features controlled the development of the hyporheic zone in these mountain streams.Show less"
3,"Boulton, AJ",Apr 2007 ,Hyporheic rehabilitation in rivers: restoring vertical connectivity,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The hyporheic zone below the channel and banks of many rivers where surface water and ground water exchanges plays a crucial functional role in the biogeochemical transformation of water, mediated by active microbial biofilms. This zone also harbours assemblages of invertebrates that graze biofilms, contribute to secondary production, and can alter the porosity of the hyporheic zone through their movement or burrowing activities.2. Many human activities cause interstitial sedimentation or disrupt surface-groundwater hydrological linkages, impacting upon ecological processes in the hyporheic zone. However, strategies for river rehabilitation seldom explicitly consider the hyporheic zone or seek to restore lost vertical linkages with groundwater. Instead, restoration goals target surface, riparian or floodplain features even though current river ecosystem theory emphasises the three dimensions of hydrological connectivity. To guide effective, holistic river restoration, scientists and managers therefore need information on the mechanisms by which energy and material are transferred in the hyporheic zone and which ecosystem services are thus provided.3. Other gaps in our understanding of hyporheic zone rehabilitation include recruitment processes of the hyporheos and the relative importance of groups of hyporheic invertebrates in rivers differing in substratum size, disturbance frequency and groundwater linkages. Carefully designed experiments that assess responses to hyporheic rehabilitation strategies will provide valuable data at varying scales (e.g. distribution of hyporheic habitat types at the reach scale) for management as well as providing insights into the mechanisms controlling hyporheic invertebrate assemblages and ecological processes. Fully successful river rehabilitation must include restoration of vertical linkages between the river and its shallow groundwater aquifers.Show less"
4,"Wright, KK",Sep 2005 ,Restricted hyporheic exchange in an alluvial river system: implications for theory and management,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Large-scale patterns of hyporheic exchange are predictable within some river systems, but our understanding of the factors driving hyporheic processes and the magnitude of hyporheic exchange needed to influence biophysical patterns at larger scales remains limited. We investigated the patterns, magnitude, and potential effects on biota of reach-scale hyporheic exchange in an alluvial river of the Pacific Northwest. The river was topographically similar to and in the same geographic region as other systems where large-scale hyporheic exchange and associated biological responses have been observed. We hypothesized that predictable reach-scale patterns of hyporheic exchange would occur in alluvial valley segments of the river and that hyporheic upwelling would be associated with reach-scale patterns of physical and biological characteristics. We used in-channel piezometers and synoptic stream flow measurements to quantify hyporheic exchange. We measured temperature, dissolved O-2, pH, specific conductivity, chlorophyll a biomass, primary production, and benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of physical and biological responses. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence, physical or biological, of reach-scale hyporheic exchange. Hyporheic connectivity in this river system probably is constrained by geologic and geomorphic characters as well as the legacy of human land use in the basin. Thus, our results illustrate the variability of hyporheic processes that can occur among alluvial river systems and may have implications for watershed management.Show less"
5,"Herzog, SP",Dec 2019 ,Multiscale Feature-feature Interactions Control Patterns of Hyporheic Exchange in a Simulated Headwater Mountain Stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Recent predictions of hyporheic exchange at the basin-scale assume individual features control exchange independently of each other, which has been demonstrated in relatively uniform, low-gradient rivers. However, this assumption may not hold in steep catchments where both the type and size of individual features may vary over short distances, leading to irregular patterns of feature dominance on hyporheic exchange flows. Also, steep longitudinal gradients support substantial downvalley flows in the subsurface, which may create feedbacks between adjacent features. In this study, we test the extent to which features interact with one another and whether they can be aggregated to make reach-scale predictions in a headwater mountain stream. Using systematic manipulations of a 2-D stream centerline model and spectral analyses, we test for the presence of both feature-feature and multiscale interactions. Our results show that changing the height of individual step-pool features can alter hyporheic flow fields in neighboring, and sometimes distant, features. Spectral analyses revealed two scales of streambed topography-a local scale of single features and an intermediate scale that spanned multiple local-scale features. All features produced hyporheic exchange, but turnover of deeper hyporheic water only occurred at a few key locations where local- and intermediate-scale features amplified each other. Further, shallow bedrock increases the ratio of local- and intermediate-scale flowpaths to regional-scale flowpaths. Conceptual models portraying hyporheic exchange as a series of nested flowpaths should include the interactions among streambed topographic features in mountain streams. These results have implications for upscaling, field experiments, and stream restoration in steep catchments.Show less"
6,"Lu, CP",Dec 2020 ,Event-Driven Hyporheic Exchange during Single and Seasonal Rainfall in a Gaining Stream,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"This study combined a reach-scale field survey and numerical modelling analysis to reveal the pattern of transient hyporheic exchange driven by rainfall events in the Zhongtian River, Southeast China. Field observations revealed hydrodynamic properties and flux variations in surface water (SW)/ groundwater (GW), suggesting that the regional groundwater recharged the study reach. A two-step numerical modelling procedure, including a hydraulic surface flow model and a groundwater flow model, was then used to interpret the transient hyporheic flow system. The hyporheic exchange exhibited strong temporal evolution in the study reach, as indicated by the rainfall event-driven hyporheic exchange. The reversal of the hydraulic gradient and transient hyporheic exchange were simulated using numerical simulation. Anisotropic hydraulic conductivity is the key to generating transient hyporheic exchange. A revised conceptual model was used to interpret the observed temporal patterns in hyporheic exchange. The seasonal rainfall events generate transient hyporheic exchange, and the pattern of transient hyporheic exchange indicates that transient hyporheic exchange appears only after an increased phase of the river stage but does not last long. The temporal pattern of hyporheic exchange can significantly affect the hydrodynamic exchange and the evolution of hydrology in the hyporheic zone for a gaining stream, and these results have important guiding significance for the comprehensive management of surface water and groundwater quantity and quality.Show less"
7,"Tewari, A",Feb 2022 ,Engineered hyporheic zones: design and applications in stream health restoration- a review,WATER SUPPLY,"Anthropogenic deterioration of streams and rivers have affected their surface-subsurface linkages. This has led to the degradation of hyporheic zones, a sensitive interface between stream channel and its surrounding sediments, responsible for transforming pollutants, natural solutes and supporting benthic communities. Several authors have reported the influence of stream restoration measures on hyporheic exchanges and have called for the inclusion of hyporheic zone restorations in stream management. Engineered Hyporheic Zones (EHZ) is the creation of artificial transition area due to induced hyporheic flows, brought about by some feature modifications done to the stream channel or its subsurface. These feature modifications and its implications have been investigated through lab experiments, outdoor flumes, modelling and field studies for several years. This paper attempts to summarize the endeavours made in the study of EHZ and its applications in water quality improvement and habitat restoration. A comprehensive review of upto date literature with specific focus on the influence of engineered structures on hyporheic exchanges is presented, followed by the comparison of preferences opted for different studies and their limitations. The paper ends with suggestive future scope in EHZ studies and its potential as a low cost alternative treatment technology for river restoration.Show less"
8,"Wondzell, SM",Oct 30 2011 ,The role of the hyporheic zone across stream networks,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Many hyporheic papers state that the hyporheic zone is a critical component of stream ecosystems, and many of these papers focus on the biogeochemical effects of the hyporheic zone on stream solute loads. However, efforts to show such relationships have proven elusive, prompting several questions: Are the effects of the hyporheic zone on stream ecosystems so highly variable in place and time (or among streams) that a consistent relationship should not be expected? Or, is the hyporheic zone less important in stream ecosystems than is commonly expected? These questions were examined using data from existing groundwater modelling studies of hyporheic exchange flow at five sites in a fifth-order, mountainous stream network. The size of exchange flows, relative to stream discharge (Q(HEF) : Q), was large only in very small streams at low discharge (area approximate to 100 ha; Q < 10 l/s). At higher flows (flow exceedance probability > 0.7) and in all larger streams, QHEF : Q was small. These data show that biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone of small streams can substantially influence the stream's solute load, but these processes become hydrologically constrained at high discharge or in larger streams and rivers. The hyporheic zone may influence stream ecosystems in many ways, however, not just through biogeochemical processes that alter stream solute loads. For example, the hyporheic zone represents a unique habitat for some organisms, with patterns and amounts of upwelling and downwelling water determining the underlying physiochemical environment of the hyporheic zone. Similarly, hyporheic exchange creates distinct patches of downwelling and upwelling. Upwelling environments are of special interest, because upwelling water has the potential to be thermally or chemically distinct from stream water. Consequently, micro-environmental patches created by hyporheic exchange flows are likely to be important to biological and ecosystem processes, even if their impact on stream solute loads is small.

9,"Huang, P",Oct 2022 ,Hyporheic Exchange in a Straight Stream With Alternate Bars,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange (HE) is essential to riverine ecosystem, water quality, and energy cycling in a stream due to its governing role in physicochemical and biological processes in hyporheic zone (HZ). Alternate bars, characterized by a repetitive sequence of diagonal bars with a pool-riffle bedform, are common geomorphic features that generally form in straight streams. Following similar laboratory and numerical methodology as Huang and Chui (2021, ) who investigated the HE induced by pool-riffle sequences, this study focused on the HE induced by alternate bars (i.e., geomorphic features on stream banks instead of streambed) where the influences of key factors were systematically examined. The results show that alternate bars strongly influence surface flow and induce significant hyporheic flows in both stream banks and streambed, whose patterns, magnitudes, and influential patterns of key factors could be similar to the HE induced by pool-riffle sequences. The HE flowrate increases linearly with discharge, bed slope, and bar spacing. However, influential patterns of bar width on HE vary, and the bar width changes the influential patterns of discharge and bed slope on HZ scale, highlighting the influence of bar width in the complex interactions among discharge, bed slope, and bar width. All indicators of HE characteristics generally increase with bar spacing and follow exponential relationships with groundwater flow. Findings in this study lay the foundation in research on riparian ecosystems and water quality in the streams with alternate bars and help guide the design of bars during river restorations.Show less"

11,"Boano, F",Jan 2007 ,Bedform-induced hyporheic exchange with unsteady flows,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The interaction between surface and subsurface water has a crucial influence on the biochemistry of stream environments. Even though the river discharge and the flow conditions can seldom be considered to be steady, the influence of this unsteadiness on the hyporheic exchange has often been neglected. In this work, a model for the study of hyporheic exchange during unsteady conditions has been developed. The model provides a sound analytical framework for the analysis of the effects of a varying stream discharge on the exchange between a stream and the hyporheic zone. The effects of the unsteadiness on the water exchange flux, the residence time of the solutes in the bed, and the stored mass are quantified. A synthetic example shows the substantial influence of a flood on the hyporheic exchange, and that the application of a steady model can lead to an underestimation of the exchanged mass, even after the flood has ended.

12,"Worman, A",Jan 2002 ,Effect of flow-induced exchange in hyporheic zones on longitudinal transport of solutes in streams and rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Temporary storage of solutes in streams is often controlled by flow-induced uptake in hyporheic zones. This phenomenon accounts for the tails that are generally observed following the passage of a solute pulse, and such exchange is particularly important for the transport of reactive substances that can be subject to various biogeochemical processes in the subsurface. Advective pumping, induced by streamflow over an irregular permeable bed, leads to a distribution of pore water flow paths in the streambed and a corresponding distribution of subsurface solute residence times. This paper describes a modeling framework that couples longitudinal solute transport in streams with solute advection along a continuous distribution of hyporheic flow paths. Moment methods are used to calculate the shape of solute breakthrough curves in the stream based on various representations of hypotheic exchange, including both advective pumping and several idealized formulations. Basic hydrodynamic principles are used to derive the distribution of solute residence times due to pumping. The model provides an accurate representation of the breakthrough curves of tritium along a 30 km reach of Sava Brook in Uppland County in Sweden. Both hydrodynamic theory for pumping exchange and pore water samples obtained from the bed during the tracer experiment suggest that the residence time for solutes in the hyporheic zone is characterized by a log normal probability density function. Closed-form solutions of the central temporal moments of solute breakthrough curves in the stream reveal a significant similarity between this new model and existing models of hyporheic exchange, including the Transient Storage Model. The new model is advantageous because its fundamentally derived exchange parameters can be expressed as functions of basic hydrodynamic quantities, which allows the model results to be generalized to conditions beyond those directly observed during tracer experiments. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using the pumping theory to relate the spatial variation of hyporheic exchange rate along Sava Brook with the local Froude number, hydraulic conductivity and water depth.Show less"
13,"Cozzetto, KD",Sep 2013 ,The influence of stream thermal regimes and preferential flow paths on hyporheic exchange in a glacial meltwater stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Given projected increases in stream temperatures attributable to global change, improved understanding of relationships between stream temperatures and hyporheic exchange would be useful. We conducted two conservative tracer injection experiments in a glacial meltwater stream, to evaluate the effects of hyporheic thermal gradients on exchange processes, including preferential flow paths (PFPs). The experiments were conducted on the same day, the first (a stream injection) during a cool, morning period and the second (dual stream and hyporheic injections) during a warm, afternoon period. In the morning, the hyporheic zone was thermally uniform at 4 degrees C, whereas by the afternoon the upper 10 cm had warmed to 6-12 degrees C and exhibited greater temperature heterogeneity. Solute transport modeling showed that hyporheic cross-sectional areas (A(s)) at two downstream sites were two and seven times lower during the warm experiment. Exchange metrics indicated that the hyporheic zone had less influence on downstream solute transport during the warm, afternoon experiment. Calculated hyporheic depths were less than 5 cm, contrasting with tracer detection at 10 and 25 cm depths. The hyporheic tracer arrival at one downstream site was rapid, comparable to the in-stream tracer arrival, providing evidence for PFPs. We thus propose a conceptual view of the hyporheic zone in this reach as being dominated by discrete PFPs weaving through hydraulically isolated areas. One explanation for the simultaneous increase in temperature heterogeneity and A(s) decrease in a warmer hyporheic zone may be a flow path preferentiality feedback mechanism resulting from a combination of temperature-related viscosity decreases and streambed heterogeneity.Show less"

15,"Wyatt, KH",Jul 2008 ,Benthic algal response to hyporheic-surface water exchange in an alluvial river,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"We studied the response of benthic algae to points of hyporheic-surface water exchange in the main channel of the Middle Fork Flathead River within the Nyack Flood Plain, Montana. We examined hyporheic exchange at 120 sites using piezometers and measuring vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG), hydraulic conductivity, and vertical discharge. We removed benthic algae from a single cobble at each site, and we used VHG to group sampling sites for statistical analysis. Algal cell density and chlorophyll a concentration were significantly higher at sites with hyporheic discharge (+VHG, upwelling) compared to both sites with hyporheic recharge (-VHG, downwelling) and sites with no hyporheic-surface water exchange (=VHG, neutral) (ANOVA, P < 0.05). The assemblages of algae at upwelling sites were also significantly different from downwelling and neutral exchange sites (ANOSIM, P < 0.05). Filamentous green algae Stigeoclonium sp. and Zygnema sp. and a chrysophyte, Hydrurus foetidus (Villars) Trevisan were abundant at upwelling sites, whereas an assemblage of diatoms Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki, Cymbella excisa Kutzing, Diatoma moniliformis Kutzing, and Gomphonema olivaceoides Hustedt, were the most abundant taxa at downwelling and neutral exchange sites, occurring attached to, or in close association with the stalks of Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) Schmidt. These data show that benthic algal communities are structured differently depending on the direction of hyporheic flux in the main channel of a large alluvial river, suggesting that hyporheic-surface exchange may influence the spatial distribution of main-channel benthic algae in rivers with hyporheic-surface water connectivity.Show less"
16,"Di Lorenzo, T",Jun 2013 ,Incorporating the hyporheic zone within the river discontinuum: Longitudinal patterns of subsurface copepod assemblages in an Alpine stream,LIMNOLOGICA,"At coarse spatial scales, Alpine streams are patchy discontinuum environments from headwaters to mouth. This condition may have profound implications on the structure and function of the hyporheic ecotone. This study was aimed at assessing whether meiofaunal copepod assemblages displayed a longitudinal zonation corresponding to discontinuities along an Alpine stream profile determined by changes of geology and alternating canyon and floodplain segments. Moreover, the study aimed at testing, at a regional scale, the potential role of copepods as describers of surface-subsurface hydrological exchanges in the hyporheic zone. The results indicated that copepod assemblage compositions changed according to geomorphological and physicochemical stream longitudinal discontinuities. The headwater upwelling sector of the stream predominantly harboured stygobiotic species; the intermediate sector, where stream water is in hydrodynamic equilibrium with ground water, was characterised by the highest species richness and abundances both of stygobiotic and non-stygobiotic species; the downstream alluvial fan, where downwelling occurred, was defined by high non-stygobiotic species richness along with low occurrence of stygobionts. The different distribution of stygobiotic and non-stygobiotic species in gaining and losing sectors of this Alpine stream suggested the role of copepods as describers of the hydrological flowpaths in the hyporheic zone at the catchment scale.

17,"Sparacino, MS",Jan 2019 ,Form-based river restoration decreases wetland hyporheic exchange: Lessons learned from the Upper Colorado River,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Restoration of river-wetland systems to recover lost ecosystem services and restore consistent flood regimes is commonly directed at modifying in-channel storage and hyporheic exchange. Here, we monitored the hydrologic response to channel realignment in a montane river-wetland system by comparing pre- and post-restoration measurements. In 2015, an earthen berm and 190 m segment of the Upper Colorado River were constructed to consolidate flow from multiple channels into the historic thalweg. We injected a sodium chloride tracer during baseflow and used mass-balance calculations and electrical resistivity imaging to assess changes in near-channel hyporheic exchange. Results indicate a decrease in hyporheic exchange within the wetland due to lost complexity along the consolidated flow path. Subsurface complexity appears to control hyporheic exchange more than surface complexity. Flow consolidation increased the area-adjusted wetland water yield by 231 mm, indicating a loss of wetland water storage capacity. One year of post-restoration monitoring suggests that the form-based channel restoration directed at consolidating flow into a single thread adversely affected the hyporheic exchange functioning in the pre-restoration system. Results from this case study are applicable to restoration planners as they consider the effects of form-based projects on water storage capacity in similar systems.

18,"Marzadri, A",Nov 27 2014 ,Multi-scale streambed topographic and discharge effects on hyporheic exchange at the stream network scale in confined streams,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hyporheic zone is the volume of the streambed sediment mostly saturated with stream water. It is the transitional zone between stream and shallow-ground waters and an important ecotone for benthic species, including macro-invertebrates, microorganisms, and some fish species that dwell in the hyporheic zone for parts of their lives. Most hyporheic analyses are limited in scope, performed at the reach scale with hyporheic exchange mainly driven by one mechanism, such as interaction between flow and ripples or dunes. This research investigates hyporheic flow induced by the interaction of flow and streambed topography at the valley-scale under different discharges. We apply a pumping based hyporheic model along a 37 km long reach of the Deadwood River for different flow releases from Deadwood Reservoir and at different discharges of its tributaries. We account for dynamic head variations, induced by interactions of small-scale topography and flow, and piezometric head variations, caused by reach-scale bathymetry-flow interactions. We model the dynamic head variations as those caused by dune-like bedforms and piezometric heads with the water surface elevation predicted with a 1-dimensional, 1D, hydraulic model supported by close-spaced cross-sections extracted every channel width from high-resolution bathymetry. Superposition of these two energy-head components provides the boundary condition at the water-sediment interface for the hyporheic model. Our results show that small- and large-scale streambed features induce fluxes of comparable magnitude but the former and the latter dominate fluxes with short and long residence times, respectively. In our setting, stream discharge and alluvium thickness have limited effects on hyporheic processes including the thermal regime of the hyporheic zone. Bed topography is a strong predictor of hyporheic exchange and the 10 wavelet is a convenient way to describe the bed topography quantitatively. Thus wavelet power could be a good index for hyporheic potential, with areas of high and low wavelet power coinciding with high and low hyporheic fluxes, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

19,"King, TV",Mar 2019 ,Quantifying Reach-Average Effects of Hyporheic Exchange on Arctic River Temperatures in an Area of Continuous Permafrost,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange has the potential to significantly influence river temperatures in regions of continuous permafrost under low-flow conditions given the strong thermal gradients that exist in river bed sediments. However, there is limited understanding of the impacts of hyporheic exchange on Arctic river temperatures. To address this knowledge gap, heat fluxes associated with hyporheic exchange were estimated in a fourth-order Arctic river using field observations coupled with a river temperature model that accounts for hyporheic exchange influences. Temperature time series and tracer study solute breakthrough curves were measured in the main channel and river bed at multiple locations and depths to characterize hyporheic exchange and provide parameter bounds for model calibration. Model results for low-flow periods from 3 years indicated that hyporheic exchange contributed up to 27% of the total river energy balance, reduced the main channel diel temperature range by up to 1.7 degrees C, and reduced mean daily temperatures by up to 0.21 degrees C over a 13.1-km study reach. These influences are due to main channel heat loss during the day and gain at night via hyporheic exchange and heat loss from the hyporheic zone to the ground below via conduction. Main channel temperatures were found to be sensitive to simulated changes in ground temperatures due to changes in hyporheic exchange heat flux and deeper ground conduction. These results suggest that the moderating influence of hyporheic exchange could be reduced if ground temperatures warm in response to projected increases in permafrost thaw below rivers.Show less"
20,"Mori, N",Jun 2011 ,The effect of in-stream gravel extraction in a pre-alpine gravel-bed river on hyporheic invertebrate community,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"We investigated the effect of in-stream gravel extraction in a pre-alpine gravel-bed river on hyporheic invertebrate community, together with changes in the hyporheic geomorphology, physico-chemistry and biofilm activity. Hyporheic invertebrates were collected, together with environmental data, on seven sampling occasions from June 2004 to May 2005, at two river reaches-at the site of in-stream gravel extraction and at a site 2.5 km upstream. The hyporheic samples were taken from the river bed and from the gravel bars extending laterally from the stream channel. The invertebrate community was dominated by insect larvae (occasional hyporheos), followed by meiofauna (permanent hyporheos). Stygobionts were present at low species richness and in low densities. Gravel extraction from the stream channel led to changes in the patterns of water exchange between surface and subsurface and changes in the sediment composition at the site. Immediate reductions in density and taxonomic richness of invertebrates were observed, together with changes in their community composition. The hyporheic invertebrate community in the river recovered relatively fast (in 2.5 months) by means of density and taxonomic richness, while by means of community composition invertebrates needed 5-7 months to recover. The impact of fine sediments (< 0.1 mm) on biofilm activity measured through ETS activity and hyporheic invertebrate density and taxonomic richness was strongly confirmed in this study.Show less"
21,"Argerich, A",Sep 2011 ,Temporal variation of hydrological exchange and hyporheic biogeochemistry in a headwater stream during autumn,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The hyporheic zone is of great interest for stream ecologists because of its role in stream biogeochemical processing. Our study addresses the effects of leaf-litter inputs and varying discharge on surface-hyporheic water exchange and their possible consequences for the hyporheic zone biogeochemistry. Our study was conducted during autumn in Riera de Santa Fe (northeastern Iberian Peninsula), a stream with a well developed deciduous riparian canopy. We placed 15 wells spaced at 5-m intervals longitudinally down the study reach and measured surface and hyporheic nutrient and dissolved O-2 (DO) concentrations on 23 sampling dates (15 during the leaffall period and 8 after a flood that washed out 65% of the accumulated leaf biomass). We assessed changes in surface-water exchange and in hyporheic NH4-N and soluble reactive P (SRP) uptake via coinjection of a conservative tracer and nutrients. Compared to surface water, hyporheic water had lower DO, higher SRP and NO3-N concentrations, and similar NH4-N concentration. Hyporheic water had higher DO saturation (p = 0.00) and higher NH4-N concentration (p = 0.00) in downwelling than in upwelling wells, whereas SRP and NO3-N concentrations did not differ significantly between well types (p > 0.05). Hydrologic connectivity was higher in downwelling than in upwelling wells and decreased with leaf-litter accumulation in the stream channel and increased with stream discharge. Increased connectivity after a flood reduced the difference in DO between surface and hyporheic compartments in upwelling and downwelling wells and in NO3-N in upwelling wells. NH4-N and SRP uptake responded differently to these changes. Hyporheic SRP uptake rate was controlled by hyporheic SRP concentration, which did not vary with changes in connectivity, whereas NH4-N uptake rate was indirectly affected by changes in connectivity through the influence of connectivity on DO availability. Last, although no NO3-N was added during the solute injections, we observed an increase in hyporheic NO3-N that probably was caused by nitrification. Together these results illustrate how the combination of stream hydrology and organic matter accumulation can dictate seasonal changes in hyporheic biogeochemistry.Show less"
22,"Harvey, J",Apr 2019 ,How Hydrologic Connectivity Regulates Water Quality in River Corridors,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Downstream flow in rivers is repeatedly delayed by hydrologic exchange with off-channel storage zones where biogeochemical processing occurs. We present a dimensionless metric that quantifies river connectivity as the balance between downstream flow and the exchange of water with the bed, banks, and floodplains. The degree of connectivity directly influences downstream water quality - too little connectivity limits the amount of river water exchanged and leads to biogeochemically inactive water storage, while too much connectivity limits the contact time with sediments for reactions to proceed. Using a metric of reaction significance based on river connectivity, we provide evidence that intermediate levels of connectivity, rather than the highest or lowest levels, are the most efficient in removing nitrogen from Northeastern United States' rivers. Intermediate connectivity balances the frequency, residence time, and contact volume with reactive sediments, which can maximize the reactive processing of dissolved contaminants and the protection of downstream water quality. Our simulations suggest denitrification dominantly occurs in riverbed hyporheic zones of streams and small rivers, whereas vertical turbulent mixing in contact with sediments dominates in mid-size to large rivers. The metrics of connectivity and reaction significance presented here can facilitate scientifically based prioritizations of river management strategies to protect the values and functions of river corridors.Show less"

In practice, it is difficult to model hyporheic flow over the wide spectrum of topographic features typically found in rivers. As a result, many studies only characterize isolated exchange processes at a single spatial scale. In this work, we simulated hyporheic flows induced by a range of geomorphic features including meanders, bars and dunes in sand bed streams. Twenty cases were examined with 5 degrees of river meandering. Each meandering river model was run initially without any small topographic features. Models were run again after superimposing only bars and then only dunes, and then run a final time after including all scales of topographic features. This allowed us to investigate the relative importance and interactions between flows induced by different scales of topography. We found that dunes typically contributed more to hyporheic exchange than bars and meanders. Furthermore, our simulations show that the volume of water exchanged and the distributions of hyporheic residence times resulting from various scales of topographic features are close to, but not linearly additive. These findings can potentially be used to develop scaling laws for hyporheic flow that can be widely applied in streams and rivers.Show less"
24,"Lu, CP",Sep 2017 ,Heat tracing to determine spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange across a river transect,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Significant spatial variability of water fluxes may exist at the water-sediment interface in river channels and has great influence on a variety of water issues. Understanding the complicated flow systems controlling the flux exchanges along an entire river is often limited due to averaging of parameters or the small number of discrete point measurements usually used. This study investigated the spatial pattern of the hyporheic flux exchange across a river transect in China, using the heat tracing approach. This was done with measurements of temperature at high spatial resolution during a 64-h monitoring period and using the data to identify the spatial pattern of the hyporheic exchange flux with the aid of a one-dimensional conduction-advection-dispersion model (VFLUX). The threshold of neutral exchange was considered as 126 L m(-2) d(-1) in this study and the heat tracing results showed that the change patterns of vertical hyporheic flux varied with buried depth along the river transect; however, the hyporheic flux was not simply controlled by the streambed hydraulic conductivity and water depth in the river transect. Also, lateral flow dominated the hyporheic process within the shallow high-permeability streambed, while the vertical flow was dominant in the deep low-permeability streambed. The spatial pattern of hyporheic exchange across the river transect was naturally controlled by the heterogeneity of the streambed and the bedform of the stream cross-section. Consequently, a two-dimensional conceptual illustration of the hyporheic process across the river transect is proposed, which could be applicable to river transects of similar conditions.Show less"

Ecological functions are known to be spatially and temporally variable, but spatial dimensions of the problem are not easily quantified and thus they are usually overlooked. To estimate the spatial patterns of connectivity, and how connectivity varies with changes in discharge, we developed the hyporheic potential model. We used the model to interpret a series of solute tracer injections in two headwater mountain streams with contrasting valley bottom morphologies to estimate connectivity in the stream corridor. The distributions of flow path origination locations and the lengths of hyporheic flow paths appear to vary with base flow recession, even in cases where transport timescales are apparently unchanged. The modeled distribution of origination locations further allowed us to define a spatial analog to the temporal window of detection associated with solute tracer studies, and enables assessment of connectivity dynamics between streams and their corridors. Altogether, the reduced complexity hyporheic potential model provides an easy way to anticipate the spatial distribution and origination locations of hyporheic flow paths from a basic understanding of the valley bottom characteristics and solute transport timescales.Plain Language Summary The manuscript details a simple method to assess the spatial connectivity of streams and their riparian zones. While the timescales of exchange in the river corridor have been broadly studied, the complimentary spatial dimension (i.e., the geometry of exchange flowpaths) remains largely unknown. The major challenge in assessing the spatial dimensions of exchange is the limited information available in the subsurface. Here, we develop a reduced complexity model of valley bottom transport to overcome these information limitations. With this model, relatively simple field site characterization and solute tracer data are combined to assess the spatial distribution of downwelling along a headwater mountain stream. We validate the model with a numerical experiment, and demonstrate its application in two watersheds of contrasting geology, repeated through baseflow recession.Show less"
27,"Magliozzi, C",Jan 2019 ,A multiscale statistical method to identify potential areas of hyporheic exchange for river restoration planning,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is an area of interaction between surface and ground waters present in and around river beds. Bidirectional mixing within the HZ, termed hyporheic exchange flow (HEF), plays significant roles in nutrient transport, organic matter and biogeochemical processing in rivers. The functional importance of the HZ in river ecology and hydrology suggests that river managers should consider the HZ in their planning to help compromised systems recover. However, current river restoration planning tools do not take into account the HZ. This paper describes a novel multiscale, transferable method that combines existing environmental information at different spatial scales to identify areas with potentially significant HEF for use in restoration prioritization and planning. It uses a deductive approach that is suited for data-poor case studies, which is common for most rivers, given the very limited data on the spatial occurrence of areas of hyporheic exchange. Results on nine contrasting European rivers, demonstrate its potential to inform river management.Show less"
28,"Azizian, M",May 2017 ,Ambient groundwater flow diminishes nitrate processing in the hyporheic zone of streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Modeling and experimental studies demonstrate that ambient groundwater reduces hyporheic exchange, but the implications of this observation for stream N-cycling is not yet clear. Here we utilize a simple process-based model (the Pumping and Streamline Segregation or PASS model) to evaluate N-cycling over two scales of hyporheic exchange (fluvial ripples and riffle-pool sequences), ten ambient groundwater and stream flow scenarios (five gaining and losing conditions and two stream discharges), and three biogeochemical settings (identified based on a principal component analysis of previously published measurements in streams throughout the United States). Model-data comparisons indicate that our model provides realistic estimates for direct denitrification of stream nitrate, but overpredicts nitrification and coupled nitrification-denitrification. Riffle-pool sequences are responsible for most of the N-processing, despite the fact that fluvial ripples generate 3-11 times more hyporheic exchange flux. Across all scenarios, hyporheic exchange flux and the Damkohler Number emerge as primary controls on stream N-cycling; the former regulates trafficking of nutrients and oxygen across the sediment-water interface, while the latter quantifies the relative rates of organic carbon mineralization and advective transport in streambed sediments. Vertical groundwater flux modulates both of these master variables in ways that tend to diminish stream N-cycling. Thus, anthropogenic perturbations of ambient groundwater flows (e.g., by urbanization, agricultural activities, groundwater mining, and/or climate change) may compromise some of the key ecosystem services provided by streams.Plain Language Summary Humans generate vast quantities of bioavailable nitrogen for agricultural production, and much of the excess ends up in rivers and streams. As the nitrogen flows downstream, some of it is naturally removed by streambed sediments through a process known as hyporheic exchange. In this paper, we set out to answer the question: how does the movement of groundwater into (or out of) a stream affect the removal of nitrogen by hyporheic exchange? Multiscale and multi-physics model simulations suggest that groundwater movement across the streambed can shut down the physical and biological processes that remove stream nitrogen. Hence, stream-groundwater interactions may play an important role in modulating the human and environmental impacts of nitrogen pollution.Show less"
29,"Cranswick, RH",Jul 1 2015 ,"Scales and magnitude of hyporheic, river-aquifer and bank storage exchange fluxes",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Many studies have investigated the exchange processes that occur between rivers and groundwater systems and have successfully quantified the water fluxes involved. Specifically, these exchange processes include hyporheic exchange, river-aquifer exchange (groundwater discharge and river loss) and bank storage exchange. Remarkably, there are relatively few examples of field studies where more than one exchange process is quantified, and as a consequence, the relationships between them are not well understood. To compare the relative magnitudes of these common exchange processes, we have collected data from 54 studies that have quantified one or more of these exchange flux types. Each flux value is plotted against river discharge at the time of measurement to allow the different exchange flux types to be compared. We show that there are positive relationships between the magnitude of each exchange flux type and increasing river discharge across the different studies. For every one order of magnitude increase in river discharge, the hyporheic, river-aquifer and bank storage exchange fluxes increase by factors of 2.7, 2.9 and 2.5, respectively. On average, hyporheic exchange fluxes are almost an order of magnitude greater than river-aquifer exchange fluxes, which are, in turn, approximately four times greater than bank storage exchange fluxes for the same river discharge. Unless measurement approaches that can distinguish between different types of exchange flux are used, there is potential for hyporheic exchange fluxes to be misinterpreted as river-aquifer exchange fluxes, with possible implications for water resource management decisions.

30,"Surfleet, C",Nov 2018 ,The Influence of Hyporheic Exchange on Water Temperatures in a Headwater Stream,WATER,"A headwater stream in coastal California was used to evaluate the temperature response of effective shade reduction. Spatial distribution of stream water temperatures for summer low-flow conditions (<0.006 m(3) s(-1)) were highly correlated with net radiation and advective heat transfers from hyporheic exchange and subsequent streambed conduction. Using a heat budget model, mean maximum stream water temperatures were predicted to increase by 1.7 to 2.2 degrees C for 50% and 0% effective shade scenarios, respectively, at the downstream end of a 300 m treatment reach. Effects on mean maximum stream water temperature changes, as water flowed downstream through a 500 m shaded reach below the treatment reach, were reduced by 52 to 30% from the expected maximum temperature increases under the 50% and 0% effective shade scenarios, respectively. Maximum stream water temperature change predicted by net radiation heating alone was greater than measured and heat-budget-estimated temperatures. When the influence of hyporheic water exchange was combined with net radiation predictions, predicted temperatures were similar to measured and heat-budget-predicted temperatures. Results indicate that advective heat transfers associated with hyporheic exchange can promote downstream cooling following stream water temperature increases from shade reduction in a headwater stream with cascade, step-pool, and large woody debris forced-pool morphology.Show less"

Previous numerical simulation and experimental studies have shown that hyporheic exchange can be affected not only by current but also by geometric characteristics of the streambed. However, the geometric characteristics that affect hyporheic exchange remain unclear. In this study, a one-way sequential coupling method was established to connect the river water flow and pore-water flow in the streambed. The change of flux at the interface, mass flux, depth, and area of hyporheic zone were investigated by altering the bed geometric characteristics, i.e. the depth, crest position, and shapes of bedforms. The results clearly demonstrate the following conclusions: (a) the hyporheic exchange flux, depth and area with wave-like bedform is greater than the triangular bedform. (b) The increase of the bed height accelerates the hyporheic exchange processes at the sediment-water interface. (c) A good linear relationship was found between the depth and area of the hyporheic zone. These results provide necessary theoretical understandings of hyporheic ex-change, broadening the knowledge of mechanism of stream-streambed exchange processes.Show less"
33,"Cheng, DD",Jul 2019 ,Influences of riverbed morphology on patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange within a natural river confluence,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"River confluences are pivotal junctions that have vital influences on hydraulic characteristics and sediment particle distributions as well as on hyporheic water exchange. However, hyporheic water exchange is poorly understood because of the complicated river morphology within a river confluence. Therefore, the river confluence between the Juehe River and Haohe River located in arid and semi-arid areas of northwestern China was selected to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange processes, and the temperatures of different depth sediment were measured on July 11th and 12th, 2016 by an instrument equipped with five temperature sensors. The patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange were estimated using a one-dimensional heat transport model coupled with temperature data. Meanwhile, terrain points elevations and sediment particle distributions in this river confluence were collected to determine the confluence riverbed morphology. Furthermore, the river confluence morphology effects on hyporheic water exchange were investigated in this study. The different riverbed morphology and hydrodynamic zone locations were observed, which were controlled by the planform geometry with low river confluence flux momentum during the test period. Meanwhile, the upwelling flow dominated in the test area, and the downwelling occurred at three of the 23 total test points, which was induced by the complicated riverbed morphology and hydraulic characteristics. Additionally, the magnitudes of the upwelling flow were significantly influenced by the sediment heterogeneity subjected to the erosional and depositional processes. Hyporheic water exchange is a vital hydrological process in arid and semi-arid areas, where it significantly impacts the ecological environment of rivers. This study provides a valuable guideline for water quality and quantity management in arid and semi-arid areas.Show less"
34,"Lin, QD",Feb 2020 ,"Effect of Hyporheic Exchange on MacroinvertebrateCommunity in the Weihe River Basin, China",WATER,"The effect of hyporheic exchange on macroinvertebrates is a significant topic in ecohydraulics. A field study was conducted during May and June 2017 to investigate the impacts of magnitude and patterns of hyporheic exchange on the sediment macroinvertebrate community in the Weihe River basin. The results demonstrate that upwelling flows cause resuspension of riverbed sediment, increasing the proportion of swimmer groups (such as Baetidae) in the macroinvertebrate community. However, large resuspension of river bed sediment results in a reduced abundance of macroinvertebrates. By controlling the transport processes of dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients, temperature, and different patterns of hyporheic exchange strongly influence the structure of macroinvertebrate communities. Downwelling is more likely to produce rich invertebrate communities than upwelling. The magnitude for the hyporheic flux of 150-200 mm/d was optimal for the macroinvertebrate community in the Weihe River Basin. Above or below this rate results in a decline in community abundance and diversity. We suggest that research is conducted to better understand the effects of hyporheic exchange across bedforms on macroinvertebrate communities. The study supports any activities to preserve the ecological functions and health of rivers dominated by fine-grained sediments.Show less"
35,"Ward, AS",Nov 2010 ,Characterizing hyporheic transport processes - Interpretation of electrical geophysical data in coupled stream-hyporheic zone systems during solute tracer studies,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Quantifying hyporheic solute dynamics has been limited by our ability to assess the magnitude and extent of stream interactions with multiple domains: mobile subsurface storage (MSS, e.g., freely flowing pore water) and immobile subsurface storage (ISS, e.g., poorly connected pore water). Stream-tracer experiments coupled with solute transport modeling are frequently used to characterize lumped MSS and ISS dynamics, but are limited by the ability to sample only ""mobile"" water and by window of detection issues. Here, we couple simulations of near-surface electrical resistivity (ER) methods with conservative solute transport to directly compare solute transport with ER interpretations, and to determine the ability of ER to predict spatial and temporal trends of solute distribution and transport in stream-hyporheic systems. Results show that temporal moments from both ER and solute transport data are well correlated for locations where advection is not the dominant solute transport process. Mean arrival time and variance are especially well-predicted by ER interpretation, providing the potential to estimate rate-limited mass transport (i.e. diffusive) parameters from these data in a distributed domain, substantially increasing our knowledge of the fate and transport of subsurface solutes.

36,"Caruso, A",Aug 2016 ,Impact of watershed topography on hyporheic exchange,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Among the interactions between surface water bodies and aquifers, hyporheic exchange has been recognized as a key process for nutrient cycling and contaminant transport. Even though hyporheic exchange is strongly controlled by groundwater discharge, our understanding of the impact of the regional groundwater flow on hyporheic fluxes is still limited because of the complexity arising from the multi-scale nature of these interactions. In this work, we investigate the role of watershed topography on river-aquifer interactions by way of a semi-analytical model, in which the landscape topography is used to approximate the groundwater head distribution. The analysis of a case study shows how the complex topographic structure is the direct cause of a substantial spatial variability of the aquifer-river exchange. Groundwater upwelling along the river corridor is estimated and its influence on the hyporheic zone is discussed. In particular, the fragmentation of the hyporeic corridor induced by groundwater discharge at the basin scale is highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
37,"Liao, ZJ",Jun 2013 ,Modeling and inverting reactive stream tracers undergoing two-site sorption and decay in the hyporheic zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Performing stream-tracer experiments is an accepted technique to assess transport characteristics of streams undergoing hyporheic exchange. Recently, combining conservative and reactive tracers, in which the latter presumably undergoes degradation exclusively within the hyporheic zone, has been suggested to study in-stream transport, hyporheic exchange, and the metabolic activity of the hyporheic zone. The combined quantitative analysis to adequately describe such tests, however, has been missing. In this paper, we present mathematical methods to jointly analyze breakthrough curves of a conservative tracer (fluorescein), a linearly degrading tracer (resazurin), and its daughter compound (resorufin), which are synchronously introduced into the stream as pulses. In-stream transport is described by the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation, amended with a convolution term to account for transient storage within the hyporheic zone over a distribution of travel times, transformation of the reactive tracer in the hyporheic zone, and two-site sorption of the parent and daughter compounds therein. We use a shape-free approach of describing the hyporheic travel-time distribution, overcoming the difficulty of identifying the best functional parameterization for transient storage. We discuss how this model can be fitted to the breakthrough curves of all three compounds and demonstrate the method by an application to a tracer test in the third-order stream Goldersbach in Southern Germany. The entire river water passes once through the hyporheic zone over a travel distance of about 200 m with mean hyporheic residence times ranging between 16 and 23 min. We also observed a secondary peak in the transfer functions at about 1 h indicating a second hyporheic flow path. We could jointly fit the breakthrough curves of all compounds in three monitoring stations and evaluated the parameter uncertainty of the individual and joint fits by a method based on conditional realizations of the hyporheic travel-time distribution. The approach gives insight into in-stream transport, hyporheic exchange, metabolic activity, and river-bed sorption of the stream under investigation.Show less"

However, the relationship between the design parameters of river structure and solute transport is still poorly understood. In this study, we combined flume experiments and numerical simulations to systematically evaluate how in-stream structures impact the solute transport depth (D-P), hyporheic vertical exchange flux (Q), and solute flux (Qs). The results showed that the in-stream structure had a significant influence on solute transport in the HZ and could obviously increase the intensity of hyporheic exchange and promote solute transport. Model results indicated that D-P, Q, and Qs increased with the ratio of ground height to underground height of structure (H/D) and structure number (N), while Q, D-P, and Qs increased with the structural spacing (S) to begin with; then, Q remained constant, and D-P and Qs decreased as S continued to increase. This study deepened our understanding of the influence of in-stream structural design parameters on HZ solute transport, which is helpful to provide a theoretical basis for ecological restoration projects in the river HZ.Show less"

The penetration of stream water into the subsurface was analysed using hydrometric data, and the zone of > 10% stream water was calculated from a chemical mixing equation using tracer injection of bromide and background chloride concentrations. The constructed riffles studied induced more extensive hyporheic exchange than the natural riffles because of their steeper longitudinal hydraulic head gradients and coarser streambed sediments. The depth of > 10% stream water zone in a small and a large constructed riffle extended to > 0.2 m and > 1.4 m depths respectively. Flux and residence time distribution of hyporheic exchange were simulated in constructed riffles using MODFLOW, a finite-difference groundwater flow model. Hyporheic flux and residence time distribution varied along the riffles, and the exchange occurring upstream from the riffle crest was small in flux and had a long residence time. In contrast, hyporheic exchange occurring downstream from the riffle crest had a relatively short residence time and accounted for 83% and 70% of total hyporheic exchange flow in a small and large riffle respectively. Although stream restoration projects have not considered the hyporheic zone, our data indicate that constructed riffles and steps can promote vertical hydrologic exchange and increase the groundwater-surface water linkage in degraded lowland streams.

40,"Chow, R",Jul 2021 ,How Do Fractures Influence Hyporheic Exchange in Sedimentary Rock Riverbeds?,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bedrock rivers represent a hydrogeological environment in which surface water flows along an exposed bedrock surface. Studies of hyporheic exchange have exclusively involved rivers composed of unconsolidated fluvial sediments, leaving a critical knowledge gap. This study evaluates the conditions that could support bedform-scale hyporheic exchange within a fractured sedimentary bedrock river based on field data collected near Guelph, Canada. Hyporheic exchange at the bedform-scale was evaluated by numerically modeling the migration of a conservative solute tracer through a bedrock riverbed within a two-dimensional vertical cross-section along the flow direction. A stochastic discrete fracture-matrix framework was developed to represent measured subsurface fractured bedrock properties, producing a probabilistic distribution of potential hyporheic exchange pathways. Flow and transport model results indicate that: (a) bedform-scale hyporheic exchange within a bedrock river exists with high fluid flow velocities in fractures, yet long solute residence times due to diffusion across the fracture-matrix boundary; (b) the coincidence of fractures and hydrodynamic head gradients across the riverbed controls the spatial extent of bedform-scale hyporheic exchange; and (c) the potential variability in hyporheic exchange residence time is large (i.e., tens of years) due to the inherent variability in facture network properties. Our field-based numerical study indicates that the average (median) residence time may not be a good proxy for the potential natural attenuation capacity of a fractured sedimentary bedrock riverbed and that hyporheic exchange has the potential to emplace surface water contaminants within the fractured porous rock matrix that could become a long-term source of trace contaminants.Show less"
41,"Painter, SL",Feb 3 2021 ,On the Representation of Hyporheic Exchange in Models for Reactive Transport in Stream and River Corridors,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Efforts to include more detailed representations of biogeochemical processes in basin-scale water quality simulation tools face the challenge of how to tractably represent mass exchange between the flowing channels of streams and rivers and biogeochemical hotspots in the hyporheic zones. Multiscale models that use relatively coarse representations of the channel network with subgrid models for mass exchange and reactions in the hyporheic zone have started to emerge to address that challenge. Two such multiscale models are considered here, one based on a stochastic Lagrangian travel time representation of advective pumping and one on multirate diffusive exchange. The two models are formally equivalent to well-established integrodifferential representations for transport of non-reacting tracers in steady stream flow, which have been very successful in reproducing stream tracer tests. Despite that equivalence, the two models are based on very different model structures and produce significantly different results in reactive transport. In a simple denitrification example, denitrification is two to three times greater for the advection-based model because the multirate diffusive model has direct connections between the stream channel and transient storage zones and an assumption of mixing in the transient storage zones that prevent oxygen levels from dropping to the point where denitrification can progress uninhibited. By contrast, the advection-based model produces distinct redox zonation, allowing for denitrification to proceed uninhibited on part of the hyporheic flowpaths. These results demonstrate that conservative tracer tests alone are inadequate for constraining representation of mass transfer in models for reactive transport in streams and rivers.Show less"
42,"Bellin, A",Feb 2015 ,Breakthrough curve moments scaling in hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The interaction between stream flow and bed forms creates an uneven distribution of near-bed energy heads, which is the driving force of hyporheic exchange. Owing to the large disparity of advection characteristic times in the stream and within the hyporheic zone, solute mass exchange is often modeled by considering the latter as an immobile region. In a recent contribution Gonzalez-Pinzon et al. (2013) showed that existing models employing this hypothesis are structurally inconsistent with the scaling revealed by the analysis of 384 breakthrough curves collected in 44 streams across five continents. Motivated by this result, we analyze the scaling characteristics of a model that we recently developed by combining the analytical solution of the advective flow within the hyporheic zone with a Lagrangian solute transport model. Results show that similarly to the experimental data our model predicts breakthrough curves with a constant skewness, irrespective of the stream size, and that the scaling of the first three moments observed by Gonzalez-Pinzon et al. (2013) is also respected. Moreover, we propose regression curves that relate the first three moments of the residence time distribution with the alternate bar dimensionless depth (Y-BM(*)), a quantity that is easily measurable in the field. The connection between BTC moments and Y-BM(*) opens new possibilities for modeling transport processes at the catchment scale.Show less"
43,"STANFORD, JA",Mar 1993 ,AN ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE OF ALLUVIAL RIVERS - CONNECTIVITY AND THE HYPORHEIC CORRIDOR,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Floodplains of large alluvial rivers are often expansive and characterized by high volume hyporheic flow through lattice-like substrata, probably formed by glacial outwash or lateral migration of the river channel over long time periods. River water downwells into the floodplain at the upstream end; and, depending on bedrock geomorphology and other factors, groundwater from the unconfined aquifer upwells directly into the channel or into floodplain springbrooks at rates determined by head pressure of the water mass moving through the floodplain hydrologic system. These large scale (km3) hyporheic zones contain speciose food webs, including specialized insects with hypogean and epigean life history stages (amphibionts) and obligate groundwater species (stygobionts). Biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone may naturally load ground-waters with bioavailable solutes that appear to exert proximal controls on production and biodiversity of surface benthos and riparian vegetation. The effect is especially evident in floodplain springbrooks. Dynamic convergence of aquifer-riverine components adds physical heterogeneity and functional complexity to floodplain landscapes. Because reaches of aggraded alluvium and attendant ecotonal processes occur serially, like beads on a string, along the river continuum, we propose the concept of a hyporheic corridor in alluvial rivers. We expect predictable zonation of groundwater communities and other aquifer-riverine convergence properties within the corridor from headwaters to river mouth. The landscape-level significance and connectivity of processes along the hyporheic corridor must be better understood if river ecosystems, especially those involving large floodplain components, are to be protected and/or rehabilitated.Show less"
44,"Lee, DH",Aug 2014 ,Numerical modeling of bed form induced hyporheic exchange,PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT,"The hyporheic zone is a region beneath and alongside a stream, river, or lake bed where shallow groundwater and surface water mix. Field and experimental observations, along with modeling studies, indicate that hyporheic exchange occurs mainly in response to pressure gradients driven by the geomorphological features of stream beds. Flow over a pool-riffle sequence creates an irregular pressure gradient that drives hyporheic exchange. Currently to analyze the overall flow pattern in different types of pool-riffle structures, hyporheic exchange flow was analyzed using a fully coupled hydro-dynamic model. Simulation results showed that recirculation zones and stagnation points in the pool-riffle structures dominantly controlled the upwelling and downwelling patterns. Numerical simulations were analyzed for the velocity distribution, velocity vectors, and the streamline and flux of groundwater and surface water. Upwelling flow was dominated by a pressure gradient generated by the apex of riffles. Downwelling flow patterns were affected by the flow pattern formed in pools, which was related to the geometric shapes of the pools. The mixing pattern in the groundwater was also affected by the pool shape. The results will be applicable for river restoration projects and stream ecology related to hyporheic exchange, in the prediction and management of upwelling and downwelling flow induced by bed forms.Show less"

Owing to the limitations of instrumental detection at small spatial scales, previous studies have focused mainly on dune-induced hyporheic exchange in homogeneous systems. A low-permeability lens is a natural, widespread heterogeneity in stream beds, and probably affects the processes of water flow and contaminant transportation significantly. To quantitatively analyse the response mechanism of hyporheic exchange to a low-permeability lens, a two-dimensional dune-generated hyporheic exchange model was developed using the VS2DH model. The results indicate a lens in a stream bed can hinder or enhance hyporheic exchange processes, depending on its relative spatial location to dunes. Both the increase in length and thickness of the lens could strengthen its impacts on hyporheic exchange. Regional groundwater-surface water interactions of higher intensity suppress the flow of hyporheic exchange in a stream bed with a low-permeability lens.Show less"
46,"Winnick, MJ",Dec 2021 ,Stream Transport and Substrate Controls on Nitrous Oxide Yields From Hyporheic Zone Denitrification,AGU ADVANCES,"Rivers and streams act as globally significant sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere, in part through denitrification reactions that will increase in response to ongoing anthropogenic nitrogen loading. While many factors that contribute to the release of N2O relative to inert dinitrogen (N-2) are well described, the ability to predict N2O yields from streams remains a fundamental challenge. Here, I revisit results from the second Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiments (LINX II) in the context of turbulent hyporheic exchange. Denitrification efficiency, or the fraction of nitrate delivered to the streambed by stream turbulence that is chemically reduced, emerges as the single best predictor of N2O yields and underpins the first statistically significant models of inter-site N2O yields. This mechanistic connection is supported by reactive transport modeling of hyporheic zone denitrification representing advective flowpaths, flowpath mixing, and diffusion-dominated anoxic microzones. Simulated N2O yields are inversely correlated with denitrification efficiency; however, advective models are unable to capture low LINX II N2O yields at low denitrification efficiencies. Hyporheic zone mixing exacerbates this inability to capture observed N2O yields via the promotion of N2O release from fast, oxic flowpaths. Instead, anoxic microzones are required to account for LINX II observations through consistently low N2O yields and the consumption of upstream-produced N2O. Together, these results provide a framework for controls on stream N2O yields and suggest that stream corridor restoration designs aimed at increasing the capacity of hyporheic zones to remediate nitrate loading, as opposed to increasing hyporheic exchange, will also reduce proportional N2O emissions.Show less"

Hyporheic respiration also varies temporally as a result of flash floods which scour and remove algae from the stream and thus reduce the pool of organic matter to support subsurface metabolism. Nitrification was also significantly affected by flooding; nitrification increased from an average of only 3.0 mu gNO(3)-N . L sediments(-1). h(-1) immediately following floods to 38.5 mu gNO(3)-N . L sediments(-1). h(-1) late in succession. Nitrification was significantly correlated with hyporheic respiration, supporting the hypothesis that nitrification is fueled by mineralization of organic nitrogen to ammonium. The coupling between subsurface respiration and nitrification is one step in a cyclic interaction between surface and hyporheic zones and serves to transform nitrogen from an organic to inorganic form.Show less"
48,"Bourke, SA",Nov 27 2014 ,Characterisation of hyporheic exchange in a losing stream using radon-222,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hyporheic and parafluvial flows between streams and the underlying streambed, or adjacent alluvium, are important drivers of biogeochemical cycling in streams. Here we present a new method for characterising this exchange in a losing stream based on longitudinal stream radon activities. A mass balance approach is used to constrain the radon influx into the stream and estimate exchange parameters: flux, residence time and exchange zone thickness. A net radon flux into the stream of 5.4 x 10(4) Bq m(-1) d(-1) is required to balance radon losses to groundwater recharge, gas transfer and radioactive decay. Given the radon production rate of the sediments (1.3 +/- 0.7 Bq L-1 d(-1)), the minimum volume of alluvium flushed by either hyporheic or parafluvial exchange is 168 m(3) per m length of stream. Based on the stream width, depth of alluvial sediments and porosity, this implies that the exchange zone extends beneath the stream and an additional 11 m either side. The results of this new method are compared to two existing methods; streambed radon disequilibrium and transient storage modelling of breakthrough curves of an injected tracer. The stream radon mass balance provides a relatively simple means of estimating hyporheic (and parafluvial) exchange over tens to hundreds of kilometres of stream. Concurrent application of the stream radon method, transient storage modelling of injected tracer breakthrough curves and hydraulic methods is recommended to capture the full spectrum of hyporheic exchange in losing streams.

49,"Siergieiev, D",2014 ,Hyporheic water exchange in a large hydropower-regulated boreal river - directions and rates,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,"Widespread river regulation is known to modify river-aquifer interactions, influencing entire watersheds, but knowledge of the hyporheic flowpath along regulated rivers is limited. This study measured the hydraulic conductivity of the river bed and the aquifer, water levels and seepage fluxes in the heavily regulated Lule River in Northern Sweden, with the aim of characterising water exchange across the river-aquifer interface. While pristine rivers in the area are gaining, the Lule River was recharging the aquifer during 10% of the time. Daily river level fluctuations (typically +/- 0.25 m) directed similar to 3% of the total orthogonal flux across the river bed towards the aquifer, while during similar to 2% of the time the orthogonal fluxes were negligible (<= 10(-4) m d(-1)). A clogging layer on the river bed, most likely formed due to the modified river discharge, restricted river-aquifer exchange. The hyporheic zone had higher electrical conductivity than the river and the aquifer and electrical conductivity occasionally decreased following rising river water levels, with 3-5 hours' delay. Overall, hydropower regulation has severely altered the hydrological regime of the hyporheic zone in the Lule River.Show less"
