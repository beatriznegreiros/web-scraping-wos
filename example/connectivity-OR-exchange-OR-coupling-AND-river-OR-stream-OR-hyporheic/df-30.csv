We review methods for prioritizing barriers for removal and report on a survey asking practitioners which barrier prioritization methods they use. Opportunities for barrier removal depend to a large extent on barrier typology, as this dictates where barriers are normally located, their size, age, condition, and likely impacts. Crucially, river fragmentation depends chiefly on the number and location of barriers, not on barrier size, while the costs of barrier removal typically increase with barrier height. Acting on many small barriers will often be more cost-efficient than acting on fewer larger structures. Barriers are not randomly distributed and a small proportion of barriers have a disproportionately high impact on fragmentation, therefore targeting these 'fragmentizers' can result in substantial gains in connectivity. Barrier prioritization methods can be grouped into six main types depending on whether they are reactive or proactive, whether they are applied at local or larger spatial scales, and whether they employ an informal or a formal approach. While mathematical optimization sets the gold standard for barrier prioritization, a hybrid approach that explicitly considers uncertainties and opportunities is likely to be the most effective. The effectiveness of barrier removal can be compromised by inaccurate stream networks, erroneous barrier coordinates, and underestimation of barrier numbers. Such uncertainties can be overcomeby ground truthing via river walkovers and predictive modelling, but the cost of collecting additional information must be weighed against the cost of inaction. To increase the success of barrier removal projects, we recommend that barriers considered for removal fulfill four conditions: (1) their removal will bring about a meaningful gain in connectivity; (2) they are cost-effective to remove; (3) they will not cause significant or lasting environmental damage, and (4) they are obsolete structures. Mapping barrier removal projects according to the three axes of opportunities, costs, and gains can help locate any 'low hanging fruit.'Show less"
1,"Sheldon, F",Feb 2006 ,Relationships between flow variability and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition: Data from four Australian dryland rivers,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Australian dryland rivers have distinctive ecologies, intimately linked to their variable flows. The contrasting states of flood and drought mean that dryland rivers fluctuate between being highly connected (during floods: low fragmentation) to being highly disconnected (during droughts: high fragmentation) with the degree of connection between waterbodies on a spatial scale and the time since last connection on a temporal scale strongly influencing community composition. Flow regulation reduces the frequency and duration of flooding, thereby decreasing flow variability and imposing stable low flow conditions and high connectivity between waterbodies. Using macroinvertebrate assemblage data from four Australian dryland rivers (River Murray, Darling River, Cooper Creek and Diamantina River), we calculated various indices of flow variability from 30-year hydrographs and assessed how well long-term flow variability, and therefore variable levels of habitat connection, could explain broad patterns of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Where hydrological connection between sites was strong (River Murray pool sites) there was extreme similarity between assemblages at each site. Also, for sites where hydrological disconnection was extreme there was similarity between assemblages. There were strong associations between the complex measures of flow variability and the assemblage composition of the four rivers, suggesting that flow variability, and therefore, variable levels of habitat connectivity, may be strong determinants of broad-scale assemblage composition in dryland rivers.

2,"Zhao, L",Jun 2020 ,"Assessing Hydrological Connectivity Mitigated by Reservoirs, Vegetation Cover, and Climate in Yan River Watershed on the Loess Plateau, China: The Network Approach",WATER,"Hydrologic connectivity is related to the water-mediated transport of matter, energy, and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. It reflects the hydrological consequences caused by topographic, land cover, and climatic factors, and is an important tool to characterize and predict the hydrological responses to climate and landscape change. In the Loess Plateau region, a large number of reservoirs have been constructed to trap sediment and storage water for drinking, irrigation, and industries. The land cover has been significantly reshaped in the past decades. These changes may alter the watershed hydrological connectivity. In this study, we mapped the spatial pattern of hydrological connectivity with consideration of reservoir impedances, mitigation of climate, and land cover in the Yan River watershed on the Loess Plateau by using the network index (NI) approach that is based on topographical wetness index. Three wetness indices were used, i.e., topographical wetness index (TWI), SAGA (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses) wetness index (WIS), and wetness index adopted aridity index (AI) determined by precipitation and evapotranspiration (WIPE). In addition, the effective catchment area (ECA) was also employed to reveal the connectivity of reservoirs and river networks to water source areas. Results show thatECAof reservoirs and rivers account for 35% and 65%, respectively; the hydrological connectivity to the reservoir was lower than that to the river networks. The normalized hydrological connectivity revealed that the connectivity to river channels maintained the same distribution pattern but with a decreased range after construction of reservoirs. As revealed by comparing the spatial patterns of hydrological connectivity quantified byNIbased onWI(S)andWI(PE)respectively, vegetation cover patterns had significantly alternated watershed hydrological connectivity. These results imply a decreased volume of flow in river channels after reservoir construction, but with same temporal period of flow dynamic. It is illustrated that the network index (NI) is suitable to quantify the hydrological connectivity and it is dynamic in the context of human intervention and climate change.Show less"

The current study addresses the variations in hyporheic zone (HZ) characteristics in alternate bars due to different streamflow, ambient groundwater, and sediment anisotropy. Several simulations, using a sequentially coupled surface water-groundwater model of a synthetic reach with fully developed alternate bars morphology, were performed. Two HZs exist within the streambed; a shallow zone that is more linked to surface water, and a deep one that is more influenced by the groundwater variations. Increasing streamflow, and therefore bar submergence, decreases the hyporheic flow. The residence times distribution is bimodal, which implies the existence of two HZs. This bimodality is enhanced by anisotropic sediment conditions, while it is much milder in isotropic ones. The shallow zone residence times increase when streamflow value rises, while the residence times in the deep HZ are less affected. The mean and median residence times decrease by increasing streamflow in partially submerged case, and they are larger in fully submerged case. The hyporheic flow, area, residence times, and extent decrease by increasing groundwater fluxes. The deep zone is the most affected by the groundwater fluxes. Hyporheic flow and extent values are significantly larger in isotropic conditions than in anisotropic ones. The change in residence times values is different between the deep and shallow zones. A predictive model is driven to predict the hyporheic flux, residence times, and hyporheic depths dependence on bar submergence, ambient groundwater, and sediment anisotropy.Show less"
4,"Siebers, AR",Feb 26 2020 ,Diel cycles of delta C-13(DIC) and ecosystem metabolism in ephemeral dryland streams,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Streams in hot, arid environments often exist as a series of isolated pools along main channels. During these periods, shallow alluvial through flow may strongly influence key ecological processes within pools. We measured diel changes in delta C-13 values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in two pools of ephemeral, dryland streams. We quantified alluvial water connectivity through stable isotope analysis (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of pool and alluvial water. We also estimated gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates across a wider set of pools in both streams. delta C-13(DIC) values displayed regular diel cycles, where both pools displayed small but similar daily amplitude (0.7-0.9 parts per thousand) despite contrasting amplitudes of change in DO (0.8 mg L-1 vs. 2.8 mg L-1) and contrasting alluvial water connectivity (connected vs. disconnected). Water temperature was the strongest predictor of both delta C-13(DIC) values and rates of change in delta C-13(DIC) across both pools. Across both streams, all pools were net heterotrophic. GPP (0.35-1.73 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) and ER (0.49-2.64 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) rates were linked to aquatic vegetation cover. The disconnect between diurnal amplitudes of delta C-13 values and DO concentrations thus suggests that ecological drivers of gas exchange became increasingly localised as pools contracted.Show less"
5,"Lavelle, AM",Aug 2021 ,Effects of Habitat Restoration on Fish Communities in Urban Streams,WATER,"Geomorphological alterations, hydrological disconnectivity and water pollution are among the dominant pressures affecting ecological integrity in urban streams. River restoration approaches often involve utilising in-stream structures to encourage flow heterogeneity and promote habitat diversity. However, few studies examine the success of such projects. In this study, fish density, biomass and community structure at paired restored and unrestored reaches across five tributaries of the River Thames were examined. Fish density varied among rivers and reaches but was generally higher at restored sites. Restored sites also exhibited higher overall fish biomass, attributed mainly to the presence of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) at the River Wandle. Despite higher density and biomass values at restored sites, the community structure analysis did not identify strong links between either river or restoration status using either species-specific density or biomass. Our results highlight that although reach-scale restoration can lead to localised increases in species density and biomass, this may chiefly be due to aggregation owing to preferential habitats created through restoration activities at these sites. Over larger spatial scales, significant improvements to species richness and diversity are likely to be limited due to the poor water quality and disconnected nature of these urban streams. Whilst reach-scale restoration clearly has the potential to provide preferential habitats for fish species, future efforts should focus on improving connectivity for fish across the wider Thames basin network by removing barriers to passage, improving water quality, restoring watershed processes and creating well-connected, diverse habitats which can facilitate the survival of a wide array of fish species throughout their life cycle.Show less"
6,"Thellman, A",Sep 2021 ,The Ecology of River Ice,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Many of the world's rivers are ice-covered during winter months but increasing evidence indicates that the extent of river ice will shift substantially as winters warm. However, our knowledge of rivers during winter lags far behind that of the growing season, limiting our understanding of how ice loss will affect rivers. Physical, chemical, and biological processes change from headwaters to large rivers; thus, we expect ice processes and resulting effects on the ecology of rivers could also vary with river size, as a result of the associated changes in geomorphology, temperature regimes, and connectivity. To conceptualize these relationships, we review typically disparate literature on ice processes and winter ecology and compare what is known in the smallest and largest rivers. In doing so, we show that our ability to link ice with ecology across river networks is made difficult by a primary focus on ice processes in larger rivers and a lack of study of ecosystem processes during winter. To address some of these gaps, we provide new scenarios of river ice loss and analyses of how the annual importance of winter gross primary productivity (GPP) varies with river size. We show projected ice loss varied with large-scale watershed characteristics such as north-south orientation and that the importance of winter to annual GPP was greatest in the smallest rivers. Finally, we highlight information needed to fill knowledge gaps on winter across river networks and improve our understanding of how rivers may change as climate and ice regimes shift.Show less"
7,"Villalobos, ME",Apr 15 2005 ,Reduced functional connectivity between V1 and inferior frontal cortex associated with visuomotor performance in autism,NEUROIMAGE,"Some recent evidence has suggested abnormalities of the dorsal stream and possibly the mirror neuron system in autism, which may be responsible for impairments of joint attention, imitation, and secondarily for language delays. The current study investigates functional connectivity along the dorsal stream in autism, examining interregional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal cross-correlation during visuomotor coordination. Eight high-functioning autistic men and eight handedness and age-matched controls were included. Visually prompted button presses were performed with the preferred hand. For each subject, functional connectivity was computed in terms of BOLD signal correlation with the mean time series in bilateral visual area 17. Our hypothesis of reduced dorsal stream connectivity in autism was only in part confirmed. Functional connectivity with superior parietal areas was not significantly reduced. However, the autism group showed significantly reduced connectivity with bilateral inferior frontal area 44, which is compatible with the hypothesis of mirror neuron defects in autism. More generally, our findings suggest that dorsal stream connectivity in autism may not be fully functional. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Show less"
8,"Pereda, O",2017 ,"Effects of aeration, sediment grain size and burial on stream litter breakdown and consumer performance: a microcosm study",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"Turbulence and aeration are reduced in many streams during low-flow periods as a consequence of drought or water abstraction, thus affecting invertebrate interactions and pivotal ecosystem processes such as the breakdown of organic matter (OM). These effects can be larger in the hyporheic zone (HZ), the ecotone connecting the surface stream and groundwater, especially when fine sediments reduce hydraulic conductivity. In addition, OM breakdown in the HZ could depend on the availability of OM in the benthic zone (BZ), because the latter would not only be a more accessible, and thus preferred, food resource, but also more easily scoured downstream. In a laboratory microcosm experiment of 28 days duration, we manipulated aeration, sediment size and location of OM (either all buried or half buried with half on the surface, simulating the HZ and BZ respectively). Six mayfly (Habroleptoides) individuals and four stonefly (Capnioneura) individuals were enclosed in each microcosm and the consumption of OM was measured. Lack of aeration reduced oxygen saturation from 94 to 66%, reducing OM consumption particularly on the surface, in contrast with our expectations. As hypothesised, the availability of surface OM significantly reduced invertebrate consumption of buried OM. Habroleptoides performed better than Capnioneura, especially in fine sediments. The results suggest that reduced turbulence can affect invertebrate trophic interactions as well as the decomposition of OM, depending on sediment grain size and the location of OM.Show less"
9,"Ravazzani, G",Jun 2016 ,Assessing Groundwater Contribution to Streamflow of a Large Alpine River with Heat Tracer Methods and Hydrological Modelling,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The contribution of groundwater to streamflow in Alpine catchments is still poorly understood, despite the fact that it may heavily impact hydrological balance and stream habitats. This paper presents the results of a field campaign based on experiments with heat tracer methods to assess the hyporheic flow during the low-flow period of a large Alpine river in Italy. These measurements were employed to validate a distributed hydrological model that can be used to asses river-groundwater interaction in both low-flow and high-flow conditions. The results show that groundwater may have a relevant role during low-flow periods, by increasing river discharge and during floods, by subtracting direct run-off that is stored in river banks.

10,"Tockner, K",Jan 2010 ,Multiple stressors in coupled river-floodplain ecosystems,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Riverine floodplains are highly complex, dynamic and diverse ecosystems. At the same time they are among the world's most threatened ecosystems because of the pervasiveness of dams, levees and other factors such as rapid spreading of non-native species. Hence, floodplains are ideal systems to study ecological impacts of multiple stressors at the local, regional and catchment scale.2. Concepts such as the subsidy-stress hypothesis and the stress-induced community tolerance concept have been formulated to study the effect of stressors on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as on their functional linkages.3. Riverine floodplains are pulsed ecosystems with distinct flow, sediment, resource and thermal pulses - thereby creating distinct 'windows of ecological opportunity'. Human modifications that truncate or amplify theses pulses will have cascading effects on river-floodplain interactions by shifting the thresholds of connectivity, resilience or resistance - causing drastic regime shifts.4. Most aquatic insects and pond-breeding amphibians have complex life cycles with aquatic and terrestrial stages. They are exposed to different stressors in their aquatic and terrestrial realm. Because most life history functions of aquatic insects are restricted to a short terrestrial period, we need to fully integrate the 'airscape' into the future management of river-floodplain ecosystems.5. Riverine floodplains integrate and accumulate multiple stressors at the catchment level, as reflected by distinct catchment fingerprints. Based on the European Catchment Data Base we provide spatially explicit information on multiple stressors; a key prerequisite for setting priorities in conservation and management planning.6. Thematic implications: the management of stressed river and floodplain ecosystems is a major challenge for the near future and water managers worldwide. Management approaches need to be adaptive and embedded within a catchment-wide concept to cope with upcoming pressures originating from global change.Show less"

12,"Hao, WL",Aug 2019 ,Spatiotemporal distilled dense-connectivity network for video action recognition,PATTERN RECOGNITION,"Two-stream convolutional neural networks show great promise for action recognition tasks. However, most two-stream based approaches train the appearance and motion subnetworks independently, which may lead to the decline in performance due to the lack of interactions among two streams. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Spatiotemporal Distilled Dense-Connectivity Network (STDDCN) for video action recognition. This network implements both knowledge distillation and dense-connectivity (adapted from DenseNet). Using this STDDCN architecture, we aim to explore interaction strategies between appearance and motion streams along different hierarchies. Specifically, block-level dense connections between appearance and motion pathways enable spatiotemporal interaction at the feature representation layers. Moreover, knowledge distillation among two streams (each treated as a student) and their last fusion (treated as teacher) allows both streams to interact at the high level layers. The special architecture of STDDCN allows it to gradually obtain effective hierarchical spatiotemporal features. Moreover, it can be trained end-to-end. Finally, numerous ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalization of our model on two benchmark datasets, including UCF101 and HMDB51. Simultaneously, our model achieves promising performances. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
13,"Elmer, S",Nov 2017 ,Functional connectivity in the dorsal stream and between bilateral auditory-related cortical areas differentially contribute to speech decoding depending on spectro-temporal signal integrity and performance,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,"Speech processing relies on the interdependence between auditory perception, sensorimotor integration, and verbal memory functions. Functional and structural connectivity between bilateral auditory-related cortical areas (ARCAs) facilitates spectro-temporal analyses, whereas the dynamic interplay between ARCAs and Broca's area (i.e., dorsal pathway) contributes to verbal memory functions, articulation, and sound-to-motor mapping. However, it remains unclear whether these two neural circuits are preferentially driven by spectral or temporal acoustic information, and whether their recruitment is predictive of speech perception performance and learning. Therefore, we evaluated EEG-based intracranial (eLORETA) functional connectivity (lagged coherence) in both pathways (i.e., between bilateral ARCAs and in the dorsal stream) while good- (GPs, N = 12) and poor performers (PPs, N = 13) learned to decode natural pseudowords (CLEAN) or comparable items (speech-noise chimeras) manipulated in the envelope (ENV) or in the fine-structure (FS). Learning to decode degraded speech was generally associated with increased functional connectivity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency range in both circuits. Furthermore, GPs exhibited increased connectivity in the left dorsal stream compared to PPs, but only during the FS condition and in the theta frequency band. These results suggest that both pathways contribute to the decoding of spectro-temporal degraded speech by increasing the communication between brain regions involved in perceptual analyses and verbal memory functions. Otherwise, the left-hemispheric recruitment of the dorsal stream in GPs during the FS condition points to a contribution of this pathway to articulatory based memory processes that are dependent on the temporal integrity of the speech signal. These results enable to better comprehend the neural circuits underlying word-learning as a function of temporal and spectral signal integrity and performance.Show less"
14,"Perkin, JS",May 24 2013 ,Simulating fish dispersal in stream networks fragmented by multiple road crossings,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Organisms inhabiting stream ecosystems are vulnerable to the effects of habitat fragmentation because of the inherent hierarchical structure of patches in riverscapes. Fragmentation caused by road-stream crossings contributes to alteration of stream organism distribution globally. We used principles of graph theory to develop three artificial riverscapes and test for network-scale changes in simulated fish dispersal caused by barriers that resembled the properties of road-stream crossings (semi-permeable; numerous within a network). Fish occupancy of nodes (habitat patches) declined in the presence of a single barrier when barrier permeability was <0.5, and fish with high dispersal experienced greater declines in occupancy compared to fish with low dispersal. Probability of extirpation (emigration without return) from fragments was greatest for nodes that mimicked headwater stream segments. We used a network-scale measure of habitat connectivity (the dendritic connectivity index; DCI) to measure changes in occupancy across all nodes and found the DCI predicted declines in occupancy as the number of barriers in the riverscape increased. Declines in occupancy were driven by threshold responses by fish to the occurrence of small fragments (<= 3 nodes). Our simulations identified three important properties of stream fish dispersal that are likely relevant to natural systems: (i) species dispersal affinities determine response to fragmentation; (ii) fragments that are too ""small"" for organism persistence drive declines in riverscape occupancy; and (iii) measurements of structural (habitat) connectivity used to draw inference on functional (population) connectivity require knowledge of organism dispersal affinity and dispersal-mediated response to barrier positioning.

15,"Shamsuddin, MKN",Feb 2019 ,"Vertical hydraulic conductivity of riverbank and hyporheic zone sediment at Muda River riverbank filtration site, Malaysia",APPLIED WATER SCIENCE,"In analysing the stream-aquifer interactions and riverbank filtration (RBF) systems, it is very crucial to determine the vertical riverbank and streambed hydraulic conductivity. The riverbank and streambed focused in this investigation are a riverbank of six layers with depths of 38m and streambed with depths of 9m connected layers of sediments at 22 test locations and 4 test wells in the Muda River, Malaysia. In the analysis, there were a few tests involved to determine riverbank and hydraulic conductivity of vertical streambed, such as analysis of grain size, pumping test and in situ falling head standpipe permeability tests. The approximate K values of 114 samples and 15 samples taken from riverbanks and streambeds, respectively, were then calculated by employing empirical equation methods [Hazen, Hazen K (cm/s)=d10 (mm), Terzaghi, Beyer, Slichter, Sauerbrei, Kruger, Kozeny-Carman, Zunker, USBR, Zamarin, Barr, Alyamani and Sen, Chapuis, and Krumbein and Monk]. The geometric mean of K for six layers, namely the sandy silt (8.30m/day), silty sand (47.66m/day), gravelly sand (150.24m/day), sandy gravel layer (418.48m/day), gravelly sand (151.09m/day) and silty clay (9.36m/day) as identified characteristics by using grain-size analyses, was greater than the K of pumping test (geometric mean) (31.10m/day) and the mean obtained from K of permeability tests (7.03m/day). In general, the K values of upper layer of sediments of streambed were recorded to be larger in comparison with their respective lower layer of sediments. The K value for the upper layer of sediments from all tests located at the left, right and middle parts of the river ranged from 7.56 to 54.77m/day for upper layer, from 39.80 to 128.40m/day for middle layer and from 9.11 to 49.92m/day for lower layer, as described by the grain-size analysis. The value of K ranges based on permeability test indicated that the value of K was from 0.036 to 1.09m/day for the upper layer and 0.16 to 0.68m/day for the lower layer of hyporheic sediments zone. Based on the acquired results, the conclusion that the aquifer of the focused area shows possibility for RBF and has the potential to improve the water quality and quantity is referable.Show less"
16,"Duarte, G",Mar 20 2021 ,Damn those damn dams: Fluvial longitudinal connectivity impairment for European diadromous fish throughout the 20th century,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River longitudinal connectivity is crucial for diadromous fish species to reproduce and grow, its fragmentation by large dams may prevent these species to complete their life cycle. This work aims to evaluate the impact of large dams on the structural longitudinal connectivity at the European scale, from a Diadromous fish species perspective, since the beginning of the 20th century until the early 21st century. Based on large dam locations and completion year, a multitude of river impairment metrics were calculated at three spatial scales for six European oceanic regions and 12 time periods. The number of basins affected by large dams is overall low (0.4%), but for large river basins, that cover 78% of Europe's area, 69.5% of all basins, 55.4% of the sub-basins and 68.4% of river length are impaired. River network connectivity impairment became increasingly significant during the second half of the 20th century and is nowadays spatially widespread across Europe. Except for the North Atlantic, all oceanic regions have over 50% of impacted river length. Considering large river basins, the Mediterranean (95.2%) and West Atlantic (84.6%) regions are the most affected, while the Black (92.1%) and Caspian (96.0%) regions stand out as those with most compromised river length. In 60 years, Europe has gone from reduced impairment to over two-thirds of its large rivers with structural connectivity problems due to large dams. The number of such barriers increased significantly in the second half of the 20th century, especially main stem dams with decreasing distance to the river mouth. Currently, the structural longitudinal connectivity of European river networks is severely impacted. This concerns all regions considered, and those in southern Europe will face even higher challenges, given that this will be a future hot spot for hydropower development and predictably more affected by climate change.

17,"He, RY",May-jun 2018 ,Cross-Shelf Exchange Associated With the Gulf Stream in the South Atlantic Bight: Direct Observations Using an Autonomous Underwater Glider,MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL,"An autonomous underwater glider was deployed in March 2014 to sample the Gulf Stream and its adjacent shelf waters in the South Atlantic Bight, providing a new look at cross-shelf exchange associated with Gulf Stream dynamics. Observations collected over 4 weeks reveal significant cross-shelf exchange (up to 0.5 Sv) at the shoreward edge of the Gulf Stream, which was 2 orders of magnitude larger than estimates from long-term mean hydrographic conditions. Gulf Stream frontal eddies may have contributed to some of the largest fluxes of heat (0.5 degrees C Sv) and salt (0.03 Sv g/kg) onto the shelf. We estimate that the largest upwelling event during the mission could have brought nitrate concentrations over 20 pM to within 125 m of the surface. This study demonstrates clear capabilities of autonomous underwater gliders for sampling in and near fast moving boundary currents to obtain unique and critical in situ observations effectively.Show less"
18,"Masese, FO",Jan 2017 ,Influence of catchment land use and seasonality on dissolved organic matter composition and ecosystem metabolism in headwater streams of a Kenyan river,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Headwater streams influence the biogeochemical characteristics of large rivers and play important roles in regional and global carbon budgets. The combined effects of seasonality and land use change on the biogeochemistry of headwater streams, however, are not well understood. In this study we assessed the influence of catchment land use and seasonality on the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ecosystem metabolism in headwater streams of a Kenyan river. Fifty sites in 34 streams draining a gradient of catchment land use from 100% natural forest to 100% agriculture were sampled to determine temporal and spatial variation in DOM composition. Gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were determined in 10 streams draining primarily forest or agricultural catchments. Absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometry of DOM reflected notable shifts in composition along the land use gradient and with season. During the dry season, forest streams contained higher molecular weight and terrestrially derived DOM, whereas agricultural streams were dominated by autochthonous production and low molecular weight DOM. During the rainy season, aromaticity and high molecular weight DOM increased in agricultural streams, coinciding with seasonal erosion of soils and inputs of organic matter from farmlands. Most of the streams were heterotrophic. However, GPP and ER were generally greater in agricultural streams, driven by higher dissolved nutrient (mainly TDN) concentrations, light availability (open canopy) and temperature compared with forest streams. There were correlations between freshly and autochthonously produced DOM, GPP and ER during both the dry and wet seasons. This is one of the few studies to link land-use with organic carbon dynamics and DOM composition. Measures of ecosystem metabolism in these streams help to affirm the role of tropical streams and rivers as important components of the global carbon cycle and demonstrate that even semi-intensive, smallholder agriculture can have measurable effects on riverine ecosystem functioning.Show less"
19,"Kulessa, B",Aug 15 2003 ,Cross-coupled flow modeling of coincident streaming and electrochemical potentials and application to subglacial self-potential data,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH,"This study aims to demonstrate that self-potential measurements can yield unique information about subglacial drainage conditions, which has so far been doubtful. At the bed of warm-based glaciers arborescent and distributed drainage systems interact, and streaming and electrochemical potentials coincide. A key secondary aim of this study is, therefore, the development of a mathematical framework for the analysis of self-potentials generated by such interacting flow systems. We consider cross coupling between hydraulic, electrical, and chemical driving forces, and apply the resulting model solution to self-potential data recorded beneath Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland. We find that (1) the streaming and electrochemical contributions to the total self-potential signal can be separated mathematically, (2) streaming potentials directly reflect the direction of water flow at the glacier bed, (3) combination of streaming potentials with hydraulic conductivity estimates from slug tests allows estimation of in situ subglacial water flow velocities, (4) the subglacial zeta potential, calculated from estimated values of the streaming coupling coefficient, is small (similar to-0.022 V) due to systematic flushing of clay minerals from the channel area during the melt season, and (5) uncertainties in exact electrode location in the borehole are unlikely to produce self-potential noise. Self-potential measurements may therefore yield unique information about subglacial drainage conditions, and especially the direction and velocity of in situ subglacial water flow are difficult to obtain by other methods. We further anticipate that our mathematical framework will be applicable to other areas of subsurface hydrology, especially where spatially distributed seepage feeds preferential flow pathways.Show less"
20,"Nekouee, N",Dec 2015 ,A Coupled Empirical-Numerical Model for a Buoyant River Plume in Lake Michigan,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"A coupling technique is developed to predict the behavior of a buoyant river plume in a lake. The model incorporates a 3D hydrodynamic model (POMGL) and a 3D particle tracking model (Partic3D) for the far-field transport computations. The source conditions for the particle tracking model are obtained from a near-field model derived from the characteristics of the plume analyzed from extensive field studies on the Grand River plume, Lake Michigan. The empirical near-field model was developed to predict the geometry of the plume, dilution, and centerline trajectory near the river mouth, and to provide the concentration and location of the particles to be released in the far field. The coupled empirical-numerical model shows improved predictions in the near field versus the single numerical model. The present results strongly advocate the use of model combinations in order to improve coastal diffusion and transport processes. The primary application of the technique is in recreational water early-warning and forecasting systems that will estimate the immediate and short-term risk of exceeding pathogen indicator concentration criteria in lakes and coastal areas.Show less"
21,"Harrington, RA",Feb 2016 ,Aquatic insect -diversity is not dependent on elevation in Southern Rocky Mountain streams,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Relatively high -diversity among aquatic insect communities inhabiting high-elevation streams is most commonly presumed to result from increased dispersal limitation between isolated mountaintop islands'. However, these elevational patterns of -diversity have been predominately drawn from observed changes in community composition along single-thread channels, where the downstream increase in habitat size and hydrologic connectivity provides potential alternative explanations.2. In this study, we applied an alternative conceptual tributary model' to ask whether patterns of aquatic insect -diversity in similar-sized, hydrologically disconnected streams showed a similar elevational gradient in diversity patterns as previously reported for conceptual mainstem model' studies. Aquatic insects were sampled from 24 low-order, montane streams that are tributaries to larger rivers in three adjacent catchments spanning c. 2000-3500m in elevation. We used relative abundance data to quantify two types of -diversity: (i) community turnover-, or the change in local diversity among adjacent streams along the elevational gradient within each catchment, and (ii) community variation-, or the change in local diversity among all streams within three elevation zones combined across catchments.3. Our results provided evidence of no relationship between -diversity and elevation in aquatic insect communities in small montane streams. Community turnover- was found to be consistently high among sites within catchments and displayed no significant trend across the elevational gradient for any catchment. Community variation- showed a nonlinear response to elevation, with sites in the high-elevation and low-elevation zones having similarly high community variation- compared to sites in the mid-elevation zone.4. Our tributary model' results provide the first evidence that -diversity among small, isolated streams can have similar turnover rates across broad elevational gradients. Our results also show similar patterns of -diversity among low- and high-elevation tributaries, suggesting that dispersal limitation is not restricted to high-elevation streams.Show less"
22,"Morrice, JA",Mar 15 1997 ,"Alluvial characteristics, groundwater-surface water exchange and hydrological retention in headwater streams",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Conservative solute injections were conducted in three first-order montane streams of different geological composition to assess the influence of parent lithology and alluvial characteristics on the hydrological retention of nutrients. Three study sites were established: (1) Aspen Creek, in a sandstone-siltstone catchment with a fine-grained alluvium of low hydraulic conductivity (1.3 x 10(-4) cm/s), (2) Rio Calaveras, which flows through volcanic tuff with alluvium of intermediate grain size and hydraulic conductivity (1.2 x 10(-3) cm/s), and (3) Gallina Creek, located in a granite/gneiss catchment of coarse, poorly sorted alluvium with high hydraulic conductivity (4.1 x 10(-3) cm/s). All sites were instrumented with networks of shallow groundwater wells to monitor interstitial solute transport. The rate and extent of groundwater-surface water exchange, determined by the solute response in wells, increased with increasing hydraulic conductivity. The direction of surface water-groundwater interaction within a stream was related to local variation in vertical and horizontal hydraulic gradients. Experimental tracer responses in the surface stream were simulated with a one-dimensional solute transport model with inflow and storage components (OTIS). Model-derived measures of hydrological retention showed a corresponding increase with increasing hydraulic conductivity.To assess the temporal variability of hydrological retention, solute injection experiments were conducted in Gallina Creek under four seasonal flow regimes during which surface discharge ranged from baseflow (0.75 l/s in October) to high (75 l/s during spring snowmelt). Model-derived hydrological retention decreased with increasing discharge.The results of our intersite comparison suggest that hydrological retention is strongly influenced by the geologic setting and alluvial characteristics of the stream catchment. Temporal variation in hydrological retention at Gallina Creek is related to seasonal changes in discharge, highlighting the need for temporal resolution in studies of the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in stream ecosystems.

23,"Jenkins, KM",Oct 2003 ,Connectivity in a dryland river: Short-term aquatic microinvertebrate recruitment following floodplain inundation,ECOLOGY,"Periodic hydrological connectivity among fragmented floodplain habitats governs the persistence of aquatic biota. In dryland rivers, unpredictable flooding interspersed with low flows and drying drive their ""boom and bust"" ecology. During drying, aquatic habitats contract and fragment. Flooding connects and expands habitats, triggering productivity booms in waterbirds, fish, and plants. Microinvertebrates form the base of the food web and also flourish after floods, but their colonization pathways remain unknown. To determine the relative contribution of flood water-transported propagules vs. emergence of in situ resting stages from inundated sediments, we studied short-term recruitment of microinvertebrates after flooding in the dryland Darling River, Australia. Lakes open to transported and emerging in situ micro invertebrates were compared with lake and laboratory microcosms closed to transported microinvertebrates. Floods imported most early colonists to floodplain lakes. In situ emergence from sediments was less important until weeks later but potentially sustained production over a longer period of inundation. Some taxa primarily colonized lakes via emergence whereas others were only transported to lakes. A spatially nested ANOVA approach spanning patches within lakes to among reaches revealed contrasting variability across hierarchical scales for taxonomic richness and densities of microinvertebrate taxa. This was most marked at the reach scale, possibly reflecting seasonal patterns in flooding. Microinvertebrate colonization sequences in the Darling River floodplain rely on connectivity between habitats during flooding. Ecological connectivity was greater at small spatial scales (patches within lakes 100-1000 m, among lakes 10(4)-10(5) m) than at larger spatial scales (reaches 10(5)-10(6) m). The strength of connectivity is likely to vary across spatial scales with the magnitude, duration, and rate of rise and fall of floods.Show less"

In forecasting models, groyne fields are represented as dead zones with effective properties like exchange coefficients and exchanging volume. Despite its relevance for such practical applications, little research has been done on the exchange process between a groyne field and the main stream itself. Therefore, this study is aimed at examining this exchange process and validating the dead-zone prediction model, which treats the exchange process as a first order system. A schematized physical model of a river with groynes was built in a laboratory flume. The exchange process was visualized quantitatively with dye in, adjacent groyne fields. In order to couple the exchange process to the velocity field, particle tracking velocimetry measurements were performed. Two different types of exchange were observed. First, exchange takes place via the mixing layer that is formed at the river-groyne-field interface. The large eddies formed in the mixing layer are the major cause of this exchange. Second, under certain conditions, even larger eddies are shed from the upstream groyne tip. Distortions in the flow field caused by such intermittent structures cause a much larger exchange than that by the mixing layer alone. The occurrence of large shed eddies depends on the presence of a sufficiently large, stationary, secondary gyre located at the upstream corner of the groyne field. The overall exchange of matter could be characterized as a first-order process, in accordance with the dead-zone-theory. The corresponding exchange coefficients agreed reasonably well with the results of earlier experiments and the effective coefficients as found in experiments in real river flows.Show less"

Hydraulic exchange at a riffle-pool sequence in the Lahn River, Germany, was analyzed using HEC-RAS to simulate the surface water flow as a boundary for the subsurface flow and MODFLOW, MODPATH, and MT3DMS to reproduce the transport in the subsurface. Solute transport and residence times of surface water in the subsurface were simulated after calibrating sediment properties to fit simulated hydraulic head to measured subsurface head from the riffle-pool pair. Three surface water flow rates were considered. Results indicated that exchange increases with increasing surface water flow. However, the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed sediments influences the mass transfer more than the surface water flow. The ratio of the infiltration rate to the surface water flow is of the same order of magnitude for all the considered flow conditions. Residence times of surface water in the subsurface varied inversely with the flow rates in the river.Show less"
27,"Ashworth, PJ",Aug 2012 ,How do big rivers come to be different?,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,"Big rivers dominate the world's continental surface, yet we are still learning about how they operate and whether they are explicably different, not only from each other, but also from smaller rivers. This paper uses global satellite imagery and ground field-experience to explain and illustrate why and how big rivers are strongly differentiated.At the largest scale, trans-continent sized rivers do not possess unified valley systems created by fluvial erosion but instead involve chains of interlinked domains with contrasted fluvial functions. Alluvial settings are dependent on mainstream and tributary inputs of water and sediment but big river channel pattern variety is determined by contrasts in sediment feed-rates and differences in the rates and routes of sediment exchange. Four modes of alluvial exchange are recognised: (i) deposition on the floodplain (e.g., levees, infilled palaeochannels and floodbasins), (ii) exchanges involving main channels (e.g., bank erosion and accretion), (iii) deposition within main channels (e.g. bedforms from metres to 10s of kilometres in size), and (iv) material input from tributaries (sediment-rich or sediment-poor). Different combinations of sedimentation activity lead to floodplain morphologies for big rivers that can be classified into four types: (i) lacustrine-dominated, (ii) mainstream-dominated, (iii) tributary or accessory-stream dominated, and (iv) confined or bedrock-dominated.Channel patterning involves a range of main-channel, branch and floodplain styles promoted by variable sediment feeds, complex bed sediment transfers, variable lateral sediment exchanges, plural channel systems and incomplete mineral sedimentation of the hydraulic corridors set by tectonics and prior-valley trenching. In some of the world's largest rivers it is accessory and tributary channels, rather than main-river branches, which determine patterns of floodplain morphology. In some big rivers, but certainly not all, ponded lacustrine environments are common, with water bodies that vary from smaller water-filled swales and palaeochannels, to floodbasins and km-scale linear lakes in sediment-dammed tributaries. Organic sedimentation is significant along relatively sediment-poor and laterally-stable large rivers that fail to fill their alluvial corridors. Three case studies are used to illustrate this variability in big river pattern and process: the Ob, Jamuna and Parana. These rivers are respectively dominated by meandering, braiding and mixed mainstream and accessory channel morphologies.Big rivers have some processes and patterns that are different from smaller rivers including: (i) no simple down-valley sequence in control variables and channel pattern, (ii) main channels with high width:depth ratios. (iii) few or no channel-wide unit bars migrating through the main thalwegs, (iv) extensive and low-gradient floodplains that provide space for channel shifting and floodplain sedimentation, (v) long distances between significant tributaries to allow full mixing of water and sediment discharges, (vi) in some places, partially-decoupled channels and floodplains, and (vii) significant floodplain water bodies that readily act as sinks for fine-grained sediment where this is supplied, or organic deposition.Although understanding of contemporary big river patterns requires attention to a range of timescales, including inheritance from sediments of Quaternary age. big rivers do have a distinctive character. The variety of patterns on big rivers may usefully be viewed in terms of sediment systems operating at both the catchment and reach scales. Intra-river variability and internal complexity show the need to understand contrasted sediment supply, through-put and alluvial exchange as determinants of big river morphology and pattern.

28,"Hester, ET",Dec 1 2020 ,"Abundance, distribution, and geometry of naturally occurring streambank soil pipes",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The near-stream groundwater environment is a unique ecotone composed of the hyporheic zone and riparian/floodplain groundwater. Preferential flow paths through sediments are areas of substantially higher permeability than surrounding media. Macropores and soil pipes are a type of preferential flow path where conduit-like voids occur in soil as a result of biological and physical processes. Recent papers show that soil pipes exist in streambanks and have the potential to enhance the exchange of water and solutes between the channel and riparian groundwater. However, these prior streambank studies were confined to isolated locations, hence we do not know if streambank soil pipes are a limited or widespread phenomenon. Here we quantified the abundance, distribution, and geometry of naturally occurring streambank soil pipes >1.0 cm in diameter in 20 streams across 5 physiographic provinces in the eastern United States. We found 998 streambank soil pipes across all 20 streams, demonstrating their ubiquity in the region. Pipe openings were, on average, 4.0 cm wide, 3.4 cm high, spaced 2.2 m apart, and 26.0 cm above baseflow water surface elevation (WSEL) in the channel. Most pipes were above baseflow WSEL, with only 5.7% below. Pipes were more abundant in fine-grained soils, which generally have higher cohesivity and lower hydraulic conductivity. Soil pipes were more abundant in 3 of the 5 physiographic provinces, likely because of greater presence of fine-grained soils. At a smaller scale, streambanks with greater longitudinal heterogeneity of soil texture often had greater spatial heterogeneity of pipe density. However, given the effort required to characterize a relatively small number of streams, and because stream order and soil texture are related to physiographic province, it was not possible to statistically test the effect of these factors. This work represents the first attempt to characterize streambank soil pipe abundance and distribution across a range of stream orders and physiographic provinces. The ubiquity of soil pipes in the region implies their effect on bidirectional hyporheic exchange is likely equally widespread. These results may have water-quality implications, where streambank soil pipes could enhance hyporheic exchange but reduce the filtering capacity of riparian buffer zones.Show less"
29,"King, KBS",Apr 2021 ,Surface water connectivity affects lake and stream fish species richness and composition,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Stream and lake fishes are important economic and recreational resources that respond to alterations in their surrounding watersheds and serve as indicators of ecological stressors on aquatic ecosystems. Research suggests that fish species diversity is largely influenced by surface water connectivity, or the lack thereof; however, few studies consider freshwater connections and their effect on both lake and stream fish communities across broad spatial extents. We used fish data from 559 lakes and 854 streams from the midwestern-northeastern United States to examine the role of surface water connectivity on fish species richness and community composition. We found that although lakes and streams share many species, connectivity had a positive effect on species richness across lakes and streams and helped explain species composition. Taking an integrated approach that includes both lake and stream fish communities and connectivity among freshwaters helps inform scientific understanding of what drives variation in fish species diversity at broad spatial scales and can help managers who are faced with planning for state-, regional-, or national-scale monitoring and restoration.Show less"
30,"Pechenick, AM",Sep 15 2014 ,A multi-scale statistical approach to assess the effects of connectivity of road and stream networks on geomorphic channel condition,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Roads in rural, upland landscapes are important sources of runoff and sediment to waterways. The downstream effects of these sources should be related to the connectivity of roads to receiving waters. Recent studies have explored this idea, but only simple metrics have been used to characterize connectivity and few studies have quantified the downstream effects of road-stream connectivity on sediment or solute budgets and channel morphology. In this study, we evaluated traditional and newly developed connectivity metrics that utilized features of landscape position and delivery pathway to characterize road-stream connectivity in upland settings. Using data on stream geomorphic conditions developed by the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (Montpelier, VT), we related road connectivity metrics to channel condition on a set of 101 forested, upland streams with minimal development other than predominantly gravel road networks. Logistic regression indicated that measures of road density, proximity and orientation successfully distinguished among categories of stream geomorphic condition at multiple geographic scales. Discriminant function analysis using a set of inherent channel characteristics combined with road connectivity metrics derived at the reach corridor scale successfully distinguished channel condition for over 70% of the channels evaluated. This research contributes to efforts to evaluate the cumulative downstream effects of roads on stream channels and aquatic resources and provides a new means of watershed assessment to derive metrics that can be used to predict channel condition.

Through intensive monitoring using a combination of hydrochemical and biological analyses of the riparian GW and SW in the Liuxi River basin, China, the spatial-temporal patterns and extent of GW-SW interactions were qualitatively and quantitatively identified. The similarity of dynamic changes in the river water and GW levels reflected the hydrological connectivity between the river water and riparian GW. The discontinuity of the concentration in the majority of water chemistry parameters delineated the GW-SW interaction chemical boundaries as being within a distance of 2 and 0.5 m from the river in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The GW in the GW-SW interaction zone was characterized as having lower levels of dissolved oxygen and nitrate, moderate levels of electrical conductivity and major ions, and higher total organic carbon values. The percentage of river water in riparian GW increased with the proximity to the river from 9.0 to 68.8% in the wet season (WS) to 6.0-23.1% in the dry season (DS). The extent of GW-SW interactions was quantitatively identified by the chloride mass balance to be within 2 and 0.5 m from the river in the WS and DS, respectively. Based on the one-dimensional numerical particle tracking method, the exchange width of river water and GW was calculated to be 0.52 m in the DS as well. The analyses of microbial data demonstrated that GW samples within a distance of 2 m in the WS and 0.5 m in the DS exhibited a unique microbial community structure that contained a mixture of microbial components in the river water and background GW, indicative of the GW-SW mixing. The GW-SW interaction microbial boundaries were consistent with the chemical boundaries in both seasons. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of an integrated approach combining hydrochemical data and microbial community structure for the determination of GW-SW interactions.Show less"
32,"Cook, PG",Oct 11 2006 ,"Quantifying groundwater discharge to Cockburn River, southeastern Australia, using dissolved gas tracers Rn-222 and SF6",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Groundwater discharge to the Cockburn River, southeast Australia, has been estimated from comparison of natural Rn-222 activities in groundwater and river water, interpreted using a numerical flow model that simulates longitudinal radon activities as a function of groundwater inflow, hyporheic exchange, evaporation, gas exchange with the atmosphere, and radioactive decay. An injection of SF6 into the river to estimate the gas transfer velocity assisted in constraining the model. Previous estimates of groundwater inflow using Rn-222 activities have not considered possible input of radon due to exchange between river water and water in the hyporheic zone beneath the streambed. In this paper, radon input due to hyporheic exchange is estimated from measurements of radon production by hyporheic zone sediments and rates of water exchange between the river and the hyporheic zone. Total groundwater inflow to the Cockburn River is estimated to be 18500 m(3)/d, although failure to consider hyporheic exchange would cause overestimation of the volume of groundwater inflow by approximately 70%.Show less"
33,"Bezgin, G",Aug 2014 ,Auditory-prefrontal axonal connectivity in the macaque cortex: Quantitative assessment of processing streams,BRAIN AND LANGUAGE,"Primate sensory systems subserve complex neurocomputational functions. Consequently, these systems are organised anatomically in a distributed fashion, commonly linking areas to form specialised processing streams. Each stream is related to a specific function, as evidenced from studies of the visual cortex, which features rather prominent segregation into spatial and non-spatial domains. It has been hypothesised that other sensory systems, including auditory, are organised in a similar way on the cortical level. Recent studies offer rich qualitative evidence for the dual stream hypothesis. Here we provide a new paradigm to quantitatively uncover these patterns in the auditory system, based on an analysis of multiple anatomical studies using multivariate techniques. As a test case, we also apply our assessment techniques to more ubiquitously-explored visual system. Importantly, the introduced framework opens the possibility for these techniques to be applied to other neural systems featuring a dichotomised organisation, such as language or music perception.

34,"Harvey, JW",Sep 2003 ,Predicting changes in hydrologic retention in an evolving semi-arid alluvial stream,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Hydrologic retention of solutes in hyporheic zones or other slowly moving waters of natural channels is thought to be a significant control on biogeochemical cycling and ecology of streams. To learn more about factors affecting hydrologic retention, we repeated stream-tracer injections for 5 years in a semi-arid alluvial stream (Pinal Creek, Ariz.) during a period when streamflow was decreasing, channel width increasing, and coverage of aquatic macrophytes expanding. Average stream velocity at Pinal Creek decreased from 0.8 to 0.2 m/s, average stream depth decreased from 0.09 to 0.04 m, and average channel width expanded from 3 to 13 in. Modeling of tracer experiments indicated that the hydrologic retention factor (R-h), a measure of the average time that solute spends in storage per unit length of downstream transport, increased from 0.02 to 8 s/m. At the same time the ratio of cross-sectional area of storage zones to main channel cross-sectional area (A(s)/A) increased from 0.2 to 0.8 m(2)/m(2) and average water residence time in storage zones (t(s)) increased from 5 to 24 min. Compared with published data from four other streams in the US, Pinal Creek experienced the greatest change in hydrologic retention for a given change in streamflow. The other streams differed from Pinal Creek in that they experienced a change in streamflow between tracer experiments without substantial geomorphic or vegetative adjustments. As a result, a regression of hydrologic retention on streamflow developed for the other streams underpredicted the measured increases in hydrologic retention at Pinal Creek. The increase in hydrologic retention at Pinal Creek was more accurately predicted when measurements of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor were used (either alone or in addition to streamflow) as a predictor variable. We conclude that relatively simple measurements of channel friction are useful for predicting the response of hydrologic retention in streams to major adjustments in channel morphology as well as changes in streamflow.

This review seeks to: (i) highlight the crucial role that vegetation's influence on the efficiency of clastic material fluxes (geomorphic connectivity) plays in defining mountain fluvial landscape's behavior; and (ii) identify key challenges which hinder progress in the understanding of this subject. To this end, a selective literature review is carried out to illustrate the pervasiveness of the plants' effects on geomorphic fluxes within channel networks (longitudinal connectivity), as well as between channels and the broader landscape (lateral connectivity). Taken together, the reviewed evidence lends support to the thesis that vegetation-connectivity linkages play a central role in regulating geomorphic behavior of mountain fluvial systems.

It is difficult to achieve effective performance by directly using these data for unsupervised clustering analysis of brain diseases. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a dual-stream encoder neural networks with spectral constraint framework for clustering the functional brain connectivity data. Specifically, we consider two different information while encoding the input data: (1) the information between the neighboring nodes, (2) the discriminative features, then design a spectral constraint module to guide the clustering of embedded nodes. The framework contains four modules, Graph Convolutional Encoder, Hard Assignment Optimization Network, Decoder module, and Spectral Constraint module. We train four modules jointly and implement a deep clustering network framework. We conducted experimental analysis on different public functional brain connectivity datasets for evaluating the proposed deep learning clustering model. Compared with the existing unsupervised clustering analysis methods for the brain connectivity data and related deep learning clustering methods, experiments on seven real brain connectivity datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed method.

Both 1D and 2D models are built using explicit upwind finite volume schemes, able to deal with wetting-drying fronts. The topography representation is described via cross sections for the 1D model and with quadrilateral/triangular structured/unstructured meshes for the 2D model. The coupling strategies, free of hydraulic structures and tuning parameters, are firstly validated in a laboratory test dealing with a levee break and its flooding into a lateral plane. The numerical results are compared with a fully 2D model as well as with measurements in some gauge points giving satisfactory results. The simulation of a real flooding scenario in the Tiber river near the urban area of Rome (Italy) is then performed. A lateral coupling configuration is provided, in which the flood wave propagation in the main channel is simulated by means of a 1D model and the inundation of the riverside is simulated by means of a 2D model. On the other hand, a frontal coupling, in which the flood wave is simulated in a 1D model first and then it is propagated into a 2D model, is also performed. The flooding extension is almost well captured by all the schemes presented, being the 1D-2D lateral configuration the most confident with speed-ups of around 15x. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Ephemeral streams flow here during the austral summer, transporting glacial meltwater to perennially ice-covered, closed basin lakes. The chemistry of 24 Taylor Valley streams was examined over the two-decade period of monitoring from 1993 to 2014, and the geochemical behavior of two streams of contrasting physical and biological character was monitored across the seven weeks of the 2010-2011 flow season. Four species dominate stream solute budgets: HCO3-, Ca2+, Na+, and Cl-, with SO42-, Mg2+, and K+ present in significantly lesser proportions. All streams contain dissolved silica at low concentrations. Across Taylor Valley, streams are characterized by their consistent anionic geochemical fingerprint of HCO3 > Cl > SO4, but there is a split in cation composition between 14 streams with Ca > Na > Mg > K and 10 streams with Na > Ca > Mg > K.Andersen Creek is a first-order proglacial stream representative of the 13 short streams that flow <1.5 km from source to gage. Von Guerard is representative of 11 long streams 2-7 km in length characterized by extensive hyporheic zones. Both streams exhibit a strong daily cycle for solute load, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, which vary in proportion to discharge. A well-expressed diurnal co-variation of pH with dissolved oxygen is observed for both streams that reflects different types of biological control. The relative consistency of Von Guerard composition over the summer flow season reflects chemostatic regulation, where water in transient storage introduced during times of high streamflow has an extended opportunity for water-sediment interaction, silicate mineral dissolution, and pore-water exchange.Show less"
39,"Bao, J",Nov 15 2018 ,Modulating factors of hydrologic exchanges in a large-scale river reach: Insights from three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hydrologic exchange is a critical mechanism that shapes hydrological and biogeochemical processes along a river corridor. Because of limitations in field accessibility, computational demand, and complexities of geomorphology and subsurface geology, full three-dimensional modelling studies to quantify hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) have been limited mostly to local-scale applications. At reach scales, although surface flow conditions and subsurface physical properties are well-known factors that modulate hydrologic exchanges, quantitative measures that can describe the effects of these factors on the strength and direction of such exchanges do not exist. To address this issue, we developed a one-way coupled surface and subsurface water flow model using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software STARCCM+ and applied it to simulate HEFs in a 7-km long reach along the main stem of the Columbia River in the United States. The model was validated against flow velocity measurements from an acoustic Doppler current profiler in the river, vertical HEFs estimated from a set of temperature profilers installed across the riverbed, and simulations from a reactive transport model. The validated model then was employed to systematically investigate how HEFs could be influenced by surface water fluid dynamics, subsurface structures, and hydrogeological properties. Our results suggest that reach-scale HEFs are dominated primarily by the thickness of the riverbed alluvium layer, and then by the alluvium permeability, the depth of the underlying impermeable layer, and the pressure boundary condition. Our results also elucidate the scale dependence of HEFs on fluid dynamics that can be captured only by three-dimensional CFD models. That is, while the net HEFs over the entire 7-km domain are not significantly influenced by surface water dynamics pressure, the dynamic pressure induced by fluid dynamics can lead to more than 15% in net HEFs for a river section of a few hundred metres.Show less"

The coupled model was applied to coastal ocean in the Philippines where terrestrial sediment loads provided from several adjacent watersheds play a major role in influencing coastal turbidity and are partly responsible for the coastal ecosystem degradation. The coupled model was validated using weather and hydrologic measurement to examine its potential applicability. The results revealed that the coastal water quality may be governed by the loads not only from the adjacent watershed but also from the distant watershed via coastal currents. This important feature of the multiple linkages can be quantitatively characterized by a ""stress connectivity matrix"", which indicates the complex underlying structure of environmental stresses in coastal ocean. The multiple stress connectivity concept shows the potential advantage of the integrated modelling approach for coastal ocean assessment, which may also serve for compensating the lack of measured data especially in tropical basins.

We ask the question whether such restorations improve freshwater biotic assemblages or functions over time, and if not, can general reasons be identified for such outcomes. We conducted a literature survey and review of studies in which different types of stream restorations were conducted and outcomes reported. These restoration types included culvert restoration; acid mine restoration or industrial pollutant restoration; urban stream restoration; dam removal, changes in dam operation, or fish passage structures; instream habitat modification; riparian restoration or woody material addition; channel restoration and multiple restorations. The streams ranged from headwater streams to large rivers, and the regions included North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and a small number of sites in Asia and Africa. In this part of the review, we describe the methods used for the review and present reviews for the first three types of stream restorations. For culvert restorations, the small sample size and variable study design and biotic responses limited generalizing about temporal and spatial scale effects for that restoration type. The complex and often lengthy time to restore streams from acid mine drainage and industrial pollutants often resulted in positive biotic responses, but restored sites had reduced responses compared with reference sites. Most urban stream restorations had minimal or mixed improvements in biotic responses, with one mismatch in spatial scale evidenced by hydraulic structures used in a restoration unable to withstand peak discharge.Show less"

The efficacy of leaf-litter decomposition, sediment respiration, biofilm biomass, growth, chlorophyll a concentration and the autotrophic index (biofilm ash-free dry mass/chlorophyll a) and fungal biomass for detecting human-induced change was evaluated using 24 references and 15 disturbed stream sites located in central Portugal.2. Decomposition rates of alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves and sediment respiration rates were effective in discriminating impairment. Decomposition was negatively correlated with abiotic factors, such as ammonium and nitrite concentrations, connectivity and alterations in the hydrological regime, and positively correlated with nitrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Sediment respiration rates were correlated with organic contamination, land use and morphological changes.3. Growth rates of biofilm, concentration of chlorophyll a and the autotrophic index, although 41-73% higher at disturbed compared to reference sites, were not significantly different. These three variables were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxygen concentration, pH, nitrite and the presence of dams. Fungal biomass on leaves and biofilm biomass on natural substrata did not differ between reference and disturbed sites.4. Our findings lend support to the use of functional variables like decomposition and sediment respiration in monitoring and when used together with structural variables should give a more holistic measure of stream health.Show less"
44,"Kornis, MS",Jul 2015 ,Fish community dynamics following dam removal in a fragmented agricultural stream,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Habitat fragmentation impedes dispersal of aquatic fauna, and barrier removal is increasingly used to increase stream network connectivity and facilitate fish dispersal. Improved understanding of fish community response to barrier removal is needed, especially in fragmented agricultural streams where numerous antiquated dams are likely destined for removal. We examined post-removal responses in two distinct fish communities formerly separated by a small aging mill dam. The dam was removed midway through the 6 year study, enabling passage for downstream fishes affiliated with a connected reservoir into previously inaccessible habitat, thus creating the potential for taxonomic homogenization between upstream and downstream communities. Both communities changed substantially post-removal. Two previously excluded species (white sucker, yellow perch) established substantial populations upstream of the former dam, contributing to a doubling of total fish biomass. Meanwhile, numerical density of pre-existing upstream fishes declined. Downstream, largemouth bass density was inversely correlated with prey fish density throughout the study, while post-removal declines in bluegill density coincided with cooler water temperature and increased suspended and benthic fine sediment. Upstream and downstream fish communities became more similar post-removal, represented by a shift in Bray-Curtis index from 14 to 41 % similarity. Our findings emphasize that barrier removal in highly fragmented stream networks can facilitate the unintended and possibly undesirable spread of species into headwater streams, including dispersal of species from remaining reservoirs. We suggest that knowledge of dispersal patterns for key piscivore and competitor species in both the target system and neighboring systems may help predict community outcomes following barrier removal.Show less"
45,"Sun, CG",Feb 2021 ,Investigation of Dynamic Coupling Coordination between Urbanization and the Eco-Environment-A Case Study in the Pearl River Delta Area,LAND,"The interaction between urbanization and the eco-environment is usually viewed as an effect-feedback framework. Its coupling system is composed of urbanization and eco-environment subsystems. In this paper, the coupling degree (CD) and the coupling coordinated degree (CCD) are used to reflect the coupling interaction and coupling coordination between the urbanization subsystem and the eco-environment subsystem. Based on the dynamic relative quantities of urbanization and eco-environment data in the Pearl River Delta, CD and CCD values were calculated, and the spatiotemporal evolution trend of coordination was analyzed. The results show that (1) from 2000 to 2015, the nine cities in the Pearl River Delta had high CD values and CCD values. Though they had different performances in different periods, they were all in a coordinated class, including good coordination (GC), moderate coordination (MC), and bare coordination (BC). (2) In terms of temporal evolution, the coupling coordination between urbanization and the eco-environment in the entire Pearl River Delta greatly improved. (3) From the perspective of spatial distribution, the coupling coordination of the central region was higher than that of the peripheral regions, and that of the west bank of the Pearl River was higher than that of the east bank of the Pearl River. These results can help local policy makers enact appropriate measures for sustainable development.Show less"
46,"Grant, SB",Dec 2020 ,A One-Dimensional Model for Turbulent Mixing in the Benthic Biolayer of Stream and Coastal Sediments,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In this paper, we develop and validate a rigorous modeling framework, based on Duhamel's Theorem, for the unsteady one-dimensional vertical transport of a solute across a flat sediment-water interface (SWI) and through the benthic biolayer of a turbulent stream. The modeling framework is novel in capturing the two-way coupling between evolving solute concentrations above and below the SWI and in allowing for a depth-varying diffusivity. Three diffusivity profiles within the sediment (constant, exponentially decaying, and a hybrid model) are evaluated against an extensive set of previously published laboratory measurements of turbulent mass transfer across the SWI. The exponential diffusivity profile best represents experimental observations and its reference diffusivity scales with the permeability Reynolds number, a dimensionless measure of turbulence at the SWI. The depth over which turbulence-enhanced diffusivity decays is of the order of centimeters and comparable to the thickness of the benthic biolayer. Thus, turbulent mixing across the SWI may serve as a universal transport mechanism, supplying the nutrient and energy fluxes needed to sustain microbial growth, and nutrient processing, in the benthic biolayer of stream and coastal sediments.Show less"
47,"Grill, G",Oct 2014 ,Development of new indicators to evaluate river fragmentation and flow regulation at large scales: A case study for the Mekong River Basin,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Large hydropower schemes have recently gained renewed interest as a provider of efficient and renewable energy, particularly in developing countries. However, some dams may have widespread effects on hydrological and ecosystem integrity, which reach beyond the scales addressed by typical environmental impact assessments. In this paper we address two main ecological impacts-reduced river connectivity and changes in the natural flow regime-at the scale of the entire Mekong River Basin as an important component of dam evaluations. The goal is to improve our understanding of the effect of individual dams as well as clusters of dams at a very large scale. We introduce two new indices, the River Connectivity Index (RCI) as a tool to measure network connectivity, and the River Regulation Index (RRI) as a measure of flow alteration, and calculate the individual and cumulative impact of 81 proposed dams using HydroROUT, a graph-theory based river routing model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how quantitative weighting, e.g. based on river habitat characterizations or species distribution models, may be included in dam impact assessments.A global comparison of large rivers shows that the Mekong would experience strong deterioration in the fragmentation and flow regulation indices if all dams that are currently under consideration in the basin were built, placing it among other heavily impounded rivers in the world. The results illustrate the importance of considering the location of dams, both relative in the network and relative to other already existing dams. Our approach may be used as an index-based ranking system for individual dams, or to compare basin-wide development scenarios, with the goal of providing guidance for decision makers wishing to select locations for future dams with less environmental impacts and to identify and develop potential mitigation strategies.

49,"Ren, JH",May 15 2004 ,Modeling of simultaneous exchange of colloids and sorbing contaminants between streams and streambeds,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Contaminant transport in streams can be significantly modified by both stream-subsurface exchange and the presence of colloidal particles, but the interaction of these effects is not well understood. Exchange with the hyporheic zone exposes Contaminants to surface-chemical reactions with streambed sediments, while colloidal particles have a large reactive surface area that allows them to carry pollutants that would otherwise be transported primarily as dissolved species. A new theoretical model is developed to predict the role of colloids in mediating advective contaminant exchange between streams and streambeds. Bedform-induced pumping theory is applied to model physical transport, and colloid filtration and reversible contaminant sorption are used to calculate the local distributions of colloids and contaminants within the streambed. Residence time functions of both colloids and contaminants in the bed are then used to link contaminant concentrations in the pore water and streamwater. Model simulations indicate that, under conditions of low colloid filtration and strong contaminant sorption to colloids, contaminants are mobilized by colloids and there is less retention of contaminants in the streambed. This is the case of ""colloid-facilitated contaminant transport"" commonly considered in groundwater transport. On the other hand, when colloid filtration is high and contaminants still sorb strongly to colloids, contaminant mobility decreases and there is greater contaminant retention in the streambed. We term this case ""colloid-impeded contaminant transport"". Thus, we find that a variety of contaminant transport behavior can occur depending on the concentration and mobility of suspended particles in the system and the relative affinity of contaminants for colloids and other solid phases.Show less"
