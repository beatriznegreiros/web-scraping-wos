The models were based on topographic surveys of the stream channel and surrounding floodplain, and surveyed water surface elevations (WSEs) were used to assign stream boundary conditions. Using the groundwater flow model, MODFLOW, and the particle tracking model, MODPATH, we calculated hyporheic exchange fluxes, their residence time distributions, and both longitudinal and plan view spatial patterns of downwelling and upwelling zones. In the first few years, streambed scour and sediment deposition smoothed the streambed and WSE profile, reducing HEF. Also, large contiguous patches of downwelling or upwelling were fragmented, nearly doubling the total number of patches present on the streambed. As the stream continued to adjust to the loss of wood, those trends began to reverse. Accretion of sediment onto alternating bars resulted in better developed pool-riffle morphology, enhanced HEF, and increased residence times and also resulted in downwelling and upwelling zones coalescing into elongated patches along bar margins. This study showed that the hyporheic zone is sensitive to changes in wood loading and that initial changes in HEF resulting from the direct effects of wood removal were contrary to longer-term channel adjustments to changes in wood loading.Show less"
1,"Klaar, MJ",Oct 2020 ,Instream wood increases riverbed temperature variability in a lowland sandy stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The (re)introduction of wood into rivers is becoming increasingly popular in river restoration and natural flood management schemes. While instream wood is known to promote geomorphic and hydraulic diversity, the impact of wood in driving surface water-streambed exchange and subsequent streambed temperatures remains under-researched, particularly in lowland rivers. We make use of the occurrence of three naturally occurring wood structures in a small, lowland sandy stream to determine how the presence of wood alters the geomorphic, hydraulic and thermal properties of the streambed. Our results show that instream wood plays an important role in promoting localized geomorphic complexity and thermal variation in the streambed. Locations within and immediately downstream of wood structures displayed the highest temperature range and daily variation. Locations upstream of wood structures were characterized by weaker daily temperature variation, while areas without wood displayed relatively stable streambed temperatures, with little diurnal fluctuation. Our study indicates that at this lowland site, instream wood increased seasonal temperature extremes (increased summer and decreased winter temperatures) at shallow depths by enhancing infiltration of warmer (summer) and colder (winter) surface water. This reduction in thermal buffering is likely to have significant implications to streambed-dwelling communities and highlights that the thermal impacts of wood reintroduction in lowland rivers should be considered prior to river restoration.Show less"
2,"Singley, JG",Oct 2022 ,Identification of hyporheic extent and functional zonation during seasonal streamflow recession by unsupervised clustering of time-lapse electrical resistivity models,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hyporheic exchange influences hydrologic transport and water quality through transient storage, which extends solute transit time, and leads to mixing of surface water and groundwater. Despite its importance, estimating the extent and spatiotemporal variability of the hyporheic zone remains challenging due to limitations in assessing the subsurface with discrete point-scale sampling. Analysis of time-lapse electrical resistivity (ER) data from tracer studies has shown potential to ameliorate such limitations. However, its utility in objectively delimiting hyporheic extent and quantifying changes in surface-groundwater exchange has been impeded by reliance on qualitative analysis of hyporheic extent or the use of a priori assumptions about data quality and signal strength. This study applies a novel unsupervised clustering method to time-lapse ER models derived from a benchmark dataset collected throughout baseflow recession in a mountain stream. We demonstrate that unsupervised clustering of inverted ER model time series can delimit hyporheic extent by distinguishing solute transport signals from noisy background inversions and identify functional zones defined by unique transport characteristics. We found that the structure of these zones was stable even as discharge changed by an order of magnitude, likely due to morphological constraints in this steep, narrow valley. Compared to traditional methods utilizing a priori thresholds to delimit hyporheic extent, clustering is robust to unintentional variations in tracer breakthrough curves that are typical of field-based studies. Therefore, clustering of inverted ER models represents a more robust and data-driven functional zonation representation of hyporheic exchange than has been possible with point-scale sampling or transport modelling, which usually assumes a single well-mixed hyporheic zone.Show less"
3,"Drummond, JD",Jan 2022 ,Microplastic accumulation in riverbed sediment via hyporheic exchange from headwaters to mainstems,SCIENCE ADVANCES,"In rivers, small and lightweight microplastics are transported downstream, but they are also found frequently in riverbed sediment, demonstrating long-term retention. To better understand microplastic dynamics in global rivers from headwaters to mainstems, we developed a model that includes hyporheic exchange processes, i.e., transport between surface water and riverbed sediment, where microplastic retention is facilitated. Our simulations indicate that the longest microplastic residence times occur in headwaters, the most abundant stream classification. In headwaters, residence times averaged 5 hours/km but increased to 7 years/km during low-flow conditions. Long-term accumulation for all stream classifications averaged similar to 5% of microplastic inputs per river kilometer. Our estimates isolated the impact of hyporheic exchange processes, which are known to influence dynamics of naturally occurring particles in streams, but rarely applied to microplastics. The identified mechanisms and time scales for small and lightweight microplastic accumulation in riverbed sediment reveal that these often-unaccounted components are likely a pollution legacy that is crucial to include in global assessments.Show less"
4,"Singh, T",Jan 2019 ,Dynamic Hyporheic Zones: Exploring the Role of Peak Flow Events on Bedform-Induced Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Discharge varies in space and time, driving hyporheic exchange processes in river corridors that affect biogeochemical cycling and ultimately control the dynamics of biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments. Herein, we use a reduced-order model to conduct the systematic analysis of the interplay between discharge variability (peak flow intensities, duration, and skewness) and streambed topography (bedform aspect ratios and channel slopes) and their role in the flow and transport characteristics of hyporheic zones (HZs). We use a simple and robust conceptualization of single peak flow events for a series of periodic sinusoidal bedforms. Using the model, we estimate the spatial extent of the HZ, the total amount of exchange, and the residence time of water and solutes within the reactive environment and its duration relative to typical time scales for oxygen consumption (i.e., a measure of the denitrification potential). Our results demonstrate that HZ expansion and contraction is controlled by events yet modulated by ambient groundwater flow. Even though the change in hyporheic exchange flux (%) relative to baseflow conditions is invariant for different values of channel slopes, absolute magnitudes varied substantially. Primarily, peak flow events cause more discharge of older water for the higher aspect ratios (i.e., for dunes and ripples) and lower channel slopes. Variations in residence times during peak flow events lead to the development of larger areas of potential nitrification and denitrification in the HZ for longer durations. These findings have potential implications for river management and restoration, particularly the need for (re)consideration of the importance of hyporheic exchange under dynamic flow conditions.Show less"
5,"De Smedt, F",Jun 10 2007 ,Analytical solution and analysis of solute transport in rivers affected by diffusive transfer in the hyporheic zone,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A model is presented for solute transport in rivers including transient storage in hyporheic zones. The model consists of an advection-clispersion equation for transport in the main channel with a sink term describing diffusive solute transfer to the hyporheic zone. This system of equations is solved analytically for instantaneous injection of a conservative tracer in an infinite uniform river reach with steady flow. The solution enables to estimate the temporal and spatial evolution of tracer concentrations downstream of the injection point with fewer parameters than any other model before. The solution is linked to a non-linear least squares optimisation algorithm to analyse breakthrough curves and estimate solute transport parameters. The model is applied to tracer experiments conducted in the Chittan River, Chile, which were previously analysed with a model including mass exchange between the river and a stagnant storage zone. The fit between observations and model results is good, except for some experiments where the tailing of the fitted curves is more pronounced than observed. Estimates of the water flow velocity are practically identical with previous findings, but the estimates of the cross-sectional area and the dispersion coefficient are markedly different. Estimated values for the diffusion coefficient in the hyporheic zone agree with values cited in literature and with the magnitude of chemical diffusion coefficients in porous media.

6,"Engelhardt, I",Mar 30 2011 ,Comparison of tracer methods to quantify hydrodynamic exchange within the hyporheic zone,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrodynamic exchange between surface-water and groundwater was studied at a river located within the Rhine Valley in Germany. Piezometric pressure heads and environmental tracers such as temperature, stable isotopes, chloride, X-ray contrast media, and artificial sweetener were investigated within the hyporheic zone and river water plume. Vertical profiles of environmental tracers were collected using multi-level wells within the neutral up-gradient zone, beneath the river bed, and within the horizontal proximal and distal down-gradient zone. infiltration velocities were calculated from pressure heads, temperature fluctuations and gradients. The amount of river water within groundwater was estimated from vertical profiles of chloride, stable isotopes, and persistent pharmaceuticals. Profiles of stable isotopes and chloride reveal the existence of down-welling within the shallow hyporheic zone that is generated by river bed irregularities. Due to down-welling an above-average migration of river water into the hyporheic zone establishes even under upward hydraulic pressure gradients. The investigated environmental tracers could not distinctively display short-time-infiltration velocities representative for flood waves, while average infiltration velocities calculated over several months are uniform displayed. Based on vertical temperature profiles the down-gradient migration of the river water plume could be observed even after long periods of effluent conditions and over a distance of 200 m from the river bank. X-ray contrast media and artificial sweeteners were observed in high concentrations within the proximal zone, but were not detected at a distance of 200 m from the river bank. Using temperature as environmental tracer within the hyporheic zone may result in overestimating the migration of pollutants within the river water plume as the process of natural attenuation will be neglected. Furthermore, temperature was not able to display the effect of down-welling. Stable isotopes and chloride were found to be suitable environmental tracers to forecast the release and fate of organic contaminants within the hyporheic zone. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

7,"Adams, JE",Jan 15 2021 ,The bioavailability of oil droplets trapped in river gravel by hyporheic flows,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Little is known about the fate of oil spills in rivers. Hyporheic flows of water through river sediments exchange surface and groundwater and create upwelling and downwelling zones that are important for fish spawning and embryo development. Risk assessments of oil spills to rivers do not consider the potential for hyporheic flows to carry oil droplets into sediments and the potential for prolonged exposure of fish to trapped oil. This project assessed whether oil droplets in water flowing through gravel will be trapped and whether hydrocarbons partitioning from trapped oil droplets are bioavailable to fish. Columns packed with gravel were injected with oil-in-water dispersions prepared with light crude, medium crude, diluted bitumens, and heavy fuel oil to generate a series of oil droplet loadings. The concentrations of oil trapped in the gravel increased with oil loading and viscosity. When the columns were perfused with clean water, oil concentrations in column effluents decreased to the detection limit within the first week of water flow, with sporadically higher concentrations associated with oil droplet release. Despite the low concentrations of hydrocarbons measured in column effluent, hydrocarbons were bioavailable to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) for more than three weeks of water flow, as indicated by strong induction of liver ethoxyresorufln-o-deethylase activity. These findings indicate that ecological risk assessments and spill response should identify and protect areas in rivers sensitive to contaminant trapping. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

8,"Crenshaw, CL",Apr 2010 ,Dissolved inorganic nitrogen dynamics in the hyporheic zone of reference and human-altered southwestern U. S. streams,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Canalization and incision are common morphological alterations associated with human land use that reduce hydrological/hydrodynamic linkages between surface and ground waters in stream ecosystems. To explore the impacts of these anthropogenic changes on nutrient spiraling in streams, we measured the linkage between hyporheic and surface zones of reference and human-altered streams using N-15-nitrate ((NO3-)-N-15) and bromide (Br-) tracer injection experiments. Experiments were conducted in 7 streams (3 reference, 3 agricultural and 1 urban) in Arizona and New Mexico, USA, over a 3 yr period during the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX II). Groundwater wells (6-9 in each stream) were inserted to 30 cm depth and multilevel samplers (MLS) were installed downstream from injection sites to measure inorganic nitrogen (N) and Br- concentrations in hyporheic water. There was measurable surface water-ground water (SW-GW) connectivity, as indicated by Br- concentrations in shallow alluvial ground water (0-30 cm depth) at all sites. SW-GW connectivity was higher in reference than in human-altered streams. Concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in MLS cells (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm below streambed) were inversely correlated, and N-15-enrichment of both N species was measurable in groundwater wells. Hyporheic zones with lower surface-water infiltration had higher quantities of (NH4+)-N-15 than of (NO3-)-N-15. Whole stream uptake (k(tot); calculated during the LINX II experiments) was correlated with delta(NH4+)-N-15 in wells; i.e., high delta(NH4+)-N-15 in wells was associated with high stream uptake, and both whole stream NO3- uptake and delta(NH4+)-N-15 were highest in the human-altered streams. The presence of enriched (NH4+)-N-15 in many of the wells within 24 h of injection suggested that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was occurring in the hyporheic zone.Show less"

10,"Wolke, P",Jan 2020 ,Impact of Bed Form Celerity on Oxygen Dynamics in the Hyporheic Zone,WATER,"Oxygen distribution and uptake in the hyporheic zone regulate various redox-sensitive reactions and influence habitat conditions. Despite the fact that fine-grain sediments in streams and rivers are commonly in motion, most studies on biogeochemistry have focused on stagnant sediments. In order to evaluate the effect of bed form celerity on oxygen dynamics and uptake in sandy beds, we conducted experiments in a recirculating indoor flume. Oxygen distribution in the bed was measured under various celerities using 2D planar optodes. Bed morphodynamics were measured by a surface elevation sensor and time-lapse photography. Oxygenated zones in stationary beds had a conchoidal shape due to influx through the stoss side of the bed form, and upwelling anoxic water at the lee side. Increasing bed celerity resulted in the gradual disappearance of the upwelling anoxic zone and flattening of the interface between the oxic (moving fraction of the bed) and the anoxic zone (stationary fraction of the bed), as well as in a reduction of the volumetric oxygen uptake rates due shortened residence times in the hyporheic zone. These results suggest that including processes related to bed form migration are important for understanding the biogeochemistry of hyporheic zones.Show less"
11,"Chen, XB",Apr 2020 ,Assessing connectivity between the river channel and floodplains during high flows using hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking analysis,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"River-floodplain connectivity is vital to hydrological and biogeochemical processes in river corridors over multiple spatiotemporal scales. In the present study, an approach of particle tracking in conjunction with two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling was developed to study the dynamics of river-floodplain connectivity during flood periods and applied to the study of McCarran Ranch in the lower Truckee River, Nevada, U.S. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated for flood events of different magnitudes of peak flow discharge. The outputs of the hydrodynamic model were further applied to determine the lateral transboundary flux during high flows. Lagrangian particle trajectories were then performed to quantify the flow path length and residence time on floodplains. The exchange frequency between the river mainstem and the floodplain were also examined.The results show that the hydrodynamic model reproduce hydrographs well. The river-floodplain exchange is sensitive to the magnitudes of the flood events. Larger floods cause shorter residence times and flow path lengths on the floodplains but lead to larger transboundary flux within the river reaches. The particle analysis results also show that higher discharge introduces less frequent exchange between the river channel and floodplains. Furthermore, comparison of the river-floodplain exchange properties among river reaches with different levels of sinuosity show that meandering reaches can introduce considerably higher exchange flux than a straight reach, leading to complex exchange behaviors within the river-floodplain system.Show less"
12,"Camarena, C",Jan 1 2016 ,"Modelling and experimental study of coupled exchange of p,p-DDE and colloids in a flume simulated stream-streambed system",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream-subsurface exchange plays a significant role in the fate and transport of contaminants in streams. It has been modelled explicitly by considering fundamental processes such as hydraulic exchange, colloid filtration, and contaminant interactions with streambed sediments and colloids. The models have been successfully applied to simulate the transport of inorganic metals and nutrients. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted in a recirculating flume to investigate the exchange of a hydrophobic organic contaminant, p,p-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethane (DDE), between a stream and a quartz sand bed. A previously developed process-based multiphase exchange model was modified by accounting for the p,p-DDE kinetic adsorption to and desorption from the bed sediments/colloids and was applied to interpret the experimental results. Model input parameters were obtained by conducting independent small-scale batch experiments. Results indicate that the immobilization of p,p-DDE in the quartz sand bed can occur under representative natural stream conditions. The observed p,p-DDE exchange was successfully simulated by the process-based model. The model sensitivity analysis results show that the exchange of p,p-DDE can be sensitive to either the sediment sorption/desorption parameters or colloidal parameters depending on the experimental conditions tested. For the experimental conditions employed here, the effect of colloids on contaminant transport is expected to be minimal, and the stream-subsurface exchange of p,p-DDE is dominated by the interaction of p,p-DDE with bed sediment. The work presented here contributes to a better mechanistic understanding of the complex transport process that hydrophobic organic contaminants undergo in natural streams and to the development of reliable, predictive models for the assessment of impacted streams.

13,"Datry, T",Jun 2010 ,Hyporheic annelid distribution along a flow permanence gradient in an alluvial river,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"In this study, we examined hyporheic annelid assemblages along a gradient of flow permanence (FP) and compared assemblages in gaining (groundwater-fed) and losing (runoff-fed) sections of the alluvial Selwyn River, New Zealand. To reduce the effects of poor taxonomic resolution, we used a dataset with most taxa identified to the genus or species level. We predicted that annelid assemblages would vary in structure and composition along FP gradients due to differences in desiccation resistance between taxa. We also predicted that groundwater-fed (gaining) and runoff-fed (losing) river sections would be inhabitated by dissimilar annelid assemblages due to differences in river-aquifer connections and recolonization sources. We found a negative relationship between taxon richness and FP, indicating that, on average, two annelid taxa are lost from hyporheic assemblages in the Selwyn River with every 10% decrease in FP. Low FP appears to favour annelid taxa that tolerate moist or dry conditions in sediments, as shown by a negative relationship between FP and the proportion of desiccation-tolerant taxa. A high proportion of hypogean taxa distinguished the groundwater-fed and perennial-gaining reach from the other reaches. In spite of the large differences in physical structure between the intermittent-gaining and the ephemeral-losing reach, we found few between-reach differences in annelid assemblages and, in particular, no differences in % hypogean taxa. These varied results illustrate the need to employ both categorical and continuous variables in ecological analyses: the combined categorical and gradient approach used in the present study is likely to explain more variability than either univariate approach alone.Show less"
14,"Banzhaf, S",May 2011 ,Investigative approaches to determine exchange processes in the hyporheic zone of a low permeability riverbank,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"The hydraulic and hydrochemical interactions of surface water and groundwater in the riverbank of an alluvial stream in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were investigated. Hydraulic conductivity in the riverbank is low and the aquifer is confined. Gauged surface-water levels and groundwater levels were recorded over several months to observe potential effluent and influent aquifer conditions. Water samples were taken under different hydraulic conditions in the stream and from three observation wells in the riverbank. Samples were analysed for inorganic parameters and selected dissolved pharmaceuticals. The recorded groundwater levels in the riverbank responded almost without delay to changes in stream stage, which is very dynamic. Frequent changes from effluent to influent aquifer conditions were observed. The analyses for selected ions and pharmaceuticals support the assumption that the pharmaceutical compounds enter the riverbank via the stream only. The chosen trace organics are therefore suitable as anthropogenic tracers for groundwater and surface-water interactions at this field site. They prove that water exchanges also take place in riverbanks even where the hydraulic conductivity is low and for this reason indicate the existence of a hyporheic zone in the investigated section of the stream.Show less"
15,"Lewin, J",Jun 15 2014 ,Defining large river channel patterns: Alluvial exchange and plurality,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Large rivers have anabranching channels with components that may be defined as braided, meandering or straight. This paper shows that application of such holistic terminologies is complicated by recognition of within-type and transitional-type variety, a confusingly varied use of terms, and a coverage of pattern characteristics that for many large rivers is incomplete. In natural states, big rivers can be plural systems in which main, accessory, tributary and floodplain channels and lakes differ functionally and vary in terms of morphological dynamics. A distinction is drawn between the hydrological and geomorphological connectivity of components in big river plural systems. At any one time, even at flood stage, only some channels are geomorphologically active. Six types of geomorphological connectivity are described that range from coupled, through to partially-coupled and decoupled. The interplay between geomorphological and hydrological connectivity in large rivers is shown to determine habitat status and therefore ecological diversity. For improved understanding of the dynamics as well as the forms of these large composite systems, it is helpful to: (1) adopt element-level specification, not only for sediment bodies, but also for functioning channels; (2) track the sediment transfer processes and exchanges that produce channel forms over the highly varied timescales operating within large rivers; and (3) recognise the ways in which partially coupled and connected geomorphological systems produce naturally a composite set of forms at different rates. Such augmenting information will provide an improved platform for both river management and ecological understanding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
16,"Wu, YX",Sep 25 2013 ,Hyporheic exchange in a karst conduit and sediment system - A laboratory analog study,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Karst conduits are often partly filled by clastic sediments. Flow through such sediments can have a strong impact on the fate of sediment-entrapped contaminants. In contrast to stream bed sediments, hyporheic flow in karst sediments has received little attention so far. For karst sediments, conduit bends could induce hyporheic flow, in addition to bedforms or obstacles. The main aim of this study was to investigate flow processes in a conduit-sediment system using a laboratory model resembling a siphon and numerical modeling. In the laboratory system, zones with forward and reserve flow occurred in the sediment due to the conduit bends. As demonstrated with sediment-source tracer test, entrapped solutes were generally flushed out more rapidly at a higher flow rate and steeper conduit angle. Numerical modeling assuming pressure continuity across the conduit-sediment interface reproduced the flow patterns and breakthrough curves (BTCs) well. Based on the model, the magnitude of hyporheic exchange is expected to increase linearly with the flow rate and was higher for a steeper conduit angle. However, the increase in flushing intensity was not evenly distributed throughout the sediments but occurred mainly adjacent to the conduit bends consistent with observations from tracer tests. This study confirms that conduit bends could have a strong influence on hyporheic flow in karst sediments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
17,"O'Connor, BL",Dec 17 2008 ,Scaling hyporheic exchange and its influence on biogeochemical reactions in aquatic ecosystems,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical reactions are difficult to quantify because of the range in fluid-flow and sediment conditions inherent to streams, wetlands, and nearshore marine ecosystems. Field measurements of biogeochemical reactions in aquatic systems are impeded by the difficulty of measuring hyporheic flow simultaneously with chemical gradients in sediments. Simplified models of hyporheic exchange have been developed using Darcy's law generated by flow and bed topography at the sediment-water interface. However, many modes of transport are potentially involved ( molecular diffusion, bioturbation, advection, shear, bed mobility, and turbulence) with even simple models being difficult to apply in complex natural systems characterized by variable sediment sizes and irregular bed geometries. In this study, we synthesize information from published hyporheic exchange investigations to develop a scaling relationship for estimating mass transfer in near-surface sediments across a range in fluid-flow and sediment conditions. Net hyporheic exchange was quantified using an effective diffusion coefficient ( De) that integrates all of the various transport processes that occur simultaneously in sediments, and dimensional analysis was used to scale De to shear stress velocity, roughness height, and permeability that describe fluid-flow and sediment characteristics. We demonstrated the value of the derived scaling relationship by using it to quantify dissolved oxygen ( DO) uptake rates on the basis of DO profiles in sediments and compared them to independent flux measurements. The results support a broad application of the De scaling relationship for quantifying coupled hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical reaction rates in streams and other aquatic ecosystems characterized by complex fluid-flow and sediment conditions.Show less"
18,"Marion, A",May 2003 ,Parameter estimation of the transient storage model for stream-subsurface exchange,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,"The transient storage model (TSM) is the most commonly used model for stream-subsurface exchange of solutes. The TSM provides a convenient, simplified representation of hyporheic exchange, but its lack of a true physical basis causes its parameters to be difficult to predict. However, the simple formulation makes the model a useful practical tool for many applications. This work compares the TSM with a physically based pumping model. This comparison is advantageous for two reasons: Advective pumping is known to be an important hyporheic exchange process in many streams, and the pumping model can be used to derive dimensionless transient storage parameters that are properly scaled with important physical stream parameters. Transient storage model parameters are shown to be dependent on both the timescale of observation and the shape of the breakthrough curve, i.e., on the temporal evolution of the solute concentration in the surface water. This indicates that the transient storage model can, in practice, lead to incorrect predictions when model parameters are obtained without consideration of the stream flow dynamics, the properties of the stream bed, or the process timescale. This work emphasizes the limitations of simplified models for hyporheic transport, and indicates that such models need to be carefully applied.Show less"
19,"McGarr, JT",Sep 2021 ,Geophysical mapping of hyporheic processes controlled by sedimentary architecture within compound bar deposits,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hyporheic exchange influences water quality and controls numerous physical, chemical, and biological processes. Despite its importance, hyporheic exchange and the associated dynamics of solute mixing are often difficult to characterize due to spatial (e.g., sedimentary heterogeneity) and temporal (e.g., river stage fluctuation) variabilities. This study coupled geophysical techniques with physical and chemical sediment analyses to map sedimentary architecture and quantify its influence on hyporheic exchange dynamics within a compound bar deposit in a gravel-dominated river system in southwestern Ohio. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) was used to quantify variability in electrical conductivity within the compound bar. EMI informed locations of electrode placement for time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) surveys, which were used to examine changes in electrical resistivity driven by hyporheic exchange. Both geophysical methods revealed a zone of high electrical conductivity in the center of the bar, identified as a fine-grained cross-bar channel fill. The zone acts as a baffle to flow, evidenced by stable electrical conditions measured by time-lapse ERI over the study period. Large changes in electrical resistivity throughout the survey period indicate preferential flowpaths through higher permeability sands and gravels. Grain size analyses confirmed sedimentological interpretations of geophysical data. Loss on ignition and x-ray fluorescence identified zones with higher organic matter content that are locations for potentially enhanced geochemical activity within the cross-bar channel fill. Differences in the physical and geochemical characteristics of cross-bar channel fills play an important role in hyporheic flow dynamics and nutrient processing within riverbed sediments. These findings enhance our understanding of the applications of geophysical methods in mapping riverbed heterogeneity and highlight the importance of accurately representing geomorphologic features and heterogeneity when studying hyporheic exchange processes.Show less"
20,"Boano, F",May 3 2008 ,Reduction of the hyporheic zone volume due to the stream-aquifer interaction,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Pore water in stream sediments is continuously exchanged with the surface water from the overlying stream. This exchange of water and solutes that occurs across the stream-sediment interface plays an important role for fluvial ecology because of the unique biochemical conditions, rich biodiversity, and high rates of metabolism. While many studies have observed the extent of the hyporheic zone to be modified by changes in the level of the groundwater table, the actual importance of this interaction is still difficult to quantify. Here, we focus on the case of bedform induced hyporheic exchange to show how the the volume of hyporheic sediments that receive water from the stream is significantly reduced by the upwelling of subsurface water. A simple scaling relationship for the assessment of maximum depth of the hyporheic zone is proposed by relating hyporheic flow to the groundwater discharge in an aquifer with given hydraulic properties and head difference between the stream and the aquifer.Show less"
21,"Lin, HY",Mar 2020 ,Trade-offs among road-stream crossing upgrade prioritizations based on connectivity restoration and erosion risk control,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Prioritizing projects to improve cost-effectiveness has become a common practice in natural resources management, especially in selecting sites for river restoration work. Previous studies for prioritizing road-stream crossing upgrade projects focused on either restoring river connectivity or reducing sedimentation, even though crossings can affect connectivity and sedimentation simultaneously. In this study, we simulated site selection to maximize the improvement of connectivity restoration and sedimentation reduction of three prioritization schemes targeting (a) river connectivity, (b) erosion risk, or (c) both objectives concurrently and compared the results. Furthermore, we examined the relationships between the cost-effectiveness of prioritizations and watershed characteristics. We found significant differences among the effectiveness of prioritization objectives; thus, trade-offs should be taken into consideration when prioritizing crossings. The incorporation of spatial interdependency among crossings and weighting objectives could significantly change the cost-effectiveness. We also found that splitting the budget and using a portion to individually prioritize each objective could be more cost-effective than using the whole budget to achieve concurrent objectives. Watershed characteristics like size and connectivity- and sedimentation-related factors could be used to help identify effective management for both connectivity restoration and sedimentation control.Show less"

Two laboratory analogues consisting of siphon structured glass tubes (with bend angles of 15 and 45A degrees) were used for the experimental studies. Tracer experiments were performed in each analogue with sediments of variable grain size (0.45 mm, 0.4-0.7 mm, 1 mm) to characterize the transport properties of contaminants originating from the sediments. Numerical simulations were used to probe the exchange flow patterns and exchange flux magnitudes between the conduit and sediment. Tracer experiments demonstrated a zone of forward flow and a zone of reverse flow in the sediments that were independent of grain size, which were reproduced well by numerical simulations. The exchange flux ranged from 0.02% for fine grains to 2% for coarse grains under the experimental flow conditions. A linear relationship between the exchange flux and the conduit Re value, which was independent of the conduit geometry and sediment grain size, was established with numerical simulations. This study demonstrated that sediment grain size/permeability has no influence on the exchange flow patterns; however, relative to the conduit flow rate and conduit geometry/angle, sediment permeability has a much stronger influence on the exchange rate of hyporheic flow.Show less"
24,"McManamay, RA",Feb 2019 ,Commonalities in stream connectivity restoration alternatives: an attempt to simplify barrier removal optimization,ECOSPHERE,"Movement within stream corridors is a basic life history requirement of many aquatic organisms. Barrier removal in streams has become a common practice in the United States aimed to restore organism dispersal and meet conservation objectives; however, there are social and economic costs to the removal of barriers. Accordingly, tools to prioritize barrier removal, particularly optimization techniques, can be used to evaluate cost-benefit trade-offs. Many of these techniques, however, require programming experience and are not available to natural resource managers. Furthermore, conservation objectives vary considerably depending on the life histories of organisms under consideration, and these opposing objectives, in conjunction with variant socioeconomic costs, will influence optimization solutions, specifically which barriers to remove. To promote the use of optimization tools, straightforward and open-access platforms are needed to support use by managers, while also providing general approaches for holistic basin-scale connectivity restoration. Herein, we use two case studies, White Oak Creek (small watershed) and the Roanoke River Basin (large basin), to explore the divergent outcomes stemming from different conservation objectives and socioeconomic costs used to prioritize barrier removal. We conducted optimization modeling using a widely accessible platform along with an open-access solver plug-in to support a wide variety of conservation objectives. We used simple approaches to find commonalities in barriers identified for removal among divergent conservation objectives and provide alternative (i.e., hybrid removal-passage) strategies for approaching habitat restoration for diverse aquatic communities while increasing social benefits (i.e., hydropower energy). As expected, different conservation objectives aimed to support varied species life histories (e.g., diadromy, large-river vs. small-river potamodromy) have very different effects on optimization solutions. In both case studies, however, commonalities in solutions were identified through clustering groups of barriers into general connectivity restoration strategies. Furthermore, strategy types for a given barrier could be predicted with >= 72% accuracy using only four metrics. This suggests that optimization results can be simplified into general standards to support adoption of sustainable basin connectivity criteria strategies. Our framework provides a flexible and open-access approach to conduct relatively complex optimization modeling for stream barrier prioritization, while examining potential for agreement among divergence conservation objectives.Show less"
25,"Tonina, D",Aug 4 2011 ,"Effects of stream discharge, alluvial depth and bar amplitude on hyporheic flow in pool-riffle channels",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic flow results from the interaction between streamflow and channel morphology and is an important component of stream ecosystems because it enhances water and solute exchange between the river and its bed. Hyporheic flow in pool-riffle channels is particularly complex because of three-dimensional topography that spans a range of partially to fully submerged conditions, inducing both static and dynamic head variations. Hence, these channels exhibit transitional conditions of streambed pressure and hyporheic flow compared to previous studies of fully submerged, two-dimensional bed forms. Here, we conduct a series of three-dimensional simulations to investigate the effects of bed topography, depth of alluvium, and stream discharge on hyporheic flow in pool-riffle reaches with variable bed form submergence, and we propose three empirical formulae to predict the mean depth of hyporheic exchange and characteristic values of the residence time distribution (mean and standard deviation). Hyporheic exchange is predicted with a three-dimensional pumping model, and hyporheic flow is modeled as a Darcy flow. We find that the hyporheic residence time is well approximated by a lognormal distribution for both partially and entirely submerged pool-riffle topography, with the parameters of the distribution defined by the mean and variance of the log-transformed residence time. Depth of alluvium has a substantial effect on hyporheic flow when alluvial depth is less than a third of the bed form wavelength for the conditions examined.Show less"

27,"Storey, RG",Feb 18 2003 ,Factors controlling riffle-scale hyporheic exchange flows and their seasonal changes in a gaining stream: A three-dimensional groundwater flow model,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Subsurface flow within a single riffle of a low-gradient gravel bed stream was modeled in three dimensions using MODFLOW, a finite difference groundwater flow model. Model simulations showed that exchange flows can only occur in this low-gradient, gaining stream because of a zone of alluvial sediment around the stream that has much higher permeability than the surrounding catchment (K = 10(-4) m s(-1), compared with K = 10(-6) to 10(-8) m s(-1)). The key factors controlling exchange flow within the alluvial zone were identified as the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium, the hydraulic gradient between upstream and downstream ends of the riffle, and the flux of groundwater entering the alluvium from the sides and beneath. In the study riffle each of these factors changes with season, causing a reversal of flow paths in the alluvium and a reduction in exchange flows from about 0.2 - 0.5 m(3) d(-1) per meter stream length in summer to about 0.008-0.04 m(3) d(-1) per meter stream length during fall to spring. The model also revealed that exchange flows are up to twice as strong, but more variable, at the sides of the stream than near the center, and that vertical flow paths beneath the channel are more persistent under the range of conditions modeled than lateral flow paths into the banks.Show less"
28,"Stonedahl, SH",Oct 6 2012 ,Physical controls and predictability of stream hyporheic flow evaluated with a multiscale model,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Improved predictions of hyporheic exchange based on easily measured physical variables are needed to improve assessment of solute transport and reaction processes in watersheds. Here we compare physically based model predictions for an Indiana stream with stream tracer results interpreted using the Transient Storage Model (TSM). We parameterized the physically based, Multiscale Model (MSM) of stream-groundwater interactions with measured stream planform and discharge, stream velocity, streambed hydraulic conductivity and porosity, and topography of the streambed at distinct spatial scales (i.e., ripple, bar, and reach scales). We predicted hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic residence times using the MSM. A Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) model was used to convert the MSM output into predictions of in stream solute transport, which we compared with field observations and TSM parameters obtained by fitting solute transport data. MSM simulations indicated that surface-subsurface exchange through smaller topographic features such as ripples was much faster than exchange through larger topographic features such as bars. However, hyporheic exchange varies nonlinearly with groundwater discharge owing to interactions between flows induced at different topographic scales. MSM simulations showed that groundwater discharge significantly decreased both the volume of water entering the subsurface and the time it spent in the subsurface. The MSM also characterized longer timescales of exchange than were observed by the tracer-injection approach. The tracer data, and corresponding TSM fits, were limited by tracer measurement sensitivity and uncertainty in estimates of background tracer concentrations. Our results indicate that rates and patterns of hyporheic exchange are strongly influenced by a continuum of surface-subsurface hydrologic interactions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales rather than discrete processes.Show less"
29,"Marzadri, A",Feb 2016 ,"Mixing interfaces, fluxes, residence times and redox conditions of the hyporheic zones induced by dune-like bedforms and ambient groundwater flow",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Recent studies highlighted the importance of the interface between streams and their surrounding sediment, known as the hyporheic zone, where stream waters flow through the alluvium. These pore water fluxes stem from the interaction among streambed morphology, stream hydraulics and surrounding groundwater flow. We analytically model the hyporheic hydraulics induced by a spatially uniform ambient groundwater flow made of a horizontal, underflow, and a vertical, basal, component, which mimics gaining and losing stream conditions. The proposed analytical solution allows to investigate the control of simple hydromorphological quantities on the extent, residence time and redox conditions of the hyporheic zone, and the thickness of the mixing interface between hyporheic and groundwater cells. Our analysis shows that the location of the mixing zone shallows or deepens in the sediment as a function of bedform geometry, surface hydraulic and groundwater flow. The point of stagnation, where hyporheic flow velocities vanish and where the separation surface passes through, is shallower than or coincides with the deepest point of the hyporheic zone only due to underflow. An increase of the ambient flow causes a reduction of the hyporheic zone volume similarly in both losing and gaining conditions. The hyporheic residence time is lognormally distributed under neutral, losing and gaining conditions, with the residence time moments depending on the same set of parameters describing dune morphology and stream flow.

30,"Mathers, KL",Nov 2014 ,Faunal response to benthic and hyporheic sedimentation varies with direction of vertical hydrological exchange,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Sedimentation and clogging of benthic and hyporheic zone substrata is increasingly being recognised as one of the greatest threats to the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems globally. This ex situ study examined the influence of sedimentation (surface and subsurface) and pattern of hydrological exchange on the vertical distribution of the freshwater shrimp Gammarus pulex within the experimental substrata of running water mesocosms.2. Six sediment treatments representing a continuum from a clean gravel substratum to heavy sediment loading of both surface (benthic) and subsurface (hyporheic) substrata were used to examine the distribution of G. pulex in relation to the direction of hydrological exchange (downwelling, upwelling and no exchange).3. The distribution of G. pulex between the sediment layers was dependent on the pattern of hydrological exchange, sediment treatment and the interaction between these two factors.4. Sedimentation of the surface layer under no-exchange conditions resulted in a lower proportion of G. pulex being recorded in the benthic sediments, whilst there were no significant differences under downwelling and upwelling flow conditions.5. Sedimentation of multiple layers of the column (benthic and subsurface) reduced the ability of individuals to utilise the subsurface layers of the substratum (i.e. the hyporheic zone) under no-exchange and upwelling conditions. However, with downwelling conditions, the abundance of G. pulex declined with depth regardless of the fine sediment distribution or volume.6. This study demonstrates that faunal movement, and use of benthic and hyporheic substrata, may be influenced by sedimentation and modified by the pattern of vertical hydrological exchange. Severe sedimentation (colmation) has the potential to prevent benthic fauna from accessing the hyporheic zone and its resources which may ultimately lead to a reduction in stream diversity and metabolism, thereby limiting overall productivity and lotic ecosystem resilience.Show less"
31,"Peter, KT",Mar 1 2019 ,Evaluating emerging organic contaminant removal in an engineered hyporheic zone using high resolution mass spectrometry,WATER RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone (HZ), located at the interface of surface and groundwater, is a natural bioreactor for attenuation of chemical contaminants. Engineered HZs can be incorporated into stream restoration projects to enhance hyporheic exchange, with flowpaths optimized to promote biological habitat, water quantity, and water quality improvements. Designing HZs for in-stream treatment of stormwater, a significant source of flow and contaminant loads to urban creeks, requires assessment of both the hydrology and biogeochemical capacity for water quality improvement. Here, we applied tracer tests and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to characterize an engineered hyporheic zone unit process, called a hyporheic design element (HDE), in the Thornton Creek Watershed in Seattle, WA. Dye, NaCl, and bromide were used to hydrologically link downwelling and upwelling zones and estimate the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of hyporheic flowpaths. We then compared water quality improvements across hydrologically-linked surface and hyporheic flowpaths (3-5 m length; similar to 30 min to >3 h) during baseflow and stormflow conditions. We evaluated fate outcomes for 83 identified contaminants during stormflow, including those correlated with an urban runoff mortality syndrome in coho salmon. Non-target HRMS analysis was used to assess holistic water quality improvements and evaluate attenuation mechanisms. The data indicated substantial water quality improvement in hyporheic flowpaths relative to surface flow and improved contaminant removal with longer hyporheic HRT (for similar to 1900 non-target compounds detected during stormflow, <17% were attenuated >50% via surface flow vs. 59% and 78% via short and long hyporheic residence times, respectively), and strong contributions of hydrophobic sorption towards observed contaminant attenuation.

Among the factors that drive water exchange between a stream and its sediments, turbulence is the most ubiquitous as rivers are always in turbulent flow regime. However, there is still much uncertainty about the role of turbulent processes in hyporheic exchange, probably because of the complex nonlinearities that characterize the dynamics of turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations. In this paper, we adopt a numerical modeling approach to investigate the relationship between turbulent pressure properties and the resulting features of surface-subsurface exchange. In particular, we discuss the importance of large coherent structures of turbulence in driving exchange at depths that are much larger than the penetration depth of small turbulent eddies. The results of the numerical simulations elucidate the response of turbulent hyporheic exchange to changes in stream depth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
34,"Hester, ET",Sep 2013 ,Mixing of surface and groundwater induced by riverbed dunes: Implications for hyporheic zone definitions and pollutant reactions,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone is often defined as where mixing of surface water and groundwater occurs in shallow sediments beneath and adjacent to rivers. This mixing is credited with creating unique biogeochemical conditions that can attenuate contaminants from either upstream surface water or groundwater under gaining conditions. However, reactions of contaminants upwelling from groundwater may be more dependent on such mixing than contaminants from surface water. We numerically modeled mixing between hyporheic flow paths induced by riverbed dunes and flow paths of adjacent upwelling of deeper groundwater. Results show that only 12.7% or less tracer mass upwelling from deeper groundwater dispersed across into hyporheic flow paths originating in surface water. The spatial extent of a mixing-defined hyporheic zone was smaller than a hyporheic zone defined as hydrologic flow paths leaving and returning to surface water. Mixing-dependent reactions will therefore be localized within a thin mixing zone yet vary considerably with site conditions. For example, mixing in homogeneous sediments was controlled most by variation in hydraulic conductivity and upwelling flow rate which primarily affected mixing zone length. By contrast, introduction of heterogeneity increased mixing primarily by increasing mixing zone thickness, consistent with studies of flow focusing in aquifers. Finally, dispersivity is a critical parameter for which data are needed for shallow sediments. Our results help clarify hyporheic zone definitions and potential for mixing-dependent reactions. In particular, the biogeochemically reactive portion of riverbed sediments from the perspective of upwelling contaminants does not necessarily spatially coincide with more traditional hydrologic conceptions of the hyporheic zone.Show less"
35,"Pacioglu, O",Apr 2017 ,The chalk hyporheic zone: a true ecotone?,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"This review summarises the main ecotonal properties of chalk hyporheic zone (CHZ), using a holistic approach on both structure and functionality of this habitat. The corroborated results suggest that the CHZ represents a typically shallow habitat (approx. 40-50 cm deep), with a homogenous distribution of both fauna and chemistry between heads and tails of riffles (putative down and, respectively, upwelling zones). Despite being groundwater fed, the CHZ is equally influenced by surface waters, chemically and biologically. However, despite its shallowness, the CHZ plays a very important role in nutrients (re)cycling and in the energy flux towards river ecosystems, fuelling benthic food webs with surface-derived macronutrients and subsurface chemosynthetic C. Although groundwater variation influences strongly the river flow during winter, the effects on interstitial fauna dynamic are limited, suggesting the active role of CHZ played in the stochastic events of down/upward migration of fauna across habitats. Overall, the CHZ represents a confined, but critical habitat in the structure and functionality of chalk river ecosystems and fulfils most properties of a true ecotone.Show less"
36,"Heppell, C",Mar 2014 ,Interpreting spatial patterns in redox and coupled water-nitrogen fluxes in the streambed of a gaining river reach,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Water pathways through permeable riverbeds are multi-dimensional, including lateral hyporheic exchange flows as well as vertical (upwelling and downwelling) fluxes. The influence of different pathways of water on solute patterns and the supply of nitrate and other redox-sensitive chemical species in the riverbed is poorly understood but could be environmentally significant. For example, nitrate-rich upwelling water in the gaining reaches of groundwater-fed rivers has the potential to supply significant quantities of nitrate through the riverbed to surface waters, constraining opportunities to deliver the goals of the EU Water Framework Directive to achieve 'good ecological status'. We show that patterns in porewater chemistry in the armoured river bed of a gaining reach (River Leith, Cumbria) reflect the spatial variability in different sources of water; oxic conditions being associated with preferential discharge from groundwater and reducing conditions with longitudinal and lateral fluxes of water due to water movement from riparian zones and/or hyporheic exchange flows. Our findings demonstrate the important control of both vertical and lateral water fluxes on patterns of redox-sensitive chemical species in the river bed. Furthermore, under stable, baseflow conditions (< Q(90)) a zone of preferential discharge, comprising 20 % of the reach by area contributes 4-9 % of the total nitrate being transported through the reach in surface water, highlighting the need to understand the spatial distribution of such preferential discharge locations at the catchment scale to establish their importance for nitrate delivery to the stream channel.Show less"

Enhancing hyporheic exchange may facilitate achieving these goals. Although hyporheic exchange at restoration sites has been explored in a few previous studies, comparative studies of restored versus reference or control streams are largely absent. We hypothesized that restoration cross-vanes enhance hyporheic exchange, resulting in biogeochemical alteration of stream water chemistry in the streambed. Two streams restored using cross-vanes to control erosion and improve habitat were compared with their associated reference reaches, which provided the basis for the restoration design. Thirteen temperature profile rods with vertically stacked sensors were installed at each site for 2weeks. Heat tracing was used to quantify vertical flux in the streambed from the diurnal temperature fluctuations in the subsurface. Stream water and bed pore waters from mini-piezometers were analysed for ion and nutrient chemistry. In general, mean vertical flux rates through the streambed were small throughout reference sites (-0.3 to 0.3m/day) and at most locations at restored sites. Immediately adjacent to cross-vanes, vertical flux rates were larger (up to 3.5m/day). Geochemistry of pore waters shows distinct differences in the sources for the reference and restored sites. Strong downwelling zones adjacent to cross-vanes showed high dissolved oxygen (10.75mg/l) and geochemistry in the streambed similar to surface water. Reference sites had lower dissolved oxygen in the streambed (0.66-5.14mg/l), and geochemical patterns suggest a mixture of discharging groundwater and surface water in the hyporheic zone. Restored sites also clearly show sulfate and nitrate reduction occurring in the streambed, which is not observed at the reference sites. The stream restoration sites studied here enhance rapid hyporheic exchange, but upwelling of groundwater has a stronger influence on streambed geochemistry at reference sites.

Field investigations and numerical modelling have been completed at a range of spatial and temporal scales from the metre to the kilometre scale and from event (hourly) to multi-annual time scales. The objective has been to quantify the spatial and temporal flow distributions governing mixing processes at the aquifer-river interface that can affect the chemical activity in the hyporheic zone of this urbanised river. The hyporheic zone is defined to be the zone of physical mixing of river and aquifer water. The results highlight the multi-scale controls that govern the fluid exchange distributions that influence the thickness of the mixing zone between urban rivers and groundwater and the patterns of groundwater flow through the bed of the river. The morphologies of the urban river bed and the adjacent river bank sediments are found to be particularly influential in developing the mixing zone at the interface between river and groundwater. Pressure transients in the river are also found to exert an influence on velocity distribution in the bed material. Areas of significant mixing do not appear to be related to the areas of greatest groundwater discharge and therefore this relationship requires further investigation to quantify the actual remedial capacity of the physical hyporheic zone.

Yet, there is a lack of methods for assessing the spatial extent and distribution of these mixing zones. This study applied time-lapse electrical resistivity (ER) imaging in a 60-m wide and 0.7-m deep alluvial river whose stage periodically varied by 0.7 m due to dam operations to assess dynamic hyporheic mixing and surface water-groundwater interactions. Sixteen channel-spanning repeat ER tomograms (2D sections) over one flood cycle captured the dynamic ER distribution. We mapped a laterally discontinuous hyporheic zone, which had mainly river water circulating through it, several meters into the bed. Underneath the hyporheic zone was a transitional mixing zone intermittently flushed by mixing river water and deep groundwater. Minimally mixed groundwater dominated the deepest areas. ER imaging allows for unraveling hyporheic and deep mixing zone dynamics in large regulated rivers.Show less"

The hyporheos was sampled along a 130-m stretch at depths of 0.3, 0.6 and 1 m in a pool-riffle sequence and a lateral gravel bar. Benthic fauna was collected on each sampling occasion from different locations in the studied sections. Sampling was conducted in two consecutive years (2014 and 2015) at the end of the spring (high waters) and over a 2-month period during the low summer flow. The results indicated that high surface water temperatures may initiate the movement of some taxa into the interstitial habitat, thus supporting the hyporheic refuge hypothesis. In the hyporheic zone, the low oxygen rates recorded deeper in the sediment and in the last low-flow months caused significant declines in taxonomic richness, and lower pH values resulted in a reduction in invertebrate abundances. In the benthic zone, high flow velocities increased richness but decreased invertebrate abundances. A large number of taxa were found in the gravel bar section reflecting the more suitable living conditions in this habitat compared with the river reach (high DO rates).Show less"
43,"Sendrowski, A",Mar 2017 ,Process connectivity in a naturally prograding river delta,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"River deltas are lowland systems that can display high hydrological connectivity. This connectivity can be structural (morphological connections), functional (control of fluxes), and process connectivity (information flow from system drivers to sinks). In this work, we quantify hydrological process connectivity in Wax Lake Delta, coastal Louisiana, by analyzing couplings among external drivers (discharge, tides, and wind) and water levels recorded at five islands and one channel over summer 2014. We quantify process connections with information theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with the communication of information. We represent process connections as a network; variables serve as network nodes and couplings as network links describing the strength, direction, and time scale of information flow. Comparing process connections at long (105 days) and short (10 days) time scales, we show that tides exhibit daily synchronization with water level, with decreasing strength from downstream to upstream, and that tides transfer information as tides transition from spring to neap. Discharge synchronizes with water level and the time scale of its information transfer compares well to physical travel times through the system, computed with a hydrodynamic model. Information transfer and physical transport show similar spatial patterns, although information transfer time scales are larger than physical travel times. Wind events associated with water level setup lead to increased process connectivity with highly variable information transfer time scales. We discuss the information theory results in the context of the hydrologic behavior of the delta, the role of vegetation as a connector/disconnector on islands, and the applicability of process networks as tools for delta modeling results.Plain Language Summary Connectivity is an increasingly important concept in studying the complexity and evolution of landscapes. One aspect of connectivity often overlooked is process connectivity; the interaction between external drivers and system variables such as water level and sediment concentration. A better understanding of deltaic process connectivity would benefit numerical modelers in improving delta simulations. In this work, we apply information theory to directly quantify for the first time the connectivity between discharge, wind, and tides, and water level at five deltaic islands and one channel in Wax Lake Delta (WLD), a prograding delta in coastal Louisiana that is often cast as an analog of a river diversion system. The importance of deltaic islands as areas of increased biogeochemical processing make this analysis particularly relevant to better understand the hydrologic controls on islands. Our results highlight the multi-scale interactions between external drivers and deltaic water level. The role of wind events, tidal regime, and vegetation controls in process connectivity indicate the dynamic nature of deltaic systems. Couplings are characterized in terms of strength, direction, significance, and scale. Process connectivity is visualized as a process network; variables are network nodes and couplings are network links that depict significant information flow.Show less"
44,"Bottacin-Busolin, A",Nov 2019 ,Modeling the Effect of Hyporheic Mixing on Stream Solute Transport,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Mixing in the hyporheic zone plays a key role in controlling the fate and transport of contaminants in streams and rivers. Consistently with recent experimental and numerical results, a physically based one-dimensional solute transport model is presented that represents hyporheic mixing as a diffusion process exponentially attenuated with depth. When vertical diffusion in the sediment bed is not limited by an impermeable boundary, the moments of the breakthrough curves (BTCs) generated by the model exhibit persistent non-Fickian behavior and are shown to scale consistently with existing experimental evidence. The ability of the exponentially attenuated mixing model to represent experimental BTCs was tested using data from field and flume tracer experiments, and its performance was compared with that of a classic two-storage zone model. While both models provided an equally good approximation for the BTCs observed in field tracer tests, the exponentially attenuated mixing model provided better fits for the flume experiments. Analysis of the model equations and their solutions shows that, if the flow cross-sectional area and wetted perimeter are not predetermined, there are infinite sets of parameter values that produce the same space-time concentration distributions. The result implies that the physical parameters of hyporheic exchange cannot be determined by sole measurements of the solute BTCs in the surface water unless flow cross-sectional area and average flow depth can be independently estimated.Show less"

A tracer injection experiment using bromide (Br-) was conducted in the stream system. Simulations with a transport model showed that rates of exchange between the stream and hyporheic zone were rapid (alpha approximate to 10(-3) s(-1)). Parallel factor analysis of fluorescence spectra was used to quantify the redox state of dissolved fulvic acids. The rate coefficient for oxidation of reduced fulvic acids (lambda = 6.5 x 10(-3) s(-1)) in the stream indicates that electron-transfer reactions occur over short time scales. The rate coefficients for decay of ammonium (lambda = 1.2 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and production of nitrate (lambda = -1.0 x 10(-3) s(-1)) were opposite in sign but almost equal in magnitude. Our results suggest that fulvic acids are involved in rapid electron-transfer processes in and near the stream channel and may be important in determining ecological energy flow at the catchment scale.Show less"
46,"Tockner, K",May 1999 ,"Hydrological connectivity, and the exchange of organic matter and nutrients in a dynamic river-floodplain system (Danube, Austria)",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The relationship between hydrological connectivity, and the exchange processes of suspended sediments, organic matter and nutrients (NO3-N) was investigated in a dynamically connected river-floodplain segment of the Danube over a 15-month period in 1995 and 1996 in the Alluvial Zone National Park, Austria.2. Based on water level dynamics and water retention times, three phases of river-floodplain connectivity were identified: disconnection (phase I), seepage inflow (phase II) and upstream surface connection (phase III). The frequency of occurrence of these phases was 67.5%, 29.3% and 3.2%, respectively, during the study period.3. A conceptual model is presented linking hydrological connectivity with ecological processes. Generally, the floodplain shifts from a closed and mainly biologically controlled ecosystem during phase I to an increasingly open and more hydrologically controlled system during phases II and III. Phase I, with internal processes dominating, is designated the 'biotic interaction phase'.4. Phase II, with massive nutrient inputs to the floodplain yet relatively high residence times, and therefore, high algal biomass, is classified as the 'primary production phase'. This demonstrates that water level fluctuations well below bankfull may considerably enhance floodplain productivity.5. Finally, since transport of particulate matter is mainly restricted to short flood pulses above bankfull level, phase III has been defined as the 'transport phase'.6. The floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments (250 mt ha(-1) year(-1)), FPOM (96 mt ha(-1) year(-1)), particulate organic carbon (POC; 2.9 mt ha(-1) year(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen (0.96 mt ha(-1) year(-1)), but was a source for dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 240 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), algal biomass (chlorophyll-a; 0.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and CPOM (21 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). Considerable quantities of DOC and algal biomass were exported to the river channel during phase II, whereas particulate matter transport was largely restricted to the short floods of phase III.7. The Danube Restoration Project will create a more gradual change between the individual phases by increasing hydrological connectivity between the river channel and the floodplain, and is predicted to enhance productivity by maintaining a balance between retention and export of nutrients and organic matter.Show less"

To investigate the potential removal of nitrate (NO3-) from surface and ground water sources, the spatial variations in dinitrogen (N-2) gas concentrations and direct measurements of sediment denitrification potential (DNP), with amended NO3- and carbon (C) treatments, were investigated in the summer along a 95-km reach of the San Joaquin River. Excess N-2 in hyporheic porewaters ranged from <0.1 to 8.65 mg L-1 and was significantly higher in porewaters from the 1.3 m (ground water source) versus 0.3 m (mixed surface and ground water) depths. In deep groundwater wells (3-7 m), median excess N-2 concentration was 5.39 mg L-1 (range = <0.1 -14.6 mg L-1). Excess N-2 concentrations were inversely correlated with dissolved oxygen and NO3- concentrations suggesting denitrification as an important process in the dominantly anaerobic sediments. Hyporheic porewater NO3- concentrations exceeded the detection limit of 0.01 mg L-1 in only 20% of the hyporheic porewaters, in spite of high NO3- concentrations measured in both surface waters (mean = 2.25 mg N L-1) and surrounding groundwaters. Sediment DNP rates averaged 253 and 297 mu g N kg(-1) hr(-1) for NO3- amended, and NO3- + C amended sediments, respectively, supporting the prevalence of denitrification in hyporheic sediments. Our results indicate that the hyporheic/riparian zones act as an anoxic barrier to nitrate transport from regional groundwater and as a location to remove NO3- from surface waters exchanging with the hyporheic zone.

In this study, various types of in-stream sill and deflector structures are described. A literature review including case studies, journal articles, and standards developed by various agencies suggests design guidelines which are currently available but do not meet the rigorous engineering-based hydraulic design criteria necessary for success. A practitioner opinion survey of personnel from state agencies, federal agencies, and private firms indicates that these structures are being used extensively in at least 76% of the USGS physiographic provinces. In general, respondents indicated that in the areas of cost, performance, maintenance, and environmental enhancement in-stream structures are preferable to the most common alternative: riprap revetment. Information from 39 case studies suggests that successful projects involve multiple structures and are located in rivers with relatively high aspect ratios.Show less"
49,"Harvey, JW",Aug 1996 ,Evaluating the reliability of the stream tracer approach to characterize stream-subsurface water exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream water was locally recharged into shallow groundwater flow paths that returned to the stream (hyporheic exchange) in St. Kevin Gulch, a Rocky Mountain stream in Colorado contaminated by acid mine drainage. Two approaches were used to characterize hyporheic exchange: sub-reach-scale measurement of hydraulic heads and hydraulic conductivity to compute streambed fluxes (hydrometric approach) and reach-scale modeling of in-stream solute tracer injections to determine characteristic length and timescales of exchange with storage zones (stream tracer approach). Subsurface data were the standard of comparison used to evaluate the reliability of the stream tracer approach to characterize hyporheic exchange. The reach-averaged hyporheic exchange flux (1.5 mL s(-1) m(-1)), determined by hydrometric methods, was largest when stream base flow was low (10 L s(-1)); hyporheic exchange persisted when base flow was 10-fold higher, decreasing by approximately 30%. Reliability of the stream tracer approach to detect hyporheic exchange was assessed using first-order uncertainty analysis that considered model parameter sensitivity. The stream tracer approach did not reliably characterize hyporheic exchange at high base flow: the model was apparently more sensitive to exchange with surface water storage zones than with the hyporheic zone. At low base flow the stream tracer approach reliably characterized exchange between the stream and gravel streambed (timescale of hours) but was relatively insensitive to slower exchange with deeper alluvium (timescale of tens of hours) that was detected by subsurface measurements. The stream tracer approach was therefore not equally sensitive to all timescales of hyporheic exchange. We conclude that while the stream tracer approach is an efficient means to characterize surface-subsurface exchange, future studies will need to more routinely consider decreasing sensitivities of tracer methods at higher base flow and a potential bias toward characterizing only a fast component of hyporheic exchange. Stream tracer models with multiple rate constants to consider both fast exchange with streambed gravel and slower exchange with deeper alluvium appear to be warranted.Show less"
