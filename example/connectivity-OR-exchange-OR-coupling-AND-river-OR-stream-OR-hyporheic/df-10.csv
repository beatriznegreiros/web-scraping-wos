0,"Shao, XJ",Nov 1 2019 ,River network connectivity and fish diversity,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Frequent and severe disruptions of natural river flows associated with human activities significantly alter hydrological connectivity in large river networks, with deleterious effects on fish diversity. Understanding the relationship between fish diversity and river network connectivity is fundamental to ensuring species persistence, ecosystem integrity, and human well-being. Here, we provide a review of the mechanisms by which river network connectivity (RNC) affects fish diversity. We review the relationships between forms, systems and types of RNC and fish diversity, based on more than 100 previous studies. In summary, sustaining RNC promotes fish diversity in longitudinal and lateral axes, and species sorting, dispersal dynamics, and habitat availability are the main factors driving the distribution of fish diversity, followed by nutrition and trophic dynamics. Our work highlights the effects of RNC on fish diversity, and provides a mechanistic understanding of how RNC affects fish diversity across river basins, thus providing scientific guidance for protecting fish biodiversity and improving the health of liver network ecosystems.

1,"Covino, T",Jan 15 2017 ,Hydrologic connectivity as a framework for understanding biogeochemical flux through watersheds and along fluvial networks,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Hydrologic connections can link hillslopes to channel networks, streams to lakes, subsurface to surface, land to atmosphere, terrestrial to aquatic, and upstream to downstream. These connections can develop across vertical, lateral, and longitudinal dimensions and span spatial and temporal scales. Each of these dimensions and scales are interconnected, creating a mosaic of nested hydrologic connections and associated processes. In turn, these interacting and nested processes influence the transport, cycling, and transformation of organic material and inorganic nutrients through watersheds and along fluvial networks. Although hydrologic connections span dimensions and spatiotemporal scales, relationships between connectivity and carbon and nutrient dynamics are rarely evaluated within this framework The purpose of this paper is to provide a cross-disciplinary view of hydrologic connectivity highlighting the various forms of hydrologic connectivity that control fluxes of organic material and nutrients and to help stimulate integration across scales and dimensions, and collaboration among disciplines.

2,"Butturini, A",May 1999 ,Importance of transient storage zones for ammonium and phosphate retention in a sandy-bottom Mediterranean stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The ability of hyporheic sediments to exchange water and retain ammonium and phosphate in the Riera Major stream,North-East Spain, under different discharge conditions was measured by conducting short-term nutrient and chloride additions.2. The mean exchange coefficients from free-flowing water to the storage zone (k(1)) and vice versa (k(2)) were 0.82 x 10(-4) s(-1) and 7 x 10(-3) s(-1), respectively. The ratio of storage zone cross-sectional area to stream cross-sectional area (A(S)/A) averaged 2.8 x 10-2 and was negatively correlated with discharge (r = -0.85, d.f. = 13, P < 0.001).3. The percentage of hyporheic zone water which came from surface water varied as a function of discharge and hyporheic depth, ranging between 33% and 95% at 25 cm depth, and between 78% and 100% at 10 cm depth.4. The nutrient retention efficiency in the hyporheic zone at 10 cm depth measured as uptake length (S-wh) was less than 3.3 cm for ammonium and 37 cm for phosphate. Higher nutrient retentions were measured in the sediments at 10 cm depth than at 25 cm, indicating that near-surface sediments were involved more actively in phosphate retention than the deeper hyporheic sediments. The lack of ammonium at any depth of the hyporheic zone showed that ammonium was very rapidly taken up in the surfacial sediments.Show less"

The signal of these two end-members is often obscured by biological uptake and/or groundwater input in the river catchment. McMurdo Dry Valleys streams in Antarctica have no deep groundwater input, no connectivity between streams and no surface vegetation cover, and thus provide a simplified system for us to constrain the supply of dissolved silicon (DSi) to rivers from chemical weathering in a glacial environment. Here we report dissolved Si concentrations, germanium/silicon ratios (Ge/Si) and silicon isotope compositions (delta Si-30(DSi)) in Crescent Stream, McMurdo Dry Valleys for samples collected between December and February in the 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017 austral seasons. The delta(30)Si(DSi)compositions and DSi concentrations are higher than values reported in wet-based glacial meltwaters, and form a narrow cluster within the range of values reported for permafrost dominated Arctic Rivers. High delta(30)Si(DSi)compositions, ranging from +0.90 parts per thousand to +1.39 parts per thousand, are attributed to (i) the precipitation of amorphous silica during freezing of waters in isolated pockets of the hyporheic zone in the winter and the release of Si from unfrozen pockets during meltwater-hyporheic zone exchange in the austral summer, and (ii) additional Si isotope fractionation via long-term Si uptake in clay minerals and seasonal Si uptake into diatoms superimposed on this winter-derived isotope signal. There is no relationship between delta(30)Si(DSi)compositions and DSi concentrations with seasonal and daily discharge, showing that stream waters contain DSi that is in equilibrium with the formation of secondary Si minerals in the hyporheic zone. We show that delta(30)Si(DSi)compositions can be used as tracers of silicate weathering in the hyporheic zone and possible tracers of freeze-thaw conditions in the hyporheic zone. This is important in the context of the ongoing warming in McMurdo Dry Valleys and the supply of more meltwaters to the hyporheic zone of McMurdo Dry Valley streams.Show less"
4,"Packman, A",Jul 2004 ,Hyporheic exchange with gravel beds: Basic hydrodynamic interactions and bedform-induced advective flows,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Stream-subsurface exchange processes are important because of their role in controlling the transport of contaminants and ecologically relevant substances in streams. Laboratory flume experiments were conducted to examine solute exchange with gravel streambeds. Two morphologies were studied: flat beds and beds covered by dune-shaped bedforms. High rates of exchange were observed with flat beds under a wide range of stream flow conditions, indicating that there was considerable turbulent coupling of stream and pore water flows. The presence of bedforms produced additional exchange under all flow conditions. The exchange with bedforms could be represented well by considering solute flux caused by bedform-induced advective pumping. Pumping exchange was enhanced by inertial effects, including non-Darcy flow and turbulent diffusion. For the flat bed case, dye injections showed that exchange also occurred by a combination of advective pore water flow and turbulent diffusion near the stream-subsurface interface. The relative effects of advective and diffusive transport processes could not be separated due to the complex nature of the induced flows in the gravel bed. However, exchange was found to scale with the square of the stream Reynolds number in all cases. Comparison of these results with those obtained with coarser and finer sediments demonstrated that the exchange rate is also proportional to the square of the characteristic bed sediment size. These scaling relationships can be used to,improve interpretation of solute transport observed in natural rivers.Show less"
5,"Varricchione, JT",Dec 2005 ,Vertical and seasonal distribution of hyporheic invertebrates in streams with different glacial histories,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"We investigated the vertical, lateral, and seasonal distribution of hyporheic invertebrates at five stream sites in Idaho (unglaciated areas) and seven sites in Montana (glaciated areas), U.S.A. Conservative tracer releases and transient storage zone analyses were conducted to help characterize study sites. Hyporheic invertebrates and substrate were sampled by freeze-coring with electro-shocking, and mini-piezometers were used to measure other hyporheic conditions, including vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG). Wells were installed at some Montana sites (range: 5-175 m lateral to the channel) and shallow pits were excavated at some Idaho sites (5 m lateral to the channel) to sample hyporheic invertebrates in these saturated sediments regions. Environmental conditions varied widely among sites and between surface and hyporheic zones at each site, and most hyporheic habitat measures differed significantly between glaciated and unglaciated streams. In-channel invertebrate density and taxa richness generally decreased with increasing depth into the streambed, regardless of geographic location, history of glaciation, or season. Although hyporheic invertebrate mean density and (to a lesser extent) richness values at individual depth layers (e.g., 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm) mostly were greater in the glaciated region than the unglaciated region, density and richness between 10-50 cm did not differ significantly between the two regions. Hydrologic variables (VHG; A(S)/A [ratio of transient-storage-zone- to channel- cross-sectional areas]; TTS [turnover time of storage]; and R-h [hydraulic retention factor]) provided the best explanation for differences in sub-channel invertebrate density and richness patterns. The observation that benthic invertebrates occurred in freeze-core, well, and open-pit samples contributes to existing evidence that aquatic invertebrates occupy habitats that extend considerable distances from the active channel.Show less"

7,"Larsen, LG",Jan 2014 ,Dynamic hyporheic exchange at intermediate timescales: Testing the relative importance of evapotranspiration and flood pulses,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic fluxes influence ecological processes across a continuum of timescales. However, few studies have been able to characterize hyporheic fluxes and residence time distributions (RTDs) over timescales of days to years, during which evapotranspiration (ET) and seasonal flood pulses create unsteady forcing. Here we present a data-driven, particle-tracking piston model that characterizes hyporheic fluxes and RTDs based on measured vertical head differences. We used the model to test the relative influence of ET and seasonal flood pulses in the Everglades (FL, USA), in a manner applicable to other low-energy floodplains or broad, shallow streams. We found that over the multiyear timescale, flood pulses that drive relatively deep (approximate to 1 m) flow paths had the dominant influence on hyporheic fluxes and residence times but that ET effects were discernible at shorter timescales (weeks to months) as a break in RTDs. Cumulative RTDs on either side of the break were generally well represented by lognormal functions, except for when ET was strong and none of the standard distributions applied to the shorter timescale. At the monthly timescale, ET increased hyporheic fluxes by 1-2 orders of magnitude; it also decreased 6 year mean residence times by 53-87%. Long, slow flow paths driven by flood pulses increased 6 year hyporheic fluxes by another 1-2 orders of magnitude, to a level comparable to that induced over the short term by shear flow in streams. Results suggest that models of intermediate-timescale processes should include at least two-storage zones with different RTDs, and that supporting field data collection occur over 3-4 years.Show less"
8,"Baxter, CV",Jul 2000 ,"Geomorphology, hyporheic exchange, and selection of spawning habitat by bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus)",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"The distribution and abundance of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) spawning were affected by geomorphology and hyporheic groundwater - stream water exchange across multiple spatial scales in streams of the Swan River basin, northwestern Montana. Among spawning tributary streams, the abundance of bull trout redds increased with increased area of alluvial valley segments that were longitudinally confined by geomorphic knickpoints. Among all valley segment types, bull trout redds were primarily found in these bounded alluvial valley segments, which possessed complex patterns of hyporheic exchange and extensive upwelling zones. Bull trout used stream reaches for spawning that were strongly influenced by upwelling. However, within these selected reaches, bull trout redds were primarily located in transitional bedforms that possessed strong localized downwelling and high intragravel flow rates. The changing relationship of spawning habitat selection, in which bull trout selected upwelling zones at one spatial scale and downwelling zones at another spatial scale, emphasizes the importance of considering multiple spatial scales within a hierarchical geomorphic context when considering the ecology of this species or plans for bull trout conservation and restoration.Show less"
9,"Liu, YY",Feb 7 2017 ,Coupled Hydro-Biogeochemical Processes Controlling Cr Reductive Immobilization in Columbia River Hyporheic Zone,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"An experiment and modeling study was conducted to investigate coupled hydro-biogeochemical processes controlling reductive immobilization of groundwater Cr in the hyporheic zone (HZ) at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site, where dynamic surface water groundwater exchange occurs on a daily basis. Experiments were performed to calibrate kinetic models, and the calibrated models were incorporated into a multicomponent reactive transport model to simulate Cr redox transformation and immobilization under field hydrological conditions. The results revealed that the rates of Cr(VI) reduction, Cr(III) accumulation, and Cr(VI) release to the river are mostly affected by dynamic sediment redox conditions represented by Fe(II) reactivity, which is controlled by its cyclic interaction with O-2 carried by river water, microbial activities, and the supply and bioavailability of organic carbon (OC) that is present in the HZ and/or carried by transport. In addition, the HZ geophysical properties including hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the top alluvial layer have a significant influence on Cr reactive transport and immobilization by controlling residence times for reactions and the supply rates of O-2, Cr, and OC into the HZ. The results provide important insights into the dynamic redox environments in the HZ that can reductively immobilize contaminants.Show less"
10,"Cheng, FY",Jun 2021 ,"Nevertheless, They Persisted: Can Hyporheic Zones Increase the Persistence of Estrogens in Streams?",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The presence of estrogens has been linked to adverse ecological effects in surface waters downstream of agricultural and domestic wastewater sources. While laboratory studies suggest that these estrogens should not persist because of fast degradation rates, elevated concentrations in surface waters impacted by agricultural activities are commonly observed. Using a combination of measured data and a stream-hyporheic zone (HZ) model applied to a 100 km reach in a tile-drained catchment, we show that the HZ can increase the persistence of estrogens. Field data reveal high concentrations of sorbed estrogens in sediments and elevated in-stream concentrations during low-flow summer months, suggesting that the HZ acts as a source of estrogens when transport into the streams is minimal. Model results provide further insight into the underlying mechanisms that enable sustained estrogen concentrations in streams, with the HZ acting as a source of dissolved estrogens for 95% of the year. We show that stream water interactions with the HZ may lead to overall suppression of degradation processes and an increase in the persistence of estrogens. Results suggest that when the model considered exchange in the HZ, approximately 28%-49% of estrogen mass remained in the stream ecosystem, while all estrogen mass was degraded in a 100-km reach in the model without the HZ. The remaining mass increased with increasing estrogen sorption coefficient, and this would potentially increase the lag time for lowering estrogen concentrations in surface water bodies even when inputs have ceased. Our findings highlight the importance of including HZ dynamics in estrogen transport models.Show less"
11,"Zachara, JM",Feb 2020 ,Kilometer-Scale Hydrologic Exchange Flows in a Gravel Bed River Corridor and Their Implications to Solute Migration,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A well-characterized field site along a major, gravel bed river corridor was used to investigate the dynamic pathways and impacts of subsurface hydrogeologic structure on kilometer-scale hydrologic exchange flows between river water and groundwater. An aqueous uranium (U-aq) plume exists within a hyporheic alluvial aquifer at the site that discharges to the Columbia River. We performed temporally intensive monitoring of specific conductance (SpC) and U-aq concentrations within the plume for a 2-year period at varying distances from the river shoreline, both within and outside a presumed subsurface pathway of lateral hydrologic exchange. SpC and U-aq were utilized as in situ tracers of hydrologic exchange and associated groundwater-surface water mixing. Seasonal river stage variations by more than 2 m caused distinct events of river water intrusion and retreat from the nearshore, hyporheic alluvial aquifer, resulting in highly dynamic SpC and U-aq patterns in monitoring wells. Simulations of hydrologic exchange and mixing were performed with PFLOTRAN to understand the observed SpC and U-aq behaviors linked to predominant flow directions and velocities in the river corridor as influenced by river stage dynamics and variable aquitard topography. By coupling robust monitoring with numerical flow and transport modeling, we demonstrate complicated multidirectional flow behaviors at the kilometer scale that strongly influenced plume dynamics. Therefore, hyporheic aquifer must be frequently monitored under different flow conditions if water quality is of concern. The resulting hydrologic understanding enables improved interpretation of hydrogeochemical data from this site and other large gravel bed river corridors in the United States and elsewhere.Show less"
12,"Mojarrad, BB",Feb 2019 ,Fragmentation of the Hyporheic Zone Due to Regional Groundwater Circulation,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"By use of numerical modeling and field observations, this work quantified the effects of catchment-scale upwelling groundwater on the hyporheic (below stream) fluxes over a wide range of spatial scales. A groundwater flow model was developed that specifically accounted for the hydrostatic and dynamic head fluctuations induced by the streambed topography. Although the magnitudes and relative importance of these streambed-induced fluxes were found to be highly sensitive to site-specific hydromorphological properties, we showed that streambed topographic structures exert a predominant control on the magnitude of hyporheic exchange fluxes in a Swedish boreal catchment. The magnitude of the exchange intensity evaluated at the streambed interface was found to be dominated by the streambed-induced hydraulic head across stream order. However, the catchment-scale groundwater flow field substantially affected the distribution of groundwater discharge points and thus decreased the fragmentation of the hyporheic zone, specifically by shifting the cumulative density function toward larger areas of coherent upwelling at the streambed interface. This work highlights the spectrum of spatial scales affecting the surface water-groundwater exchange patterns and resolves the roles of key mechanisms in controlling the fragmentation of the hyporheic zone.Show less"
13,"Dick, JJ",Jun 2018 ,Role of riparian wetlands and hydrological connectivity in the dynamics of stream thermal regimes,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,"Stream temperature is a fundamental physical characteristic of rivers, influencing biological productivity and water quality. Given the implications of climate warming for stream thermal regimes, it is an important consideration in river management plans. Energy exchanges at the water-air interface, channel geomorphology, riparian vegetation and advective heat transport from the different sources of discharge can all influence stream temperature. A simple mixing equation was used to investigate heat transport and to estimate daily mean and maximum stream temperatures on the basis of mixing groundwater and near-surface flows from riparian wetlands as end-members in a peatland catchment. The resulting data were evaluated against energy balance components and saturation extent to investigate the importance of riparian wetlands in determining stream temperatures. Data fit was generally good in periods with extensive saturation and poorest in dry periods with less hydrological connectivity, when reduced saturation and low flows increased the relative influence of energy exchange at the stream-atmosphere interface. These findings have implications in terms of climate change and land management, where the planting of riparian buffer strips to moderate water temperatures may be less effective when saturation area is extensive and hydrological connectivity is high.Show less"
14,"Briggs, MA",Jun 2013 ,"Relating hyporheic fluxes, residence times, and redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes upstream of beaver dams",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Small dams enhance the development of patchy microenvironments along stream corridors by trapping sediment and creating complex streambed morphologies. This patchiness drives intricate hyporheic flux patterns that govern the exchange of O-2 and redox-sensitive solutes between the water column and the stream bed. We used multiple tracer techniques, naturally occurring and injected, to evaluate hyporheic flow dynamics and associated biogeochemical cycling and microbial reactivity around 2 beaver dams in Wyoming (USA). High-resolution fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing was used to collect temperature data over 9 vertical streambed profiles and to generate comprehensive vertical flux maps using 1-dimensional (1-D) heat-transport modeling. Coincident with these locations, vertical profiles of hyporheic water were collected every week and analyzed for dissolved O2, pH, dissolved organic C, and several conservative and redox-sensitive solutes. In addition, hyporheic and net stream aerobic microbial reactivity were analyzed with a constant-rate injection of the biologically sensitive resazurin (Raz) smart tracer. The combined results revealed a heterogeneous system with rates of downwelling hyporheic flow organized by morphologic unit and tightly coupled to the redox conditions of the subsurface. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the variability of all redox-sensitive species, and results indicated that hyporheic water varied from oxic-stream-like to anoxic-reduced in direct response to the hydrodynamic conditions and associated residence times. The anaerobic transition threshold predicted by the mean O-2 Damko ""hler number seemed to overestimate the actual transition as indicated by multiple secondary electron acceptors, illustrating the gradient nature of anaerobic transition. Temporal flux variability in low-flux morphologies generated a much greater range in hyporheic redox conditions compared to high-flux zones, and chemical responses to changing flux rates were consistent with those predicted from the empirical relationship between redox condition and residence time. The Raz tracer revealed that hyporheic flow paths have strong net aerobic respiration, particularly at higher residence time, but this reactive exchange did not affect the net stream signal at the reach scale.Show less"
15,"Trauth, N",Jan 2017 ,Single discharge events increase reactive efficiency of the hyporheic zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In this study, we investigate the impact of single stream discharge events on water exchange, solute transport, and reactions in the hyporheic zone below a natural in-stream gravel bar. We set up a reactive transport groundwater model with streamflow scenarios that vary by event duration and peak discharge. A steady ambient groundwater flow field is assumed that results in losing, neutral, or gaining stream conditions depending on the stream stage. Across the streambed dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, and nitrate are transported into the subsurface. Additional nitrate is received from upwelling groundwater. Aerobic respiration and denitrification are simulated for scenarios with different stream solute concentrations. Results show that hyporheic exchange flux, solute transport, and consumption increase during events. However, their intensities depend highly on the interplay between event characteristics and ambient groundwater conditions. During events where reversals in the hydraulic gradient occur stream water and solutes infiltrate deeper into the aquifer where they have more time to react. For those events, the reactive efficiency of the hyporheic zone (solute consumption as fraction of influx) for aerobic respiration and denitrification is up to 2.7 and 10 times higher compared to base flow conditions. The fraction of stream nitrate load consumed in the hyporheic zone increases with stream discharge (up to 150 mg/m(2)/h), but remains below the value under base flow conditions for weak events. Events also increase denitrification of groundwater borne nitrate, but groundwater nitrate flux to the stream decreases by up to 33% due to temporary gradient reversals.Show less"
16,"Ward, AS",Dec 20 2019 ,Spatial and temporal variation in river corridor exchange across a 5th-order mountain stream network,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Although most field and modeling studies of river corridor exchange have been conducted at scales ranging from tens to hundreds of meters, results of these studies are used to predict their ecological and hydrological influences at the scale of river networks. Further complicating prediction, exchanges are expected to vary with hydrologic forcing and the local geomorphic setting. While we desire predictive power, we lack a complete spatiotemporal relationship relating discharge to the variation in geologic setting and hydrologic forcing that is expected across a river basin. Indeed, the conceptual model of Wondzell (2011) predicts systematic variation in river corridor exchange as a function of (1) variation in baseflow over time at a fixed location, (2) variation in discharge with location in the river network, and (3) local geomorphic setting. To test this conceptual model we conducted more than 60 solute tracer studies including a synoptic campaign in the 5th-order river network of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, USA) and replicate-intime experiments in four watersheds. We interpret the data using a series of metrics describing river corridor exchange and solute transport, testing for consistent direction and magnitude of relationships relating these metrics to discharge and local geomorphic setting. We confirmed systematic decrease in river corridor exchange space through the river networks, from headwaters to the larger main stem. However, we did not find systematic variation with changes in discharge through time or with local geomorphic setting. While interpretation of our results is complicated by problems with the analytical methods, the results are sufficiently robust for us to conclude that space-for-time and time-for-space substitutions are not appropriate in our study system. Finally, we suggest two strategies that will improve the interpretability of tracer test results and help the hyporheic community develop robust datasets that will enable comparisons across multiple sites and/or discharge conditions.Show less"
17,"Briggs, MA",Jun 22 2010 ,Surface and hyporheic transient storage dynamics throughout a coastal stream network,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Transient storage of stream water and associated solutes is expected to vary along stream networks in response to related changes in stream hydraulic conditions and morphologic gradients. These spatial changes are relevant to a wide variety of processes (e. g., biogeochemical cycling), yet data regarding these dynamics are limited and almost exclusively confined to the general storage terms of transient storage models with a single-storage zone (1-SZ). We used a transient storage model with two-storage zones (2-SZ) to simulate field data from conservative solute injections conducted in a coastal stream network in Massachusetts to separately quantify surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS). Solute tracer additions were performed at basin-wide, low-flow conditions, and results were compared with respect to stream size. Strong positive relationships with reach contributing area indicated that the size of the main channel and the size and residence time in surface and hyporheic storage zones all increased from small to large streams. Conversely, longitudinal dispersion and the storage zone exchange coefficients had no consistent trends downstream. The influence of storage exchange on median transport time (F-MED(200)) was consistently large for STS and negligible for HTS. When compared to 1-SZ model estimates, we found that the general 1-SZ model storage terms did not consistently describe either STS or HTS exchange. Overall our results indicated that many zone-specific (STS and HTS) storage dynamics were sensitive to the combination of hydraulic and morphologic gradients along the stream network and followed positive trends with stream size.Show less"
18,"Bakke, PD",Feb 2020 ,Hyporheic Process Restoration: Design and Performance of an Engineered Streambed,WATER,"Stream restoration designed specifically to enhance hyporheic processes has seldom been contemplated. To gain experience with hyporheic restoration, an engineered streambed was built using a gravel mixture formulated to mimic natural streambed composition, filling an over-excavated channel to a minimum depth of 90 cm. Specially designed plunge-pool structures, built with subsurface gravel extending down to 2.4 m, promoted greatly enhanced hyporheic circulation, path length, and residence time. Hyporheic process enhancement was verified using intra-gravel temperature mapping to document the distribution and strength of upwelling and downwelling zones, computation of vertical water flux using diurnal streambed temperature patterns, estimation of hyporheic zone cross section using sodium chloride tracer studies, and repeat measurements of streambed sand content to document evolution of the engineered streambed over time. Results showed that vertical water flux in the vicinity of plunge -pool structures was quite large, averaging 89 times the pre -construction rate, and 17 times larger than maximum rates measured in a pristine stream in Idaho. Upwelling and downwelling strengths in the constructed channel were larger and more spatially diverse than in the control. Streambed sand content showed a variety of response over time, indicating that rapid return to an embedded, impermeable state is not occurring.Show less"
19,"Uzarski, DG",May 2004 ,The importance of hyporheic sediment respiration in several mid-order Michigan rivers: comparison between methods in estimates of lotic metabolism,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Metabolism was measured in four Michigan streams, comparing estimates made using a flow-through chamber designed to include the hyporheic zone to a 20 cm depth and a traditional closed chamber that enclosed to a 5 cm depth. Mean levels of gross primary productivity and community respiration were consistently greater in the flow-through chamber than the closed chamber in all streams. Ratios of productivity to respiration (P/R) were consistently greater in the closed chambers than the flow-through chambers. P/R ratios were consistently <1 in all streams when estimated with flow-through chambers, suggesting heterotrophic conditions. Maintenance of stream ecosystem structure and function therefore is dependent on subsidies either from the adjacent terrestrial system or upstream sources. Our results suggest that stream metabolism studies that rely on extrapolation of closed chambers to the whole reach will most likely underestimate gross primary productivity and community respiration.Show less"
20,"Branco, P",Oct 2014 ,Prioritizing barrier removal to improve functional connectivity of rivers,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"1. Freshwater systems are severely impacted by connectivity reduction due to the construction of dams and weirs. The breach of this longitudinal connectivity imperils freshwater fish species world-wide. There is thus an increasing need for numerical tools that help decision-makers correctly allocate resources to prioritize restoration actions.2. This study provides a methodology for prioritizing the removal of barriers. It is based on spatial graphs, which represent structural units as nodes and relationships between nodes as links, and uses habitat suitability modelling (Boosted Regression Trees) to weight nodes. To exemplify the application of this procedure, we used the Tagus River network and evaluated the impact of the dams (29 built between 1928 and 2004) on the occurrence of each of two fish species (Iberian barbel Luciobarbus bocagei - representing large potamodromous fish; and southern Iberian chub Squalius pyrenaicus - representing small water-column residents) and on the combination of both.3. Results show that dam construction on the Tagus was responsible for a 48.4-54.4% reduction in river connectivity for different fish species. Actions to promote connectivity in just seven of the dams would increase connectivity by 35.0-37.2%.4. The removal of a single barrier chosen through prioritization had a greater overall connectivity increase than the random removal of seven barriers.5. Synthesis and applications. The proposed prioritization method, using spatial graphs and habitat suitability modelling, makes it possible to model the impact of the removal or placement of an insurmountable barrier on the overall functional connectivity of a river network, facilitating resource allocation and minimizing the impact of new barrier implementation.Show less"
21,"Marmonier, P",Mar 2010 ,Relevance of large litter bag burial for the study of leaf breakdown in the hyporheic zone,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Particulate organic matter is the major source of energy for most low-order streams, but a large part of this litter is buried within bed sediment during floods and thus become poorly available for benthic food webs. The fate of this buried litter is little studied. In most cases, measures of breakdown rates consist of burying a known mass of litter within the stream sediment and following its breakdown over time. We tested this method using large litter bags (15 x 15 cm) and two field experiments. First, we used litter large bags filled with Alnus glutinosa leaves (buried at 20 cm depth with a shovel) in six stations within different land-use contexts and with different sediment grain sizes. Breakdown rates were surprisingly high (0.0011-0.0188 day(-1)) and neither correlate with most of the physico-chemical characteristics measured in the interstitial habitats nor with the land-use around the stream. In contrast, the rates were negatively correlated with a decrease in oxygen concentrations between surface and buried bags and positively correlated with both the percentage of coarse particles (20-40 mm) in the sediment and benthic macro-invertebrate richness. These results suggest that the vertical exchanges with surface water in the hyporheic zone play a crucial role in litter breakdown. Second, an experimental modification of local sediment (removing fine particles with a shovel to increase vertical exchanges) highlighted the influence of grain size on water and oxygen exchanges, but had no effect on hyporheic breakdown rates. Burying large litter bags within sediments may thus not be a relevant method, especially in clogged conditions, due to changes induced through the burial process in the vertical connectivity between surface and interstitial habitats that modify organic matter processing.Show less"
22,"Bencala, KE",Mar 26 2011 ,Rethinking hyporheic flow and transient storage to advance understanding of stream-catchment connections,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Although surface water and groundwater are increasingly referred to as one resource, there remain environmental and ecosystem needs to study the 10 m to 1 km reach scale as one hydrologic system. Streams gain and lose water over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Large spatial scales (kilometers) have traditionally been recognized and studied as river-aquifer connections. Over the last 25 years hyporheic exchange flows (1-10 m) have been studied extensively. Often a transient storage model has been used to quantify the physical solute transport setting in which biogeochemical processes occur. At the longer 10mto 1 km scale of stream reaches it is now clear that streams which gain water overall can coincidentally lose water to the subsurface. At this scale, the amounts of water transferred are not necessarily significant but the exchanges can, however, influence solute transport. The interpretation of seemingly straightforward questions about water, contaminant, and nutrient fluxes into and along a stream can be confounded by flow losses which are too small to be apparent in stream gauging and along flow paths too long to be detected in tracer experiments. We suggest basic hydrologic approaches, e. g., measurement of flow along the channel, surface and subsurface solute sampling, and routine measurements of the water table that, in our opinion, can be used to extend simple exchange concepts from the hyporheic exchange scale to a scale of stream-catchment connection.Show less"

However, streamflow transmission losses can vary significantly, partly due to spatiotemporal variations in streambed permeability. To extend our understanding of changes in streambed hydraulic properties, field investigations of streambed hydraulic conductivity were conducted in an ephemeral dryland stream in north-western China during high and low streamflow periods. Additionally, streamflow transmission losses were numerically estimated using combined stream and groundwater hydraulic head data and stream and streambed temperature data. An analysis of slug test data at two different river flow stages (one test was performed at a low river stage with clean water and the other at a high river stage with muddy water) suggested that sedimentation from fine-grained particles, i.e., physical clogging processes, likely led to a reduction in streambed hydraulic properties. To account for the effects of streambed clogging on changes in hydraulic properties, an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance during the slug test was considered to correct the estimation of streambed hydraulic conductivity. The stream and streambed temperature can also greatly influence the hydraulic properties of the streambed. One-dimensional coupled water and heat flux modelling with HYDRUS-1D was used to quantify the effects of seasonal changes in stream and streambed temperature on streamflow losses. During the period from 6 August 2014 to 4 June 2015, the total infiltration estimated using temperature-dependent hydraulic conductivity accounted for approximately 88% of that using temperature-independent hydraulic conductivity. Streambed clogging processes associated with fine particle settling/wash up cycles during flow events, and seasonal changes in streamflow temperature are two considerable factors that affect water infiltration in ephemeral dryland streams. Our results show that time series measurements of stream and sediment temperature and surface and groundwater head can be used to effectively determine the seasonal dynamics of streambed water exchange. Such combined heat and head monitoring at field sites is useful for calibrating regional surface-groundwater models. The results of this study may provide insights into hyporheic exchange in ephemeral dryland streams. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
24,"Yellen, B",Jul 15 2015 ,Hydropeaking induces losses from a river reach: observations at multiple spatial scales,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In humid regions, where gaining river conditions generally prevail, daily hydroelectric dam releases alter downstream surface water-groundwater interactions by reversing the head gradient between river and adjacent groundwater. Previously, it has been noted that artificial stage changes due to dam releases enhance hyporheic exchange. Here we investigate the regulated Deerfield River in northwestern Massachusetts at multiple scales to evaluate how changing downstream geologic conditions along the river mediate this artificial hyporheic pumping. Water budget analysis indicates that roughly 10% of bank-stored water is permanently lost from the 19.5-km river reach, likely as a result of transpiration by bank vegetation. An adjacent reference stream with similar dimensions and geomorphology, but without hydropeaking, shows predictable gaining conditions. Field observations from streambed piezometers and thermistors show that water losses are not uniform throughout the study reach. Riparian aquifer transmissivity in river sub-reaches largely determines the magnitude of surface water-groundwater exchange as well as net water loss from the river. These newly documented losses from hydropeaking river systems should inform decisions by river managers and hydroelectric operators of additional tradeoffs of oscillatory dam-release river management.

25,"Morris, MR",Sep 2010 ,Successional changes in soil and hyporheic nitrogen fertility on an alluvial flood plain: implications for riparian vegetation,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"In floodplain primary succession, vegetation colonizes nitrogen-poor alluvial deposits and fertility improves as soil nitrogen accumulates over time. It is generally assumed that vegetation assimilates the vast majority of its nitrogen from the soil; however, recent studies have suggested that the hyporheic zone also may be an important nitrogen source. We investigated the potential relative importance of hyporheic nitrogen by comparing fertility indices, specifically total (TN), dissolved inorganic (DIN), potentially mineralizable (PMN) and ion exchange resin nitrogen (IERN) in both soils and the hyporheic zone at early, mid and late succession stands on an expansive river flood plain. We also constructed mesocosms to assess growth of cottonwood cuttings with access to soil and/or hyporheic water. We found TN and PMN increased from early to mid succession in both the soil (to 10 cm) and hyporheic zone (in a 10 cm layer). While TN, DIN and PMN were an order of magnitude higher in the soil than in the hyporheic zone, IERN was higher in the hyporheic zone, indicating that subsurface flow through the flood plain may be important in delivering nitrogen to the root zone. However, even when flux was added to the hyporheic PMN pool, nitrogen availability in the hyporheic zone (in a 10 cm layer) was vastly lower than soil PMN (to 10 cm). Further, the instantaneous standing stock of DIN in the surface soil alone was about equal to the sum of the DIN pool, the mean subsurface flux and the PMN pool in a 10 cm layer of hyporheic zone. In the mesocosm experiment, cottonwood cuttings with access to both soil and hyporheic water grew fastest; however, they also had the lowest foliar nitrogen concentrations, indicating that this was not due to greater nitrogen availability. In the field, nitrogen content of cottonwood foliage increased along with soil (but potentially hyporheic as well) nitrogen accumulation during succession, suggesting the vegetation responded to increasing nitrogen fertility. We conclude that at least on a per unit-volume basis, the hyporheic zone probably provides little nitrogen relative to the surface soil, except on new alluvial bars that characteristically are nitrogen poor. Therefore, the hyporheic zone is probably a much smaller nitrogen source for mature forests relative to the surface soil unless the vegetation exploits a much larger volume of the hyporheic zone than surface soil.Show less"
26,"Fernald, AG",Jun 2001 ,"Transient storage and hyporheic flow along the Willamette River, Oregon: Field measurements and model estimates",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Transient storage is a measure of the exchange of main channel flow with subsurface hyporheic flow and surface water dead zones. Hyporheic flow, in which river water enters the channel bed and banks to reemerge downstream, promotes biochemical processes that are important for water quality and aquatic habitat. Previous studies have quantified transient storage and hyporheic flow on small streams but were not specifically developed to identify both of these processes over long reaches of large rivers. We studied transient storage on the eighth-order upper Willamette River, which flows through high-porosity gravel deposits conducive to hyporheic flow. We used main channel dye tracer studies and solute transport modeling to estimate transient storage on nine study reaches in a 26-km-long study area. We also took dye measurements within the transient storage zone to identify transient storage Bow paths. We obtained estimates of transient storage exchange coefficient, alpha (s) (mean equals 1.6 x 10(-4) s(-1)), and transient storage to main channel cross-sectional area, A(s)/A (mean equal to 0.28), that show that significant amounts of water follow flow paths with 0.2-30 hour transient storage zone residence times. Our dye measurements from the transient storage zone itself showed the occurrence of both subsurface and surface flow paths, confirming that hyporheic flow is an important component of estimated transient storage. We found that the two highest A(s)/A estimates were for reaches that spanned the only length of active main channel in our study area that is unconstrained and where the river can rework large gravel deposits. Much of the natural channel complexity that historically promoted hyporheic flow no longer exists on the upper Willamette River. River management targeting the ecological functions provided by hyporheic flow might best focus on restoring historic hydrogeomorphic processes for creating sites conducive to hyporheic flow.Show less"
27,"Cornut, J",Dec 2010 ,Early stages of leaf decomposition are mediated by aquatic fungi in the hyporheic zone of woodland streams,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Leaf litter constitutes the major source of organic matter and energy in woodland stream ecosystems. A substantial part of leaf litter entering running waters may be buried in the streambed as a consequence of flooding and sediment movement. While decomposition of leaf litter in surface waters is relatively well understood, its fate when incorporated into river sediments, as well as the involvement of invertebrate and fungal decomposers in such conditions, remain poorly documented.2. We tested experimentally the hypotheses that the small interstices of the sediment restrict the access of the largest shredders to buried organic matter without compromising that of aquatic hyphomycetes and that fungal decomposers in the hyporheic zone, at least partly, compensate for the role of invertebrate detritivores in the benthic zone.3. Alder leaves were introduced in a stream either buried in the sediment (hyporheic), buried after 2 weeks of exposure at the sediment surface (benthic-hyporheic), or exposed at the sediment surface for the entire experiment (benthic). Leaf decomposition was markedly faster on the streambed surface than in the two other treatments (2.1- and 2.8-fold faster than in the benthic-hyporheic and hyporheic treatments, respectively).4. Fungal assemblages were generally less diverse in the hyporheic habitat with a few species tending to be relatively favoured by such conditions. Both fungal biomass and sporulation rates were reduced in the hyporheic treatment, with the leaves subject to the benthic-hyporheic treatment exhibiting an intermediate pattern. The initial 2-week stage in the benthic habitat shaped the fungal assemblages, even for leaves later subjected to the hyporheic conditions.5. The abundance and biomass of shredders drastically decreased with burial, except for Leuctra spp., which increased and was by far the most common leaf-associated taxon in the hyporheic zone. Leuctra spp. was one of the rare shredder taxa displaying morphological characteristics that increased performance within the limited space of sediment interstices.6. The carbon budgets indicated that the relative contributions of the two main decomposers, shredders and fungi, varied considerably depending on the location within the streambed. While the shredder biomass represented almost 50% of the initial carbon transformed after 80 days in the benthic treatment, its contribution was < 0.3% in the hyporheic one and 2.0% in the combined benthic-hyporheic treatment. In contrast, mycelial and conidial production in the permanently hyporheic environment accounted for 12% of leaf mass loss, i.e. 2-3 times more than in the two other conditions. These results suggest that the role of fungi is particularly important in the hyporheic zone.7. Our findings indicate that burial within the substratum reduces the litter breakdown rate by limiting the access of both invertebrate and fungal decomposers to leaves. As a consequence, the hyporheic zone may be an important region of organic matter storage in woodland streams and serve as a fungal inoculum reservoir contributing to further dispersal. Through the temporary retention of litter by burial, the hyporheic zone must play a significant role in the carbon metabolism and overall functioning of headwater stream ecosystems.Show less"
28,"Cote, D",Jan 2009 ,A new measure of longitudinal connectivity for stream networks,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,"Habitat connectivity is a central factor in shaping aquatic biological communities, but few tools exist to describe and quantify this attribute at a network scale in riverine systems. Here, we develop a new index to quantify longitudinal connectivity of river networks based on the expected probability of an organism being able to move freely between two random points of the network. We apply this index to two fish life histories and evaluate the effects of the number, passability, and placement of barriers on river network connectivity through the use of simulated dendritic ecological networks. We then extend the index to a real world dendritic river system in Newfoundland, Canada. Our results indicate that connectivity in river systems, as represented by our index, is most impacted by the first few barriers added to the system. This is in contrast to terrestrial systems, which are more resilient to low levels of connectivity. The results show a curvilinear relationship between barrier passability and structural connectivity. This suggests that an incremental improvement in passability would result in a greater improvement to river network connectivity for more permeable barriers than for less permeable barriers. Our analysis of the index in simulated and real river networks also showed that barrier placement played an important role in connectivity. Not surprisingly, barriers located near the river mouth have the greatest impact on fish with diadromous life histories while those located near the center of the river network have the most impact on fish with potadromous life histories. The proposed index is conceptually simple and sufficiently flexible to deal with variations in river structure and biological communities. The index will enable researchers to account for connectivity in habitat studies and will also allow resource managers to characterize watersheds, assess cumulative impacts of multiple barriers and determine priorities for restoration.Show less"
29,"Palumbo-Roe, B",Jun 2013 ,The hyporheic zone composition of a mining-impacted stream: Evidence by multilevel sampling and DGT measurements,APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"The importance of the hyporheic zone in influencing stream solute loads and stream ecosystems has been increasingly recognised. The hyporheic zone physicochemical composition of a stream stretch of the Rookhope Burn, a tributary of the River Wear in the North Pennines, UK, affected by historical mining of Pb ore, was characterised at two contrasting flow and temperature regimes. Vertical element concentration gradients were obtained using multilevel samplers down to a depth of 40 cm below the water-sediment boundary. Additional in situ Diffuse Gradients in Thin films (DGT) measurements of surface water and pore water were obtained.Circumneutral pH and oxidising conditions characterised the hyporheic zone of the study reach, composed of coarse-textured bed sediments. The surface hyporheic zone (top 15-20 cm) was dominated by the chemistry of the overlying water, while interactions with the solid phase were important for some elements in the deeper section of the hyporheic zone.Manganese was attenuated in the hyporheic zone as shown by SEM analysis of Mn-rich grain coatings from the bed sediment. Fine resolution data obtained through the use of the DGT probe deployed in the sediment at one sampling location, showed localised loss in Mn and Zn concentrations at 1.5-4.5 cm below the water-sediment interface. There was clear evidence for hyporheic pore water enrichment in Pb, which was unaffected seasonally, while Zn was greater in the summer sampling. These temporal variations of the hyporheic zone composition warrant consideration when accounting for the contribution of disperse inputs to mining impacted catchments, highlighting the need for hyporheic zone studies taking into account differences in seasons.The significance of the observed sediment-scale hyporheic processes on the reach-scale geochemical mass balance was estimated by using surface water geochemical loading calculations. Water metal mass balance from four previous sampling events indicated a constant loss of Mn load, a continuous gain of Pb load and a more temporally variable loss of Zn load for a 700 m stream stretch which included the study site. These results closely agreed with the present observations at the stream bed sediment scale, supporting the importance of hyporheic dynamic solute exchanges in affecting surface water quality for the study stream.

30,"Kondolf, GM",Jan 15 2017 ,The social connectivity of urban rivers,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other riversfor hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation.The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers similar to 50 to similar to 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over similar to 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaldng in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity.In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
31,"Diebel, MW",Dec 2015 ,EFFECTS OF ROAD CROSSINGS ON HABITAT CONNECTIVITY FOR STREAM-RESIDENT FISH,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Road crossings can act as barriers to the movement of stream fishes, resulting in habitat fragmentation, reduced population resilience to environmental disturbance and higher risks of extinction. Strategic barrier removal has the potential to improve connectivity in stream networks, but managers lack a consistent framework for determining which projects will most benefit target species. The objective of this study is to develop a method for identifying and prioritizing action on road crossings in order to restore stream network connectivity. We demonstrate the method using a case study from the Pine-Popple watershed in Wisconsin. First, we propose a new metric for quantifying stream connectivity status for stream-resident fish. The metric quantifies the individual and cumulative effects of barriers on reach and watershed level connectivity, while accounting for natural barriers, distance-based dispersal limitations and variation in habitat type and quality. We conducted a comprehensive field survey of road crossings in the watershed to identify barriers and estimate replacement costs. Of the 190 surveyed road crossings, 74% were determined to be barriers to the movement of at least one species or life stage of fish, primarily due to high water velocity, low water depth or outlet drops. The results of the barrier removal prioritization show that initial projects targeted for mitigation create much greater improvements in connectivity per unit cost than later projects. Benefit-cost curves from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate potential projects within and among watersheds and minimize overall expenditures for specified restoration targets.

32,"Norman, FA",Apr 2014 ,Heat transport in hyporheic zones due to bedforms: An experimental study,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Heat transport in hyporheic zones is critical for many temperature-sensitive physical, chemical, and biological processes. It also plays a role in the energy balance of rivers. To complement previous theoretical studies, we investigated the effects of hyporheic flow due to bed topography on hyporheic thermal dynamics through flume experiments. Diel temperature cycles were imposed in the channel and propagation of temperature signals into the sediment was examined for three different bed morphologies (flat bed, pool-riffle-pool, and rippled bed), three-channel flow rates, and two sediment grain sizes. Results show that the downwelling upstream and downstream of the bedforms and upwelling focused near the crest caused substantial advective heat transport and distinct thermal patterns in the sediment, with downwelling zones reflecting most of the surface water diel thermal range whereas upwelling zones were more buffered. Increasing permeability and channel flow rates increased advective transport. The results corroborate previous theoretical models further showing that hyporheic flow distinctly affects thermal patchiness in sediment. The results also have implications for heat tracing using analytical models which work well for flow fields without pronounced divergence and convergence and minimal dispersion, features atypical of hyporheic flow.Show less"
33,"He, DK",Jan 2017 ,Hydrologic connectivity driven natural stream fish assemblages in mountain streams in the Yangtze River basin: implications for stream fish conservation in monsoonal East Asia,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The East Asian monsoon and related seasonal rain belts are assumed to be significantly variable at intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales, and largely determine the hydrology and ecological processes of the streams and rivers in this region. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation in fish assemblages and the relative importance of local habitat and regional landscape variables in two protected streams in the middle Yangtze River basin. We hypothesized that the stream fish assemblages in this area are strongly influenced by the monsoon climate, and display a spatiotemporal variation in response to changes of stream flow regimes and physical habitats. The results show that species richness and abundance varied with both season and stream size. The distance to the downstream confluence site was the top important environmental factor, followed by altitude and downstream link. The results suggest that the fish assemblages within this protected watershed are mainly affected by regional landscape variables such as longitudinal position and stream position, but less by local habitat variables including water temperature and habitat types. The study highlights the importance of tributary connectivity and continuity to stream fish diversity in this area, indicating that restoration activities should preferentially recover the connectivity between upstream and downstream.Show less"
34,"Lewandowski, J",Apr 15 2011 ,Fate of organic micropollutants in the hyporheic zone of a eutrophic lowland stream: Results of a preliminary field study,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Many rivers and streams worldwide are impacted by pharmaceuticals originating from sewage. The hyporheic zone underlying streams is often regarded as reactive bioreactor with the potential for eliminating such sewage-born micropollutants. The present study aims at checking the elimination potential and analyzing the coupling of hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and micropollutant processing. To this end, two sites at the lowland stream Erpe, which receives a high sewage burden, were equipped and sampled with nested piezometers. From temperature depth profiles we determined that at one of the sites infiltration of surface water into the aquifer occurs while exfiltration dominates at the other site. Biogeochemical data reveal intense mineralization processes and strictly anoxic conditions in the streambed sediments at both sites. Concentrations of the pharmaceuticals indomethacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, bezafibrate, ketoprofen, naproxen and clofibric acid were high in the surface water and also in the subsurface at the infiltrating site. The evaluation of the depth profiles indicates some attenuation but due to varying surface water composition the evaluation of subsurface processes is quite complex. Borate and non-geogenic gadolinium were measured as conservative wastewater indicators. To eliminate the influence of fluctuating sewage proportions in the surface water, micropollutant concentrations are related to these indicators. The indicators can cope with different dilutions of the sewage but not with temporally varying sewage composition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
35,"Ward, JV",Jan-jun 1999 ,Biodiversity of floodplain river ecosystems: Ecotones and connectivity,REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT,"A high level of spatio-temporal heterogeneity makes riverine floodplains among the most species-rich environments known. Fluvial dynamics from flooding pray a major role in maintaining a diversity of lentic, lotic and semi-aquatic habitat types, each represented by a diversity of successional stages. Ecotones (transition zones between adjacent patches) and connectivity (the strength of interactions across ecotones) are structural and functional elements that result from and contribute to the spatio-temporal dynamics of riverine ecosystems. In floodplain rivers, ecotones and their adjoining patches are arrayed in hierarchical series across a range of scales. At a coarse scale of resolution, fringing floodplains are themselves complex ecotones between river channels and uplands. At finer scales, patches of various types and sizes form habitat and microhabitat diversity patterns. A broad spatio-temporal perspective, including patterns and processes across scales, is needed in order to gain insight into riverine biodiversity. We propose a hierarchical framework for examining diversity patterns in floodplain rivers.Various river management schemes disrupt the interactions that structure ecotones and alter the connectivity across transition zones. Such disruptions occur both within and between hierarchical levels, invariably leading to reductions in biodiversity. Species richness data from the connected and disconnected floodplains of the Austrian Danube illustrate this clearly. In much of the world, species-rich riverine/floodplain environments exist only as isolated fragments across the landscape. In many large rivers, these islands of biodiversity are endangered ecosystems. The fluvial dynamics that formed them have been severely altered. Without ecologically sound restoration of disturbance regimes and connectivity, these remnants of biodiversity will proceed on unidirectional trajectories toward senescence, without rejuvenation. Principles of ecosystem management are necessary to sustain biodiversity in fragmented riverine floodplains. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
36,"D'Haen, K",Sep 1 2013 ,A sediment fingerprinting approach to understand the geomorphic coupling in an eastern Mediterranean mountainous river catchment,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"To understand the response of a river to anthropogenic disturbance, knowledge of the links between erosion, sediment deposition, and sediment export is crucial. Therefore, starting from field observations and connectivity proxies, a sediment fingerprinting approach using geochemical tracers was used to elucidate the subrecent sediment dynamics in the 264-km(2) Bugduz River catchment in SW Turkey. A topography-based connectivity index was used as a proxy for hillslope-channel coupling and stream power estimations as a proxy for the within-channel connectivity. Quantitative provenance information provides a link between potential sediment sources and the derived sediment currently stored within the fluvial system. Provenance signals from both contemporary river bed sediments (n = 144) and subrecent floodplain deposits (n = 28) provide more insight into the coupling of the hillslopes to the river channel and the coupling within the river channel itself. Furthermore, comparing the provenance signal with the areal extent of potential sediment sources upstream in the form of enrichment ratios sheds light upon the variation of the erodibility of the sources and the connectivity within the catchment. Results indicate that the valley gradient exerts an important control on the spatial variability of geomorphic coupling in the Bugduz catchment. Furthermore, different sediment sources (lithologies) show distinct sediment production rates. In addition to the observed spatial variability, coupling relations are characterized by an important seasonal variation, indicated by variable contributions of local and more distant sediment sources.

37,"Menichino, GT",Oct 2015 ,The effect of macropores on bi-directional hydrologic exchange between a stream channel and riparian groundwater,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Macropores and soil pipes in stream banks are common geomorphic features. Macropores and soil pipes that are open to the channel (i.e. ""bank face-connected"" macropores) are inundated when channel stage is elevated (e.g., from precipitation, snowmelt, dam release). However, previous studies have not investigated macropore impact on bi-directional water exchange between the channel and bank/riparian groundwater under variable hydrologic conditions. We monitored two transects of riparian groundwater wells perpendicular to the bank of a 2nd order stream for a year: one with bank face-connected macropores (M transect) and one without bank face-connected macropores (NM transect). Fluctuations in water level and temperature during storms in those wells closest to the channel were on average 139% and 29% higher, respectively, in the presence of macropores. Rising head tests in the same wells indicated that hydraulic conductivity was 61-140 times higher in the presence of macropores. Bank storage, indicated by gradient reversals between channel and riparian zone, occurred on two temporal scales. Bank storage during storms was more frequent in the M transect (occurred all year) than in the NM transect (occurred just in winter and spring). Smaller magnitude gradient reversals at the M transect are consistent with faster head equilibration and greater exchange volume. Bank storage also occurred on an annual basis, with channel water entering storage during summer and fall and returning to the channel during winter and spring. Taken together, these results suggest that macropores act as preferential flow paths that enhance the connectivity between channels and riparian groundwater that influences bank storage. Where bank macropores are present, conceptual models of hyporheic and groundwater flow should account for their effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
38,"Kasahara, T",Jan 2006 ,Effects of riffle-step restoration on hyporheic zone chemistry in N-rich lowland streams,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Stream restoration projects that aim to rehabilitate ecosystem health have not considered surface-subsurface linkages, although stream water and groundwater interaction has an important role in sustaining stream ecosystem functions. The present study examined the effect of constructed riffles and a step on hyporheic exchange flow and chemistry in restored reaches of several N-rich agricultural and urban streams in southern Ontario. Hydrometric data collected from a network of piezometers and conservative tracer releases indicated that the constructed riffles and steps were effective in inducing hyporheic exchange. However, despite the use of cobbles and boulders in the riffle construction, high stream dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were depleted rapidly with depth into the hyporheic zones. Differences between observed and predicted nitrate concentrations based on conservative ion concentration patterns indicated that these hyporheic zones were also nitrate sinks. Zones of low hydraulic conductivity and the occurrence of interstitial fines in the restored cobble-boulder layers suggest that siltation and clogging of the streambed may reduce the downwelling of oxygen- and nitrate-rich stream water. Increases in streambed DO levels and enhancement of habitat for hyporheic fauna that result from riffle-step construction projects may only be temporary in streams that receive increased sediment and nutrient inputs from urban areas and croplands.Show less"

These bends often create the conditions for a hyporheic zone, which has been recognized as a critical component of stream ecosystems. The streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v), vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and Darcian flux (DF) in the hyporheic zone were estimated at 61 locations along a channel bend of the Beiluo River during July 2015 and January 2016. All the streambed attributes showed great spatial variability along the channel bend. Both upward fluxes and downward fluxes occurred during the two test periods, most of studied stream sections were controlled by downwelling, indicating stream water discharge into the subsurface. The average downward flux was higher at the downstream side than at the upstream side of the channel bend, especially in July 2015. The distribution of streambed sediment grain size has a significant influence on the variability of K-v; high percentages of silt and clay sediments generally lead to low K-v values. Higher K-v at the depositional left bank at the upstream site shifted toward the erosional right bank at the downstream site, with K-v values positively correlated with the water depth. This study suggested that the variabilities of K-v and VHG were influenced by the stream geomorphology and that the distribution of K-v was inversely related, to a certain extent, to the distribution of VHG across the channel bend. K-v and VHG were found to have opposite effects on the DF, and the close relationship between K-v and DF indicated that the water fluxes were mainly controlled by K-v.Show less"
41,"Cornut, J",Dec 1 2012 ,Effect of acidification on leaf litter decomposition in benthic and hyporheic zones of woodland streams,WATER RESEARCH,"Anthropogenic acidification has deleterious effects on both structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. This study examined how it may affect the leaf decomposition rate and the community structure and activity of decomposers in both benthic and hyporheic zones of five headwater streams along an acidification gradient from highly acidic (pH 4.6) to circumneutral (pH 7.4). Overall, responses to acidification in hyporheic zones were less pronounced, but followed the same pattern as in their benthic counterparts. Leaf decomposition was much faster in the circumneutral stream, both in the hyporheic and benthic zones (k = 0.0068 and 0.0534 d(-1), respectively), than in the most acidic one (k = 0.0016 and 0.0055 d(-1), respectively), and correlated well with the acidic gradient in both compartments. Interestingly, leaf litter decomposition was less affected by acidification in hyporheic compared to benthic compartments, likely due to the relatively low sensitivity of fungi, which were the main decomposers of buried coarse particulate organic matter. These results argue in favour of conserving hyporheic habitats in acidified streams as they can maintain matter and species fluxes that are essential to the ecosystem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

42,"Brunke, M",Feb 1997 ,The ecological significance of exchange processes between rivers and groundwater,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. This review focuses on the connectivity between river and groundwater ecosystems, viewing them as linked components of a hydrological continuum. Ecological processes that maintain the integrity of both systems and those that are mediated by their ecotones are evaluated.2. The hyporheic zone, as the connecting ecotone, shows diverse gradients. Thus it can be characterized by hydrological, chemical, zoological and metabolic criteria. However, the characteristics of the hyporheic zone tend to vary widely in space and time as well as from system to system. The exact limits are difficult to designate and the construction of static concepts is inadequate for the representation of ecological processes. The hyporheic interstices are functionally a part of both the fluvial and groundwater ecosystems.3. The permeability of the ecotone depends on the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment layers which, because of their heterogeneity, form many flowpath connections between the stream and the catchment, from the small scale of a single microhabitat to the large scale of an entire alluvial aquifer. Local up- and downwellings are determined by geomorphologic features such as streambed topography, whereas large-scale exchange processes are determined mainly by the geological properties of the catchment. Colmation--clogging of the top layer of the channel sediments--includes all processes leading to a reduction of pore volume, consolidation of the sediment matrix, and decreased permeability of the stream bed. Consequently, colmation can hinder exchange processes between surface water and groundwater.4. Physicochemical gradients in the interstices result from several processes: (i) hyporheic flow pattern and the different properties of surface and groundwaters; (ii) retention, caused by the filtering effect of pore size and lithologic sorption as well as the transient storage of solutes caused by diminished water velocities; (iii) biogeochemical transformations in conjunction with local residence time. Each physicochemical parameter may develop its own vertical dynamics laterally from the active channel into the banks as well as longitudinally because of geomorphologic changes.5. The river-groundwater interface can act as a source or sink for dissolved organic matter, depending on the volume and direction of flow, dissolved organic carbon concentrations and biotic activity. Interstitial storage of particulate organic matter is influenced mainly by grain size distribution and by spates involving bedload movement that may import or release matter, depending on the season. After initial transient and abiotic storage, hyporheic organic matter is mobilized and transformed by the biota. Micro-organisms account for over 90% of the community respiration. In subterranean waters most bacteria are attached to surfaces and remain in a biofilm.6. Hyporheic interstices are functionally significant for phreatic and riverine metazoans because they act as a refuge against adverse conditions. The net flow direction exerts a dominant influence on interstitial colonization, but many other factors also seem to be important in structuring the hyporheos.7. The hyporheic corridor concept emphasizes connectivity and interactions between subterranean and surface flow on an ecosystem level for floodplain rivers. It is a complementary concept to others which focus on surficial processes in the lateral and longitudinal dimensions.8. The ecological integrity of groundwater and fluvial systems is often threatened by human activities: (i) by reducing connectivity; (ii) by altering exchange processes; and (iii) by toxic or organic contamination.Show less"
43,"Jin, GQ",Mar 2022 ,Transport of Phosphorus in the Hyporheic Zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Phosphorus is not only an essential nutrient for organisms but also a major contributor to the eutrophication of fluvial ecosystems. Previous studies have focused on the flux of phosphorus at the water-sediment interface, and very little is known about the transport and distribution of phosphorus in bedforms. In this study, a series of flume experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate phosphorus dynamics in the hyporheic zone. The results show that the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water decreases faster than that of conservative solutes because of sediment adsorption. It is also found that the hyporheic exchange flux of phosphorus is more sensitive to the maximum adsorption capacity than to the equilibrium isotherm distribution coefficient, and the penetration depth is inhibited at higher maximum adsorption capacity. The mass proportion of phosphorus is decreased by 19.5% in the pore water but increased by 95.9% in the sediment with the increase of the maximum adsorption capacity from 0.5 to 1. These findings provide a better understanding of the transport and distribution of phosphorus in the riverbed and the contribution of transient flows such as flood to phosphorus dynamics in the hyporheic zone.Show less"
44,"Gandy, CJ",Feb 15 2007 ,Attenuation of mining-derived pollutants in the hyporheic zone: A review,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Mine water pollution is a major cause of surface- and groundwater pollution in former mining districts throughout Europe. It is a potential barrier to achieving good status water bodies, which is a requirement of the EU Water Framework Directive. In the UK, a concerted effort has been made over the last decade or so to address the scientific and practical challenges relating to the remediation of mine water pollution. However, most of this work has focused on remediation of point sources of pollution (typically arising from abandoned mines and shafts), while the behaviour of mine water at the groundwater-surface water interface (the ""hyporheic zone"") has received far less attention in relevant scientific and engineering literature. The extent of mine water pollution and capacity for its attenuation at the hyporheic zone has not been well quantified while, furthermore, the complex chemical and microbial processes occurring there (specifically with reference to mining-derived pollutants) have not been investigated in any depth. The absence of such data may relate, in a large part, to the difficulty in physically measuring volumes and concentrations associated with these river inputs/exports. A far greater body of literature addresses biogeochemical processes at the hyporheic zone (especially relating to manganese), albeit many such articles relate to aqueous metal dynamics in general, rather than mine water specifically. This paper presents a review of the natural attenuation processes that may limit the movement and availability of mining-derived pollutants at the groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interface, and specifically within the hyporheic zone. A substantial part focuses on precipitation and adsorption processes at the hyporheic zone, as well as discussing the role of microbial processes in governing metal ion mobility.

45,"Malard, F",Dec 2017 ,Geomorphic influence on intraspecific genetic differentiation and diversity along hyporheic corridors,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The hyporheic zone of rivers potentially acts as a dispersal corridor for ground-water organisms because it provides a spatially continuous interstitial habitat between isolated aquifers. Yet, the degree to which it can facilitate the movement of organisms has been hypothesized to vary in response to change in sediment regime, which determines channel morphology.2. In this study, we used microsatellite markers to test for a relationship between the genetic structure and diversity of the minute interstitial isopod Proasellus walteri and channel morphology along three nearby hyporheic corridors differing widely in their sediment regime. We predicted that genetic diversity would decrease and genetic structuring would increase as sediment supply-limited channels would become prominent features in the river corridor. The reason is that such channels have fewer and less suitable sedimentary habitats for migration because they lack large depositional bedforms such as gravel bars.3. Using genotypic data from seven microsatellite loci for a total of 713 individuals distributed among 25 demes, we found that demes had on average more alleles and were less differentiated in the river showing the most extensive alluvial deposits and shortest length of sediment supply-limited channels. Population clusters were also of greater size, reaching up to 30 km in length. The longitudinal pattern of genetic differentiation in this sediment-rich river was best explained by hydrologic distance and the longitudinal pattern of allelic richness was bell-shaped, as expected under a stepping-stone model with symmetrical migration.4. The length of sediment supply-channels was more important than hydrologic distance in explaining the longitudinal distribution of genetic differentiation in the two other corridors facing a sediment shortage. Allelic richness decreased monotonically upstream in the most sediment-poor river. This correlates with the expansion further downstream of sediment supply-limited channels in this river, which is likely to decrease animal movement and hence gene flow among demes.5. This study provides the first evidence that the degree to which the hyporheic zone facilitates the movement of groundwater organisms varies greatly among rivers of contrasted geomorphology. Extending the application of riverscape genetics across a range of interstitial taxa and geomorphic settings holds much promise for assessing the contribution of the hyporheic zone to the dispersal of groundwater organisms.Show less"
46,"Hughes, JM",Apr 2007 ,Constraints on recovery: using molecular methods to study connectivity of aquatic biota in rivers and streams,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The 'Field of Dreams Hypothesis' states 'if we build it, they will come', referring to the assumption that if habitats are restored, species will recolonise them. However, the ability of a species to recolonise a restored site will depend not only on the appropriate habitat being present, but also on the ability to get there. This is likely to depend on both the species' dispersal behaviour and the position of a site in the landscape.2. Animals with good potential for dispersal are more likely to be able to disperse to newly restored sites. Similarly, sites in lowland streams with limited altitudinal differences between sites may be easier to reach than upstream sites. This is because upstream sites are connected to one another via lowland streams that have different characteristics and therefore may be difficult for animals to traverse.3. In this paper, genetic data from a range of freshwater species that have been analysed in my laboratory are used to assess the importance of life cycle and position in the landscape (i.e. upland versus lowland streams) on connectivity patterns (and thus recolonisation potential) among populations.4. In general, contemporary dispersal across catchment boundaries is negligible, except for aquatic insects with an adult flight stage. Dispersal among streams within catchments appears to be more limited than was predicted from knowledge on life histories, except for fish in lowland rivers and streams.5. As predicted, dispersal of fish, crustaceans and molluscs among streams within catchments is significantly greater in lowland rivers than in upland streams.6. Overall, these analyses suggest that, with the exception of most insects, and fishes in lowland rivers, natural recolonisation of restored sites is only likely from sites within the same stream. If a species has disappeared from the whole stream, then restoration of habitat alone may not be sufficient for its re-establishment.Show less"
47,"Jonsson, K",Jul 25 2003 ,Hyporheic exchange of reactive and conservative solutes in streams - tracer methodology and model interpretation,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A transient storage model is evaluated using results from a tracer experiment, where a conservative and a reactive tracer (H-3 and Cr-51(III)) were injected simultaneously and monitored in stream water and bed sediment. About 76% of the chromium was lost from the stream water on the reach 30 km downstream of the injection point directly after the passage of the pulse in the flowing water. The bed sediment hosted the main part of the retained chromium. The time to washout 75% of the maximum solute uptake in the sediment was similar to 85 times longer for chromium than for tritium (i.e. similar to 45 days). It was possible to describe the sediment-water exchange with a diffusive flux formulation that could be evaluated using tritium breakthrough curves in the stream water or the tritium inventory breakthrough curves in the sediment. This experiment revealed further that observations of chromium concentrations in the sediment were essential for the quantifying of sorption properties, as it was not possible to catch accurately the time scale of sorption within the duration of the breakthrough curves in the stream water. There was a clear need for a rate-limited description of the sorption of chromium in the sediment. We found that a first-order kinetic description of the sorption process could acceptably describe the breakthrough curves in both the stream water and the bed sediment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

48,"Reeder, WJ",Jul 2018 ,Hyporheic Source and Sink of Nitrous Oxide,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas with an estimated 10% of anthropogenic N2O coming from the hyporheic zone of streams and rivers. However, difficulty in making accurate fine-scale field measurements has prevented detailed understanding of the processes of N2O production and emission at the bedform and flowline scales. Using large-scale, replicated flume experiments that employed high-density chemical concentration measurements, we have been able to refine the current conceptualization of N2O production, consumption, and emission from the hyporheic zone. We present a predictive model based on a Damkohler-type transformation ((tau) over tilde) in which the hyporheic residence times (tau) along the flowlines are multiplied by the dissolved oxygen consumption rate constants for those flowlines. This model can identify which bedforms have the potential to produce and emit N2O, as well as the portion and location from which those emissions may occur. Our results indicate that flowlines with (tau) over tilde (up) ((tau) over tilde as the flowline returns to the surface flow) values between 0.54 and 4.4 are likely to produce and emit N2O. Flowlines with (tau) over tilde (up) values of less than 0.54 will have the same N2O as the surface water and those with values greater than 4.4 will likely sink N2O (reference conditions: 17C, surface dissolved oxygen 8.5mg/L). N2O production peaks approximately at (tau) over tilde =1.8. A cumulative density function of (tau) over tilde (up) values for all flowlines in a bedform (or multiple bedforms) can be used to estimate the portion of flowlines, and in turn the portion of the streambed, with the potential to emit N2O.Show less"
49,"Dent, CL",Oct 1 1999 ,Modelling nutrient-periphyton dynamics in streams with surface-subsurface exchange,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Stream ecosystems include both surface and subsurface components that are connected by the flow of water. Processes occurring in subsurface sediments affect those in the surface, and vice versa. A model was developed to investigate the effects of nutrient transformations occurring in subsurface sediments on the growth of surface-dwelling periphyton. In the model the stream is divided into three zones: free-flowing surface water, a surface storage zone where flow is minimal and where periphyton growth occurs, and a subsurface zone. Parameters were based on information from Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a nitrogen-limited desert stream that has been extensively studied. The behavior of the model was examined both at steady state and as it approached steady state after periphyton biomass was reduced to low values, simulating the effects of a scouring flood. Previous work has shown that subsurface sediments are a source of inorganic nutrients, mainly nitrogen, to surface water and to periphyton communities in Sycamore Creek. Thus it was expected that in this model, periphyton biomass would increase when exchange between surface and subsurface zones was increased, and biomass would also increase when the rate of nutrient transformation in subsurface sediments was increased. Model results confirmed the expectations and highlighted the important role of organic nitrogen in mediating the periphyton-nutrient feedback. Post-flood recovery of periphyton biomass was particularly sensitive to elevated concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in flood water. The model shows that processes in the subsurface zone can have a large effect on surface organisms, and illustrates how surface periphyton communities interact with subsurface microorganisms through the recycling of nutrients.
