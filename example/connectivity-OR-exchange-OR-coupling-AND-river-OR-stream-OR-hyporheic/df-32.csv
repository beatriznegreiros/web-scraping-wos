1,"Raeymaekers, JAM",Aug 2008 ,Modeling genetic connectivity in sticklebacks as a guideline for river restoration,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,"Estimating genetic connectivity in disturbed riverine landscapes is of key importance for river restoration. However, few species of the disturbed riverine fauna may provide a detailed and basin-wide picture of the human impact on the population genetics of riverine organisms. Here we used the most abundant native fish, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.), to detect the geographical determinants of genetic connectivity in the eastern part of the Scheldt basin in Belgium. Anthropogenic structures came out as the strongest determinant of population structure, when evaluated against a geographically well-documented baseline model accounting for natural effects. These barriers not only affected genetic diversity, but they also controlled the balance between gene flow and genetic drift, and therefore may crucially disrupt the population structure of sticklebacks. Landscape models explained a high percentage of variation (allelic richness: adjusted R(2) = 0.78; pairwise F(ST): adjusted R(2) = 0.60), and likely apply to other species as well. River restoration and conservation genetics may highly benefit from riverine landscape genetics, including model building, the detection of outlier populations, and a specific test for the geographical factors controlling the balance between gene flow and genetic drift.Show less"
2,"Hart, DR",Jul 1999 ,Relationships between hydraulic parameters in a small stream under varying flow and seasonal conditions,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Twenty conservative tracer injections were carried, out in the same reach of a small woodland stream in order to determine how variation in discharge and leaf accumulation affect stream hydraulic parameters. The injections were made at various discharge rates ranging from 2.6 to 40 l/s. Five of the injections were made during late autumn, when there were large accumulations of leaves in the stream. Estimates of hydraulic parameters were made by fitting a transient storage solute transport model to conservative tracer concentration profiles. Velocity increased almost linearly with increasing discharge, indicating a decline in the Darcy friction factor. Dispersion also increased with increasing discharge, especially for the lower flow injections. The relative size of the storage zone was small (similar to 0.1). There was no definable relationship between discharge and the relative storage zone size, but the rates of exchange between the storage zone and the main channel increased markedly with increasing discharge. The presence of large accumulations of leaves had a clear effect on the hydraulic characteristics of the stream, producing much higher friction factors, larger storage zone sizes and lower velocity than would have been predicted by discharge alone.

3,"Poeppl, RE",Sep 2019 ,Combining Soil Erosion Modeling with Connectivity Analyses to Assess Lateral Fine Sediment Input into Agricultural Streams,WATER,"Soil erosion causes severe on- and off-site effects, including loss of organic matter, reductions in soil depth, sedimentation of reservoirs, eutrophication of water bodies, and clogging and smothering of spawning habitats. The involved sediment source-mobilization-delivery process is complex in space and time, depending on a multiplicity of factors that determine lateral sediment connectivity in catchment systems. Shortcomings of soil erosion models and connectivity approaches call for methodical improvement when it comes to assess lateral sediment connectivity in agricultural catchments. This study aims to (i) apply and evaluate different approaches, i.e., Index of Connectivity (IC), the Geospatial Interface for Water Erosion Prediction Project (GeoWEPP) soil erosion model, field mapping and (ii) test a connectivity-adapted version of GeoWEPP (i.e., ""GeoWEPP-C"") in the context of detecting hot-spots for soil erosion and lateral fine sediment entry points to the drainage network in a medium-sized (138 km(2)) agricultural catchment in Austria, further discussing their applicability in sediment management in agricultural catchments. The results revealed that (a) GeoWEPP is able to detect sub-catchments with high amount of soil erosion/sediment yield that represent manageable units in the context of soil erosion research and catchment management; (b) the combination of GeoWEPP modeling and field-based connectivity mapping is suitable for the delineation of lateral (i.e., field to stream) fine sediment connectivity hotspots; (c) the IC is a useful tool for a rapid Geographic Information System (GIS)-based assessment of structural connectivity. However, the IC showed significant limitations for agricultural catchments and functional aspects of connectivity; (d) the process-based GeoWEPP-C model can be seen as a methodical improvement when it comes to the assessment of lateral sediment connectivity in agricultural catchments.Show less"
4,"Wei, S",Aug 2022 ,A distributed domain model coupling open channel flow and groundwater flow to quantify the impact of lateral hydrologic exchange on hydrograph,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) of river-aquifer systems are known to affect water flow, but the quantitative influences of lateral HEFs and the riparian zone's hydraulic conductivity (K) distribution on stream fluxes remain obscure under varying hydrologic conditions. To fill this knowledge gap, this study proposed a physical based, distributed domain, coupled (open channel and groundwater) flow model (DDCM) to quantify the effect of lateral HEFs on hydrograph characteristics, including especially the peak discharge and tailing decay which are practically important. Numerical experiments showed that (1) the interaction between the lateral HEFs and river hydrodynamics reduced the peak discharge and flood flow rates, (2) a heterogeneous K field of the riparian zone generated multi-rate HEFs (which then changed flow response) represented by the hydrographs with various declining rates (varying from exponential to power-law), significantly expanding the flow process, and (3) the probability density function of K also affected the tailing and peak of the hydrograph. A preliminary test showed that the DDCM captured the overall pattern of hydrographs observed from a catchment in the Wadi Ahin West, Oman. This study, therefore, provided a model-based quantification of the mechanisms and factors of the lateral HEFs affecting the hydrograph pattern in flood events, and further applications are needed to test the applicability of the DDCM in capturing real-world hydrographs affected by the lateral HEFs.Show less"
5,"Tian, NX",Dec 2022 ,"Evaluation and Optimization of Hydrological Connectivity Based on Graph Theory: A Case Study in Dongliao River Basin, China",WATER,"Hydrological connectivity affects the material cycling and energy transfer of ecosystems and is an important indicator for assessing the function of aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, clarification of hydrologic connectivity and its optimization methods is essential for basin water resources management and other problems; however, most of the current research is focused on intermittently flooded areas, especially in terms of optimization, and on hydrological regulation within mature water structures, while research on hydrological connectivity in dry, low rainfall plain areas remains scarce. Based on the graph and binary water cycle theories, this study assessed and hierarchically optimized the structural hydrological connectivity of the Dongliao River Basin (DRB), integrating artificial and natural connectivity, and explored the hydrological connectivity optimization method in the arid plain region at the basin scale to increase connectivity pathways. The spatial analysis and evaluation of hydrological connectivity was also carried out based on the results of the hierarchical optimization, and provided three scenarios for the construction of hydrological connectivity projects in the basin. The hierarchical optimization yielded a total of 230 new water connectivity paths, and the overall hydrological connectivity increased from 5.07 to 7.64. Our results suggest a large spatial correlation in hydrological flow obstruction in the DRB. The center of gravity of circulation obstruction shifted to the south after optimization for different levels of connectivity. With the increase in the optimization level of hydrological connectivity, the national Moran index rose and then fell. The magnitude of the increase in hydrological connectivity effects varied at different optimization levels, and there were sudden points' increase points. From an application point of view, Scenario 1 is necessary and the most cost effective is Scenario 2, which provides a scientific basis for guiding the construction of future ecological projects in the DRB.Show less"
6,"Shuai, P",Sep 2017 ,"Denitrification in the banks of fluctuating rivers: The effects of river stage amplitude, sediment hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity, and ambient groundwater flow",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange induced by periodic river fluctuations leads to important biogeochemical processes, particularly nitrogen cycling, in riparian zones (RZs) where chemically distinct surface water and groundwater mix. We developed a two-dimensional coupled flow, reactive transport model to study the role of bank storage induced by river fluctuations on removing river-borne nitrate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantify the effects of river amplitude, sediment hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity, and ambient groundwater flow on nitrate removal rate. The simulations showed that nitrification occurred in the shallower zone adjacent to the bank where oxic river water and groundwater interacted while denitrification occurred deeper into the aquifer and in the riverbed sediments where oxygen was depleted. River fluctuations greatly increased the amount of nitrate being removed; the nitrate removal rate increased as river amplitude increased. Similarly, increasing hydraulic conductivity increased overall nitrate removal since it expanded the denitrifying zone but decreased efficiency. In contrast, increasing sediment dispersivity increased the removal efficiency of nitrate because it promoted mixing between electron acceptors and donors. The presence and direction of ambient groundwater flow had a significant impact on nitrate removal rate when compared to neutral conditions. A losing river showed a larger nitrate removal rate, whereas a gaining river showed a smaller nitrate removal rate. Our results demonstrated that daily river fluctuations created denitrification hot spots within the RZ that would not otherwise exist under naturally neutral or gaining conditions.Show less"
7,"Botter, G",Aug 2020 ,The Stream Length Duration Curve: A Tool for Characterizing the Time Variability of the Flowing Stream Length,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In spite of the importance of stream network dynamics for hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry, there is limited availability of analytical tools suitable for characterizing the temporal variability of the active fraction of river networks. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of Stream Length Duration Curve (SLDC), the inverse of the exceedance probability of the total length of active streams. SLDCs summarize efficiently the effect of hydrological variability on the length of the flowing streams under a variety of settings. A set of stochastic network models is developed to link the features of the local hydrological status of the network nodes with the shape of the SLDC. We show that the mean network length is dictated by the mean persistency of the nodes, whereas the shape of the SLDC is driven by the spatial distribution of the local persistencies and their network-scale spatial correlation. Ten field surveys performed in 2018 were used to estimate the empirical SLDC of the Valfredda river (Italy), which was found to be steep and regular-indicating a pronounced sensitivity of the active stream length to the underlying hydrological conditions. Available observations also suggest that the activation of temporary reaches during network expansion is hierarchical, from the most to the least persistent stretches. Under these circumstances, the SLDC corresponds to the spatial Cumulative Distribution Function of the nodes persistencies. The study provides a sound theoretical basis for the analyses of network dynamics in temporary rivers.Show less"
8,"Saleh, F",Apr 11 2011 ,Modeling the impact of in-stream water level fluctuations on stream-aquifer interactions at the regional scale,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The main objective of this study is to provide a realistic simulation of river stage in regional river networks in order to improve stream-aquifer interactions and better assess stream discharge and hydraulic head in aquifer units.The study focuses on the Oise basin (a 17,000 km(2) sub-basin of the Seine River basin, in Northern France). An upscaling method is proposed to benefit from high resolution hydraulic modeling at local scale to improve the simulation of river stages at regional scale. The methodology is based on simulation of the main rivers with a 1D Saint-Venant approach, from which functional stage-discharge relationships, are derived and projected onto each grid-cell of the regional model.At regional scale, the rating curves are used as boundary conditions and allow to calculate river stage, which is then used to calculate the exchanges between aquifer units and river. The approach is efficient to better simulate water pathways and stream-aquifer interactions at regional scale with low computing cost.The model was used to quantify stream to aquifer exchanges, that are in average 39 mm yr(-1) for aquifer to stream fluxes and 2 mm yr(-1) for stream to aquifer fluxes, mainly due to storage in aquifer units during storm events.

The watershed, which drains 76,000 km(2) , is heavily populated with 18 10(6) inhabitants and is thus submitted to large anthropic pressure. The offline coupling of two Reactive Transport Models is used to understand the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon, oxygen and nutrients and quantify the CO2 exchange at the air-water interface along the main axis of the river. The estuarine section of the Seine is simulated by the generic estuarine model C-GEM (for Carbon Generic Estuarine Model), while the upstream part of the network, devoid of tidal influence is simulated by the pyNuts-Riverstrahler modeling platform which also includes an explicit representation of the drainage network ecological functioning. Our simulations provide a process-based representation of nutrients, oxygen, total organic carbon (TOC) and the carbonate system (DIC and alkalinity) over the entire year 2010. Our coupled modeling chain allows quantifying the respective contributions of the estuarine and freshwater sections of the system in the removal of carbon as well as following the fate of TOC and DIC along the river network. Our results also allow calculating an integrated carbon budget of the Seine river network for year 2010.Show less"
11,"Atkinson, S",Jun 1 2020 ,"An inspection-based assessment of obstacles to salmon, trout, eel and lamprey migration and river channel connectivity in Ireland",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Knowledge of the location, physical attributes and impacts of obstades on river connectivity is a requirement for any mitigating action aimed at restoring the connectivity of a river system. Here, we present a study that recorded the numbers and physical diversity of obstades in 10 river catchments in Ireland, together with the impact these structures had on overall river connectivity. A total of 372 obstacles were recorded, 3 of these were dams, and the remainder were low-head weirs/sluices, obstacles associated with mad or rail crossings of rivers and natural structures. The degree of fragmentation was estimated in each catchment by calculating obstacle density and the Dendrific Connectivity Index (DCI). DCI scores were calculated for 4 native Irish fish species with different life-histories, namely diadromous (Atlantic salmon, sea trout, European eel, sea lamprey) and potamodromous (brown trout). Obstacle density ranged between 12 and 0.02 obstades/km of river. Six of the 10 catchments had at least one obstacle located on the mainstem river at least 5 km from its mouth/confluence. These 6 catchments typically had the lowest connectivity scores for diadromous species and ranged between 0.6 and 44.1 (a fully connected river would receive a maximum score of 100). While there was no significant correlation between obstacle density and the DCI score for diadromous fish, a significant negative correlation was detected between obstacle density and the DCI score for potamodromous brown trout Here, we highlight the merit of these obstacle assessments and associated challenges for decision-making relating to prioritisation of obstacles for removal or modification.

12,"Makrakis, S",Jul 1 2019 ,Hydropower Development and Fishways: A Need for Connectivity in Rivers of the Upper Parana Basin,SUSTAINABILITY,"South American rivers have become intensely affected by the construction of hydroelectric dams that block the river's connectivity for migratory fish species. In order to mitigate the problems caused by dams and to reestablish connections between habitats, fishways are implemented. Fishways are structures that aid fish in overcoming obstacles and help preserve migratory, reproductive, and feeding routes. This study performed an inventory of all hydropower plants-present and future-in the Upper Parana River, with the objective of identifying fishways unknown to scientific literature, as well as the task of mapping them. By doing so, the current situation of structural connectivity via fishways in the Upper Parana River Basin was described. Overall, 389 dams along 209 rivers were identified; of these, only 9% (35 dams) have fishways. In addition, an alarming explosion of future medium-sized hydropower plants was observed, with an expectation of an almost 500% increase in relation to those existing. This data reveals a trend of reduction of free-flowing river stretches, which are crucial habitats for Neotropical potamodromous species, and point to a deficiency in the structural connectivity of existing hydropower dams. Furthermore, if the implementations of these expected constructions are associated with limited connectivity as a result of the absence of fishways, the management of fisheries and their resources in the Upper Parana River may become unsustainable.Show less"
13,"Bellmore, JR",Jun 2014 ,EFFECTS OF GEOMORPHIC PROCESS DOMAINS ON RIVER ECOSYSTEMS: A COMPARISON OF FLOODPLAIN AND CONFINED VALLEY SEGMENTS,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The geomorphic template of streams and rivers exerts strong controls on the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. However, relationships between stream geomorphology and ecosystem structure and function are not always clear and have not been investigated equally across spatial scales. In montane regions, rivers often alternate between canyon-confined segments and unconfined floodplain segments. Yet, few studies have evaluated how this pattern influences aquatic ecosystems. Here, we compared five confined river segments to five paired floodplain segments in terms of allochthonous inputs, aquatic primary producer and invertebrate production, stream retentive capacity, and aquatic invertebrate community composition. We found that floodplains had a higher (up to 4x) retentive capacity, a greater richness (58%) of aquatic invertebrates, and a distinctly different invertebrate community, relative to confined segments. Contrary to our expectations, allochthonous inputs were approximately 2x greater for confined segments, and aquatic primary and invertebrate production exhibited no consistent differences between segment types. However, results did indicate that floodplains had greater overall community respiration than confined segments. Together, these findings suggest that floodplain and confined segments do indeed differ in terms of aquatic ecosystem structure and function but not entirely as expected. Confined segments had greater allochthonous inputs but a lower capacity to retain those inputs, whereas floodplains had a high capacity to retain transported organic matter and also a more diverse community of invertebrates and higher overall community respiration to digest' retained organic matter. If these findings are generalizable, then they would indicate that confined segments are sources for organic matter within river networks, whereas floodplains act as filters, removing and processing organic matter transported from upstream confined segments.

14,"Hall, RO",Nov 2009 ,"Hydrologic control of nitrogen removal, storage, and export in a mountain stream",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Nutrient cycling and export in streams and rivers should vary with flow regime, yet most studies of stream nutrient transformation do not include hydrologic variability. We used a stable isotope tracer of nitrogen (N-15) to measure nitrate (NO3-) uptake, storage, and export in a mountain stream, Spring Creek, Idaho, U. S. A. We conducted two tracer tests of 2-week duration during snowmelt and baseflow. Dissolved and particulate forms of N-15 were monitored over three seasons to test the hypothesis that stream N cycling would be dominated by export during floods, and storage during low flow. Floods exported more N than during baseflow conditions; however, snowmelt floods had higher than expected demand for NO3- because of hyporheic exchange. Residence times of benthic N during both tracer tests were longer than 100 d for ephemeral pools such as benthic algae and wood biofilms. Residence times were much longer in fine detritus, insects, and the particulate N from the hyporheic zone, showing that assimilation and hydrologic storage can be important mechanisms for retaining particulate N. Of the tracer N stored in the stream, the primary form of export was via seston during periods of high flows, produced by summer rainstorms or spring snowmelt the following year. Spring Creek is not necessarily a conduit for nutrients during high flow; hydrologic exchange between the stream and its valley represents an important storage mechanism.Show less"
15,"Taube, N",Mar 20 2019 ,"Phosphorus and nitrogen storage, partitioning, and export in a large gravel bed river",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Nutrient dynamics in a 25 km long treated wastewater effluent impacted reach of a large, gravel-bed river were evaluated in five river compartments: surficial sediment, surface water, hyporheic zone water, and aquatic biomass (including epilithic algae and macrophyles). Nutrient. storage within, and export from, the river reach, was quantified to assess the impact of WWTP effluent on nutrient dynamics.More than 98% of N and P storage was found in he surficial river bed sediment, where it is available to support epilithic algal and macrophyte growth. Nutrient export from the river reach by sediment, hyporheic water, and biomass were small compared to water column transport. The N:P ratios for the five different compartments suggested that the wafer column was severely P limited, whereas sediment, hyporheic water, and aquatic biomass tended towards co-limitation and N limitation.Within the river reach, he majority of P was stored immediately downstream of he WWTP effluent outfall, whereas N was retained at a higher rate relative to Pin the remainder of the reach. Correlation analysis of nutrient exchange between different compartments suggested that multiple nutrient compartments should be considered when establishing nutrient loading criteria. Nutrient analysis in multiple compartments in the river can add valuable insight into nutrient dynamics and nutrient limitation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
16,"Chaput-Bardy, A",Dec 24 2009 ,Modelling the effect of in-stream and overland dispersal on gene flow in river networks,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Modelling gene flow across natural landscapes is a current challenge of population genetics. Models are essential to make clear predictions about conditions that cause genetic differentiation or maintain connectivity between populations. River networks are a special case of landscape matrix. They represent stretches of habitat connected according to a branching pattern where dispersal is usually limited to upstream or downstream movements. Because of their peculiar topology, and the increasing concern about conservation issues in hydrosystems, there has been a recent revival of interest in modelling dispersal in river networks. Network complexity has been shown to influence global population differentiation. However, geometric characteristics are likely to interact with the way individuals move across space. Studies have focused on in-stream movements. None of the work published so far took into consideration the ability of many species to disperse overland between branches of the same network though. We predicted that the relative contribution of these two dispersal modalities (in-stream and overland) would affect the overall genetic structure. We simulated dispersal in synthetic river networks using an individual-based model. We tested the effect of dispersal modalities, i.e. the ratio of overland/in-stream dispersal, and two geometric parameters, bifurcation angle between branches and network complexity. Data revealed that if geometrical parameters affected population differentiation, dispersal parameters had the strongest effect. Interestingly, we observed a quadratic relationship between p the proportion of overland dispersers and population differentiation. We interpret this U-shape pattern as a balance between isolation by distance caused by in-stream movements at low values of p and intense migrant exchanges within the same branching unit at high values of p. Our study is the first attempt to model out-of-network movements. It clearly shows that both geometric and dispersal parameters interact. Both should be taken into consideration in order to refine predictions about dispersal and gene flow in river network. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
17,"Rajbanshi, J",Apr 15 2022 ,"Planform changes and alterations of longitudinal connectivity caused by the 2019 flood event on the braided Brahmaputra River in Assam, India",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"The longitudinal connectivity of rivers facilitates the downstream transfer of discharge and sediment. Any alterations to this component can potentially impair/block sediment movement, resulting in deposition and planform alterations. This effect is more enhanced in braided rivers, which usually convey large sediment volumes. In this study, we use Graph Theory to analyze the impact of a big flood event (July 2019 flood) on the channel planform configuration of the Brahmaputra River in the eastern Indian state of Assam. The inbetweenness centrality and structural sediment connectivity of the nodes (channel confluences/diffluences) and links were computed using different indices. The node accessibility was enumerated using the Shimbel Index. Sedimentographs were devised to simulate the likely sediment outflow volumes and its duration in the post-flood scenario. Our results reveal that significant changes in the channel planform were caused by this flood event, which repositioned mid-channel and bank-attached bar deposits and realigned the river's entwined multiple threads. These engendered alterations in the existing channel bifurcations and inter-node connections, thereby impacting on how the sediment was transferred and its pathways. The enumerated accessibility index and simulated sediment volumes reflected the above changes, with reach-wise variations apparent in these aspects. This study helps comprehend the flood-induced planform morphological changes in braided streams, which has implications for navigation. The framework used here can also be applied to assess other braided rivers.Show less"
18,"Dai, ML",Dec 2017 ,Impact of the Three Gorges Project operation on the water exchange between Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,"The Three Gorges Project (TGP) is a world known project to utilize and manage the water resources of the Yangtze River. The reservoir stores water at the end of the flood season, and replenishes downstream reaches with water in dry seasons. In addition to such benefits, the TGP has irreversibly changed the hydrological process and the river-lake relation of the middle and lower reaches. In this paper, a hydrodynamic model was established to quantify the impact of the TGP's operation on the water exchange between Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River during 2009-2013. The results indicated that: the operation of the TGP has considerably reduced the peak discharge and the flood volume of the main stream and the Dongting Lake area. The inflow volume from the Yangtze River to Dongting Lake via three outlets decreased by 1.9-3.5 billion m(3)/yr, while the outflow volume from Dongting Lake to the Yangtze River at Chenglingji increased by 0.3-1.6 billion m(3) in September and 0.4-0.6 billion m(3) in October, respectively. This research provides valuable information for flood control, irrigation, and water allocation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and serves as a typical case for investigating the impact of other hydropower projects around the world.

19,"Liu, SL",Jan 8 2021 ,Multi-Scale Ecological Connectivity Dynamics Associated With Hydropower Station: A Case Study in the Lancang River Valley,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Dam construction is a major threat to terrestrial ecological processes that exhibit spatial variation. As an effective indicator of species movements at large scales, the dynamics of forest landscape connectivity for the dispersal abilities of local species such as primates both upstream and downstream of the Manwan hydropower station were compared in three periods: before, during, and after dam construction (in 1974, 1988, and 2004, respectively). The equivalent connected area (ECA) index which was modified from the probability of connectivity (PC) index based on the graph theory was applied in this study. We used this method to analyze the spatial and temporal changes in the overall forest landscape connectivity due to dam construction. The results showed that forest connectivity decreased after dam construction. The forest connectivity upstream was much greater than that downstream in 1974 but was lower in 1988 and 2004. The importance of connectivity increased with increasing dispersal distance. Only 8, 12, and 18% of forest patches of small area exhibited changes in 1974, 1988, and 2004, respectively. Most of the large habitat patches (i.e., those with dECA values >50%) remained stable, and the greatest patch changes were found at a dispersal distance of 400 m in all three periods. These large forest patch changes often occurred near the boundary of the study area. The Betweenness Centrality indicator, which identifies patches as stepping stones while accounting for ecological processes and biological flows at a larger scale, indicated that some habitat patches near Manwan Dam acted as stepping stones in maintaining the forest connectivity. Furthermore, rank correlations between the forest patch area and the three dPC ((intra, flux, connector)) fractions indicated that the dPC(flux) indicator can be used to measure the prioritization of habitat patches.Show less"
20,"Shogren, AJ",Mar 1 2020 ,Controls on fine particle retention in experimental streams,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The transport and retention of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) in headwater streams plays a significant role in organic matter processing and represents a critical link between upstream and downstream systems. Benthic biofilms potentially alter substrate characteristics and dynamics. However, the influence of biofilm colonization on FPOM retention has not been well documented, likely due to inherent heterogeneity of natural systems. We expected that biofilm growth would either enhance or diminish FPOM retention in the streambed, whereas biofilm growth would vary depending on the underlying substrate template. We used a short-term FPOM addition technique to estimate transport distances of a fine particle analog (corn pollen: 70 mu m) in four 50-m experimental streams (Q = 1.5 L/s) at the Notre Dame Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility. Streams varied in substrate size (1-cm pea gravel vs 10-cm small cobble) and complexity (homogenous 50/50 mix vs alternating sections). We sampled streams on multiple dates over 5 mo (June-October) of biofilm colonization and senescence. While FPOM transport distances generally increased as biofilm colonization occurred, retention was variable across streams and over time. We found no consistent or simple pattern of FPOM retention in our streams. Rather, one of the strongest effects was an indirect relationship between FPOM removal and transient storage, a factor that is strongly driven by biofilm colonization. These results emphasize the dynamic feedback of the physical and biological environments influencing FPOM retention in streams.Show less"
21,"Cho, EB",May 2020 ,"Enhanced Exchange Flow During Spring Tide and Its Cause in the Sumjin River Estuary, Korea",ESTUARIES AND COASTS,"Knowledge of exchange flow and its variations is important, because it determines the distribution of salt, nutrient, pollutant, and suspended sediment in estuaries. Although exchange flow has been studied extensively, their variations over the spring-neap tidal cycle remain unclear. Many studies have indicated that the exchange flow is weaker during spring tides than neap tides, but others have reported that it might be stronger during spring tides. Therefore, we investigated the spring-neap variation of an exchange flow and its cause based on intensive observational data and an analytical model applied to the Sumjin River estuary (SRE), Korea. The observations revealed that exchange flow increased during the spring tide but decreased during the neap tide. The horizontal salinity gradient increased about seven times more during spring tide than during neap tide in the middle of the estuary. The analytical model implied that the exchange flow in the SRE is mainly driven by the horizontal salinity gradient. The large horizontal salinity gradient and tidal current amplitude ratio in the SRE between the spring and neap tides suggests that the horizontal pressure gradient driven by the salinity gradient overwhelms vertical mixing in driving exchange flow in the SRE.Show less"
22,"Cooper, AR",Feb 2016 ,Identifying indicators and quantifying large-scale effects of dams on fishes,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Although localized effects of individual dams on stream fish assemblages have been relatively well-studied, less is known about the effects of multiple dams within a stream network on fishes and the patterns that emerge when the combined effects of individual and multiple dams are viewed across entire river basins, ecoregions, and states. This study evaluated multiple stream network fragmentation metrics representing localized (e.g., distance-to-dams) and cumulative (e.g., total upstream reservoir storage) dam influences on streams in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, developing an approach for identifying suitable fish indicators of dam effects. We used change point and correlation analyses to determine associations of stream fish catch per unit effort and various stream network fragmentation metrics with data from more than 2000 fish survey sites stratified by stream size, thermal regime, and ecoregion. Of the identified indicator species, predominantly warmwater, large river, and/or lentic species were positively associated with stream network fragmentation, whereas cold and coolwater lotic species were negatively associated with fragmentation. These results suggest a combination of downstream thermal effects and upstream influences from impoundments generated by dams. Variance partitioning analyses based on identified indicator species revealed greater upstream-dominated dam influences in headwaters than mid-sized streams, and a greater relative influence of dams vs. other non-dam anthropogenic influences in cold streams than warm streams. Overall, a combination of localized and cumulative fragmentation metrics, as well as upstream and downstream-oriented measures, were influential in indicator species responses, emphasizing the importance of selecting a diversity of fragmentation metrics when assessing effects of dams on stream fishes. Understanding multiple dam influences on stream fishes, including localized effects from individual dams and cumulative effects from all dams within a river basin, would provide useful information for a variety of management activities, including dam operation and dam removal prioritization. Dams significantly affect conservation and management options for stream fishes, with identification of multi-scale dam influences on fishes being critical to restoration and maintenance of aquatic biodiversity throughout the world.

24,"Massicotte, P",Oct 2011 ,Spatial connectivity in a large river system: resolving the sources and fate of dissolved organic matter,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Large rivers are generally heterogeneous and productive systems that receive important inputs of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial and in situ sources. Thus, they are likely to play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of the DOM flowing to the oceans. The asymmetric spatial gradient driven by directional flow and environmental heterogeneity contributes to the fate of DOM flowing downstream. Yet, the relative effects of spatial connectivity and environmental heterogeneity on DOM dynamics are poorly understood. For example, since environmental variables show spatial heterogeneity, the variation explained by environmental and spatial variables may be redundant. We used the St. Lawrence River (SLR) as a representative large river to resolve the unique influences of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on DOM dynamics. We used three-dimensional fluorescence matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize the DOM pool in the SLR. Seven fluorophores were modeled, of which two were identified to be of terrestrial origin and three from algal exudates. We measured a set of environmental variables that are known to drive the fate of DOM in aquatic systems. Additionally, we used asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM) modeling to take spatial connectivity into account. The combination of spatial and environmental models explained 85% of the DOM variation. We show that spatial connectivity is an important driver of DOM dynamics, as a large fraction of environmental heterogeneity was attributable to the asymmetric spatial gradient. Along the longitudinal axis, we noted a rapid increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mostly controlled by terrestrial input of DOM originating from the tributaries. Variance partitioning demonstrated that freshly produced protein-like DOM was found to be the preferential substrate for heterotrophic bacteria undergoing rapid proliferation, while humic-like DOM was more correlated to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVA radiation.Show less"

The median value of seepage measured at 24 locations was 24 cm/day, but seepage measured at specific sites ranged from -340 to +237 cm/day. Seepage also varied substantially over periods of hours to days and occasionally reversed direction in response to evolution of the sediment bed. Vertical hydraulic conductivity was related to seepage direction and was larger during upward seepage than during downward seepage; with differences ranging from 4 to 40% in areas of active sediment transport to more than an order of magnitude in areas where current was too slow to mobilize bed sediment. Seepage was poorly related to hydraulic gradient measured over vertical distances of 0.3 m and appeared to be opposite the hydraulic gradient at 18% of the locations where both parameters were measured. Results demonstrate the scale dependence of these measurements in coarse-grained hyporheic settings and indicate that hydraulic gradients should be determined over a much shorter vertical increment if used to indicate exchange across the sediment-water interface.

27,"Akpalu, W",Feb 2021 ,Connectivity at a cost: Economic dynamics of restoring habitat connectivity,NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING,"Both in the United States and in Europe there is ongoing work on reversing habitat fragmentation and the attendant loss in biodiversity in river systems caused by hydropower and other developments. Fish ladders and other measures are being introduced to restore the connectivity in river systems. In this paper, we set up a theoretical model to investigate what the conditions are for such an investment to be socially profitable. We find that, even in cases where it would have been socially preferable not to build hydropower installations in the first place, connectivity-restoring measures affecting the installations are not necessarily socially beneficial. This is the case for a wide range of plausible assumptions about discount rates, investment costs and productivity losses.Recommendations for Resource Managers:Even in situations where it would have been socially preferable not to build hydropower plants in a river, carrying out measures now to reconnect different parts of the river and re-establish ecological connectivity may not be socially desirable.Any economic analysis of the value of re-establishing ecological connectivity needs to consider the time lags involved until the river ecology is restored.Reducing the time lags by actively resettling species does not necessarily improve the overall social profitability of reconnecting the different parts of the river.Show less"
28,"Mahoney, DT",Oct 20 2020 ,Integrating connectivity theory within watershed modelling part II: Application and evaluating structural and functional connectivity,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Integrating connectivity theory within watershed modelling is one solution to overcome spatial and temporal shortcomings of sediment transport prediction, and Part I and II of these companion papers advance this overall goal. In Part II of these companion papers, we investigate sediment flux via connectivity formula discretized over many catchments and then integrated via sediment routing; and we advance model evaluation technology by using hysteresis of sensor data. Model evaluation with hysteresis indices provides nearly a 100% increase in model statistics. Hysteresis loop evaluation shows a shift from near linear behavior at low to moderate events and then clock-wise loops for larger events indicating the importance of proximal sediment sources. Catchment-scale sediment flux varies as function of the probability of timing and extent of connectivity of an individual catchment. Watershed-scale sediment flux shows self-similarity for the main stem of the river channel as the 181 catchments are integrated moving down gradient. Sediment flux varies from event-to-event as a function of the most sensitive connected pathways, including ephemeral gullies and roadside ditches in this basin. These sensitive pathways contribute disproportionately large amounts to overall sediment yield regardless of the total rainfall depth. Prediction requires the connectivity formula, erosion formula and sediment routing formula; and the probability of connectivity alone was a poor predictor for sediment transport. The result highlights the importance of coupling connectivity simulations with sediment transport formula, and our method provides one such approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

29,"Zhu, J",2015 ,Nonlinear effects of locally heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields on regional stream-aquifer exchanges,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Computational experiments are performed to evaluate the effects of locally heterogeneous conductivity fields on regional exchanges of water between stream and aquifer systems in the Middle Heihe River basin (MHRB) of north-western China. The effects are found to be nonlinear in the sense that simulated discharges from aquifers to streams are systematically lower than discharges produced by a base model parameterized with relatively coarse effective conductivity. A similar, but weaker, effect is observed for stream leakage. The study is organized around three hypotheses: (H1) small-scale spatial variations of conductivity significantly affect regional exchanges of water between streams and aquifers in river basins, (H2) aggregating small-scale heterogeneities into regional effective parameters systematically biases estimates of stream-aquifer exchanges, and (H3) the biases result from slow paths in groundwater flow that emerge due to small-scale heterogeneities. The hypotheses are evaluated by comparing stream-aquifer fluxes produced by the base model to fluxes simulated using realizations of the MHRB characterized by local (grid-scale) heterogeneity. Levels of local heterogeneity are manipulated as control variables by adjusting coefficients of variation. All models are implemented using the MODFLOW (Modular Three-dimensional Finite-difference Groundwater Flow Model) simulation environment, and the PEST (parameter estimation) tool is used to calibrate effective conductivities defined over 16 zones within the MHRB. The effective parameters are also used as expected values to develop lognormally distributed conductivity (K) fields on local grid scales. Stream-aquifer exchanges are simulated with K fields at both scales and then compared. Results show that the effects of small-scale heterogeneities significantly influence exchanges with simulations based on local-scale heterogeneities always producing discharges that are less than those produced by the base model. Although aquifer heterogeneities are uncorrelated at local scales, they appear to induce coherent slow paths in groundwater fluxes that in turn reduce aquifer-stream exchanges. Since surface watergroundwater exchanges are critical hydrologic processes in basin-scale water budgets, these results also have implications for water resources management.Show less"

Extensive research has identified constraints hampering biotic recovery, but successful projects are still scarce. This study documents short-term macroinvertebrate colonisation in a near-natural environment with plentiful potential colonists, which has rarely been studied. Three streams contiguous with near-natural aquatic habitats were monitored over sixteen months after restoration. Sampling sections were categorised and compared to reference sections. Species richness and composition, abundance, functional parameters and similarity to reference were evaluated. Restored streams were colonised rapidly and, in multiple respects, reached reference levels within the study period. Distance from upstream colonisation source and restoration method (newly built and rebuilt channels) had little effect on recovery. However, species composition of upper and lower sections diversified, as they receive colonists from various sources. Repeated sampling revealed dynamic assemblage development with Chironomidae, Baetidae and Nemouridae being among the pioneer colonists. A common successional pattern was observed; gatherers/collectors and small, plurivoltine larvae decreased, whereas predators, grazers/scrapers and medium-sized, univoltine larvae increased. This study demonstrates that restoration of previously channelised streams in near-natural environment is followed by rapid macroinvertebrate colonisation, successfully promoting biodiversity.Show less"
32,"Hladyz, S",Jun 2012 ,Temporal variations in organic carbon utilization by consumers in a lowland river,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Understanding temporal trophic interactions in riverine food webs is essential for predicting river ecosystem function and improving management of these ecosystems. Temporal changes in energy flows through riverine food webs are readily assumed but are rarely tested. Temporal variability in food webs from two reaches of a lowland river (Ovens River, south-eastern Australia) with differing levels of floodplain connectivity were examined over 12 months. We investigated how seasonal changes, flow variability and floodplain connectivity influence (i) stable isotope signatures of basal organic carbon sources (terrestrial sources: trees and grasses; aquatic sources: seston, biofilm and filamentous algae) and consumers (macroinvertebrates and fish) and (ii) the relative proportions of organic carbon sources contributing to consumer biomass using mixing models. We hypothesized (i) that during high flows, increased floodplain connectivity would increase the lateral exchange of terrestrial carbon subsidies to main channel consumers and (ii) that during low flow periods, main channel consumers would derive the majority of their carbon from aquatic benthic sources. Results indicated that isotope signatures for basal sources and for most of the consumers varied temporally and spatially. Mixing models indicated that increased floodplain connectivity did not increase terrestrial subsidies to consumers during high flows. Seston was the primary source during high flows whilst terrestrial vegetation increased in importance during low flows. Filamentous algae was also important during low flows for some consumers. These findings indicate that it is essential to include temporal variability in order to understand energy flows in lowland rivers, thus allowing for the dynamic nature of these ecosystems.

33,"Erickson, LC",Jan 2017 ,Meta-analytic connectivity modeling of the human superior temporal sulcus,BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION,"The superior temporal sulcus (STS) is a critical region for multiple neural processes in the human brain Hein and Knight (J Cogn Neurosci 20(12): 2125-2136, 2008). To better understand the multiple functions of the STS it would be useful to know more about its consistent functional coactivations with other brain regions. We used the meta-analytic connectivity modeling technique to determine consistent functional coactivation patterns across experiments and behaviors associated with bilateral anterior, middle, and posterior anatomical STS subregions. Based on prevailing models for the cortical organization of audition and language, we broadly hypothesized that across various behaviors the posterior STS (pSTS) would coactivate with dorsal-stream regions, whereas the anterior STS (aSTS) would coactivate with ventral-stream regions. The results revealed distinct coactivation patterns for each STS subregion, with some overlap in the frontal and temporal areas, and generally similar coactivation patterns for the left and right STS. Quantitative comparison of STS subregion coactivation maps demonstrated that the pSTS coactivated more strongly than other STS subregions in the same hemisphere with dorsal-stream regions, such as the inferior parietal lobule (only left pSTS), homotopic pSTS, precentral gyrus and supplementary motor area. In contrast, the aSTS showed more coactivation with some ventral-stream regions, such as the homotopic anterior temporal cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus, pars orbitalis (only right aSTS). These findings demonstrate consistent coactivation maps across experiments and behaviors for different anatomical STS subregions, which may help future studies consider various STS functions in the broader context of generalized coactivations for individuals with and without neurological disorders.Show less"
34,"Quick, AM",Apr 2019 ,Nitrous oxide from streams and rivers: A review of primary biogeochemical pathways and environmental variables,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,"Atmospheric concentrations of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) have increased dramatically over the last 100 years, and part of these emissions come from streams and rivers. N2O production has been more carefully studied in soils, but runoff of reactive nitrogen, likely from fertilizer, influences lotic N2O emissions. N2O production and consumption are strongly microbially mediated and mostly involve oxidation and reduction of the reactive nitrogen species ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite. Of the four main pathways leading to N2O production in soils and sediments, incomplete denitrification is likely the globally dominant N2O generating pathway and is favored by elevated nitrate concentrations, suboxic conditions, and sufficient organic carbon to promote reduction. The two pathways that oxidize ammonia, nitrifier denitrification and nitrification, are favored with higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen and ammonia. It is often difficult to distinguish these two pathways in field settings, but most evidence suggests that nitrifier-denitrification is likely the globally more significant of the two. The fourth reaction pathway is dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), in which N2O may be produced from intermediate nitrite. This pathway is more recently discovered, and its global relevance remains uncertain.The key variables influencing N2O cycling, concentrations of the primary reactants (nitrate and ammonia), organic carbon, and dissolved oxygen (DO), may vary temporally with season and time of day. Increasing nitrate and ammonia generally result in higher N2O production. Elevated carbon availability generally promotes denitrification. However, N2O yield is generally higher when carbon is less available or less reactive. Efforts to quantify N2O in lotic settings include mostly studies of N2O dissolved in or emitted from surface water, with fewer studies of N2O produced or emitted from sediments. With some exceptions and limits, N2O emissions are generally positively correlated with nitrate concentration (and in some cases, ammonia concentration). Most studies observe more N2O emissions with low DO. Lotic N2O emissions were generally higher in the warmer months and at night. Most studies assume a denitrification source for N2O, except in the case of high DO and NH4+, in which nitrification is assumed.Lotic N2O production and consumption may take place in the hyporheic zone along groundwater flow paths and in the water column of streams and rivers. Because microbial nitrogen processing requires substrate, influx of reactants, appropriate redox conditions, and intermediate residence times, the hyporheic zone is likely the site of most N2O production. However, high rates of N2O production may also occur associated with suspended sediments in turbid streams and rivers. Models that combine hydromorphogical and chemical variables are most likely to provide the best predictions of N2O emissions. Such models and some observations suggest that N2O emissions decrease downstream as sedimentary processes (likely denitrification) decrease relative to processes in the surface water (likely nitrification). Downstream sites could have large N2O emissions, however, due to inputs of nitrate or ammonia. Better quantification of lotic N2O processing will inform the emission factors incorporated into greenhouse gas budgets. Both quantification and mitigation of N2O emissions will benefit from future research that more closely examines the biogeochemical pathways and physical settings for N2O production and consumption.Show less"
35,"Nutzmann, G",Sep 2009 ,Exchange between ground water and surface water at the lowland River Spree,GRUNDWASSER,"Water exchange processes in the floodplain of a lowland groundwater-surface water system are studied on the basis of a study site near Freienbrink, NE Germany. The boundaries of this site are formed by an oxbow and the current bed of the river Spree, section Muggelspree. Surface and ground water levels were collected in 12 piezometers and at two recording stage gauges of a 300 m long transect throughout a one-year-period. Due to water level fluctuations, alternating periods of infiltration and exfiltration have been observed. However, most of the time groundwater flux is directed into the river Spree and river water infiltration events into the aquifer are usually short and of minor importance. Due to clogging of the oxbow bed, the hydraulic contact between the oxbow and the adjacent aquifer is marginal. These features are modelled quantitatively using MODFLOW in order to simulate ground water flow in the local aquifer.Show less"

Recent advances in river restoration help planning efforts more systematically to reach ecological targets at the least costs. However, such approaches are often desktop-based and overlook real-world constraints. We argue that combining two techniques commonly used in the conservation arena - expert judgement and systematic planning - will deliver cost-effective restoration plans with a high potential for implementation. We tested this idea targeting the restoration of spawning habitat, i.e. gravel bars, for 11 rheophilic fish species along a river system in Germany (Havel-Spree rivers). With a group of local fish experts, we identified the location and extent of potential gravel bars along the rivers and necessary improvements to migration barriers to ensure fish passage. Restoration cost of each gravel bar included the cost of the action itself plus a fraction of the cost necessary to ensure longitudinal connectivity by upgrading or building fish passages located downstream. We set restoration targets according to the EU Water Framework Directive, i.e. relative abundance of 11 fish species in the reference community and optimised a restoration plan by prioritising a subset of restoration sites from the full set of identified sites, using the conservation planning software Marxan. Out of the 66 potential gravel bars, 36 sites which were mainly located in the downstream section of the system were selected, reflecting their cost-effectiveness given that fewer barriers needed intervention. Due to the limited overall number of sites that experts identified as being suitable for restoring spawning habitat, reaching abundance-targets was challenged. We conclude that coupling systematic river restoration planning with expert judgement produces optimised restoration plans that account for on-the-ground implementation constraints. If applied, this approach has a high potential to enhance overall efficiency of future restoration efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
38,"Wegener, P",Jun 2018 ,Evaluating Controls on Nutrient Retention and Export in Wide and Narrow Valley Segments of a Mountain River Corridor,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Over the past few decades, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations have increased within streams of the central Rockies, a pattern linked to regional N deposition trends. As NO3-N concentrations increase, in-stream biological demand may become saturated and stream N export may increase. In mountain landscapes, streams generally flow through steep, narrow valleys with limited riparian area and strong stream-hillslope connectivity. Interspersed between the narrow valleys are wide segments where substantial floodplain riparian areas can develop. Here, we coupled measures of stream reach NO3-N flux balances with nutrient enrichment experiments along two stream reaches of contrasting valley morphology in Rocky Mountain National Park. The stream reaches were (1) a narrow valley segment with limited floodplain riparian area and (2) a longitudinally adjacent (directly downstream) wide valley segment with extensive floodplain riparian area. We found that in-stream biological uptake of added NO3-N was limited in both segments, presumably as a consequence of saturating conditions. Assessment of mass flux indicated that the narrow valley segment was a consistent source of water and NO3-N across flow states, while the wide segment was a sink at high flow and a source at low flow. Due to low in-stream biological retention, gross gains and losses of water and NO3-N to and from the stream exerted primary constraint on segment mass balances. Our results suggest that the exchange of water and nutrients between the stream and adjacent landscape can exert strong control on reach-scale nutrient export, particularly in streams experiencing or approaching N saturation.Show less"

Using data from nearly 50,000 large dams, we assessed stream network fragmentation and flow alteration by large dams for streams of the conterminous USA. We developed 21 dam metrics characterizing a diversity of dam influences operating at both localized (e.g., distances-to-dams) and landscape scales (e.g., cumulative reservoir storage throughout stream networks) for every stream reach in the study region. We further evaluated how dams have affected stream fish assemblages within large ecoregions using more than 37,000 stream fish samples. Stream's have been severely fragmented by large dams, with the number of stream segments increasing by 801% compared to free-flowing streams in the absence of dams and a staggering 79% of stream length is disconnected from their outlet (i.e., oceans and Great Lakes). Flow alteration metrics demonstrate a landscape-scale disturbance of dams, resulting in total upstream reservoir storage volumes exceeding estimated annual discharge volumes of many of the nation's largest rivers. Further, we show large-scale changes in fish assemblages With dams. Species adapted to lentic habitats increase with dams across the conterminous USA, while rheophils, lithophils, and intolerant fishes decrease with dams. Overall, fragmentation and flow alteration by dams have affected fish assemblages as Much or more than other anthropogenic stressors, with dam effects generally increasing with stream size. Dam-induced stream fragmentation and flow alteration are critical natural resource issues. This study emphasizes the importance of considering dams as a landscape-scale disturbance to river habitats along with the need to assess differential effects that dams may have on river habitats and the fishes they support. Together, these insights are essential for more effective conservation of stream resource's and biotic communities globally. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"

It is a typical Alpine river, flowing from Julian Alps. On entering Croatia, it becomes a typical lowland river. The possible influence of sediments of the sub-basins of Savinja, Krka and Kupa rivers on the sediments of the main course of Sava River was studied.Mineralogical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical composition by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Two different procedures to identify anomalous geochemical data, the box plot method and the median absolute deviation (MAD), were used.Results obtained by the box plot method showed that anomalous concentrations (extremes or outliers) of Zn, Ph, In, Cu, Co, Se, Zr, Cd, As, K, Na, Tl, Ba, B, Mn, and Fe are present in sediments of the Celje region, as well as of Cr, Ni, S, In, Cu, Mo, Ph in Moste dam (pollution traced down to Camping Sobec), and of Hg in Litija-Zagorje mining region. The MAD method is more sensitive, and depicts the same polluted areas, but with more anomalous values, which are above threshold values for toxicity.The results of the selected toxic elements, with concentrations limiting the quality of freshwater sediments, are particularly discussed. Both statistical methods (box plot detection method and MAD method) show two anomalous values for Hg in Sava River near Kranj and Zagorje. The concentrations are much higher than those causing significant toxic effects >>2 ppm. Two locations of Sava River in Croatia (Strelecko and Lukavec Posavski) show a very clean environment with respect to trace elements, although Sava River passed big cities of Zagreb and Sisak. The results clearly indicate self-purification mechanisms of Sava River.A similar future sediment study is recommended on middle and lower Sava drainage basin, of interest for Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, to detect possible pollution centers. In the case of significant pollution, remediation measures should be applied to improve sediment quality and management.Show less"

In order to gain a harmonious development among water resources and economic development in Lake Watershed, it is urgent to quantify the lake inflow. However, the calculation of inflow simulations is severely limited by the lack of information regarding river runoff. This paper attempts calculated inflow in an ungauged stream through use of the coupling water balance method and the Xin'anjiang model, applying it to calculate the inflow in the Chaohu Lake Basin, China. Results show that the coupled model has been proved to be robust in determining inflow in an ungauged stream. The error of daily inflow calculated by the water balance method is between 1.4 and -19.5%, which is within the standard error range (+/- 20%). The calibration and verification results of the coupled model suggest that the simulation results are best in the high inflow year (2016), followed by the normal inflow year (2007) and the low inflow year (1978). The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies for high inflow year, normal inflow year, and low inflow year are 0.82, 0.72, and 0.63, respectively, all of which have reached a satisfactory level. Further, the annual lake inflow simulation in the normal inflow year is 19.4 x 10(8) m(3), while the annual average land surface runoff of the study area is 18.9 x 10(8) m(3), and the relative error is -2.6% by the two ways. These results of the coupled model offer a new way to calculate the inflow in lake/reservoir basins.Show less"

We evaluated the ecosystem effects of river widening to improve sediment relations in the Thur River, Switzerland, 12 years after implementation. We tested if restored and non-restored reaches differed in water physico-chemistry, hyporheic function, primary production, and macroinvertebrate density and composition in relation to the flow regime. Our results showed that (i) spatio-temporal variation in sediment respiration and macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness were driven by interactions between restoration and flow; (ii) riverbed conditions including substrate size, organic matter content, and groundwater-surface water exchange changed due to restoration, but (iii) physico-chemistry, hydraulic conditions, and primary production were not altered by restoration. Importantly, our study revealed that abiotic conditions, except channel morphology, changed only marginally, whereas other ecosystem attributes responded markedly to changes in flow-restoration interactions. These results highlight integrating a more holistic ecosystem perspective in the design and monitoring of restoration projects such as river widening in resource management, preferably in relation to flow-sediment regimes and interactions with the biotic components of the ecosystem.Show less"
43,"Mbaka, JG",Jun 2016 ,Effect of Small Impoundments on Leaf Litter Decomposition in Streams,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Leaf litter decomposition is an important process providing energy to freshwater biota. Flow regulation and dams can strongly alter freshwater ecosystems, but little is known about the effect of small impoundments on leaf litter decomposition rates in headwater streams. In this study, we examined the effect of small water storage impoundments (80 to 720m(3)) on leaf litter decomposition by comparing sites located within 10-m upstream and downstream of nine impoundments (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany) and sites located further upstream and downstream. The impoundments did not have a statistically significant effect on most physico-chemical variables. However, the abundance of shredders and leaf litter decomposition rates decreased in study sites located within 10-m upstream of the area flooded by impoundments. Small impoundments can locally reduce leaf litter decomposition rates in headwater streams. The effect of small impoundments on ecosystem functioning is minor and may require less attention by freshwater managers than other stressors, though this may differ for other ecological aspects such as connectivity.

Implications of hydrological connectivity in a large floodplain river,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The habitat heterogeneity generated and sustained by the connectivity of floodplain habitats, the seasonal flood pulse, and the variability of the physical structures typically found in floodplains of large rivers results in a variable space-time mosaic of water sources that results in a high biodiversity of the river-floodplain system. In order to assess the implications of natural connectivity and the heterogeneity on the patterns of macroinvertebrate assemblages at different spatial scales, monthly samplings in six different mesohabitats (lakes with different hydrological connection and secondary channels with permanently and intermittent flow) of the Parana River floodplain were performed from April 2005 to March 2006. The mesohabitats had different granulometry and detritus composition of their bottom sediments. They also had different conductivity, transparency, and depth in relation to the different connectivity degrees. Mesohabitats differed in the abundance of macroinvertebrates of different taxonomic groups and diversity. The environmental variables were correlated to the patterns of macroinvertebrate abundance, with dominance of different species of annelids and mollusks at the patch, mesohabitats, and island scales. An alpha diversity gradient from the isolated lake (65 taxonomic units) to the secondary channels (25 taxonomic units) was obtained. The analyzed mesohabitats showed a high taxa turnover, with high values not only among the mesohabitats located in the different islands, but also among the mesohabitats in relation to different connectivity degrees. The mesohabitats showed negative co-occurrence of macroinvertebrate assemblages. The spatial heterogeneity, sustained by the connectivity degree, played a key role in structuring benthic assemblages at different scales, positively influencing the regional diversity.Show less"

We ran field surveys in 5 streams of varying size, bed slope, and watershed land use in the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern Virginia. Natural surface-connected macropores were nearly ubiquitous. Macropores in this region arise by a variety of mechanisms, including soil piping, tree root decay, erosion around hardened structures, macroinvertebrate burrows, and invertebrate burrows. Macropore openings were slightly wider than tall, with median cross-sectional widths and heights of 3.5 cm and 3.0 cm, respectively. The median and maximum macropore lengths to first bend were 15.0 cm and 120.5 cm into the bank, respectively. True (tortuous) macropore lengths probably are often greater, and methods to map macropores are needed. Median interspacing of macropores across all streams was 0.38 m, but mean interspacing was 1.12 m, indicating that macropores were clustered in space. Macropores were inundated at different times because of differences in their heights on the stream bank, channel geometry, and stream stage. HEC-RAS modeling of channel hydraulics indicated that only 1 to 32% of macropores were inundated by channel water at base flow, whereas up to 97% were inundated during the largest storms. We ran conservative-tracer injection experiments at base flow in a 30-m reach of a small tributary to 1 study stream. We calculated transient-storage parameters for 2 treatments: 1 without macropores and 1 with artificially created macropores. Our results suggest that constructed macropores weakly increased transient storage (channel:storage zone cross-sectional area [A(s)/A] by 15.0% and fraction of median travel time spent in the transient-storage zone [F-med] by 31.0%) and may affect surface-water-groundwater interactions. Many macropore openings were above typical baseflow water levels, so macropores may enhance bank storage, a possibility that bears further research.Show less"

Discharge regime at Fuirosos is strongly related to the precipitation regime and showed, during the entire study period, a significant decrease, at a rate of -0.4 L/s/y which represents 1.3 % of the estimated average discharge. Further, drought duration is lengthening at a rate of 1.9 d/y, mainly as a consequence of delay of the rewetting phase. Overall, if these trends continue at their current rates, Fuirosos will be converted into an ephemeral stream during the second half of this century. Fuirosos is at the center of an intense research activity focused on the ecology of this aquatic ecosystem. Research topics range from measuring microbial processes in sand sediments to analyzing solute responses under extreme flow conditions (flood and droughts), including metabolism measurements, nutrient retention balances, macro-benthos diversity and leaf inputs in stream reaches or water/solute exchange at the stream-hyporheic interface. Most of these studies revealed that its ecology is related unequivocally to the hydrological regime.

Water residence times and vertical fluxes are derived from temperature and radon data and then directly compared for downwelling profiles. Temperature and radon-derived fluxes in downwelling zones ranged from 0.02 to 24 m day(-1) with a mean of 1.69 m day(-1) while residence times across the study site ranged from tens of minutes to greater than 15 days. The radon approach has the lowest uncertainty for residence times between 0.1 and 15 days while the uncertainty of the temperature approach (using a diel river signal) is lowest for residence times that are less than a few days. For 83% of depths in downwelling profiles, radon-derived residence times were greater (some up to two orders of magnitude greater) than temperature-derived residence times. When the error bounds of the residence time estimates were accounted for, 57% of radon-derived residence times were considerably greater than temperature-derived residence times in downwelling profiles. We suggest that this disparity is due to the different influence of small scale heterogeneity on temperature and radon transport. These field based results indicate that small scale heterogeneity may play a far more important role than has been previously considered in groundwater-surface water interaction studies.
