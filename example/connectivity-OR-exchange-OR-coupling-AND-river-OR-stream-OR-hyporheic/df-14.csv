Despite the importance of hyporheic exchange on riverine ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles, research is limited on the effects of hyporheic fluxes on the fate of reactive solutes within the hyporheic zone. Consequently, we investigate the controls of hyporheic flowpaths, which we link to stream morphology and streamflow, on prevailing hyporheic redox conditions and on biogeochemical transformations occurring within streambeds. We focus on the dissolved inorganic reactive forms of nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate, because nitrogen is one of the most common reactive solutes and an essential nutrient found in stream waters. Our objectives are to explore the influence of stream morphology, hyporheic water temperature and relative abundance of ammonium and nitrate, on transformation of ammonium, removal of nitrates and production of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. We address our objectives with analytical solutions of the Multispecies Reactive Advection-Dispersion Equation coupled with linearized Monod's kinetics and analytical solutions of the hyporheic flow for alternate-bar morphology. We introduce a new Damkohler number, Da, defined as the ratio between the median hyporheic residence time and the time scale of oxygen consumption, which we prove to be a good indicator of where aerobic or anaerobic conditions prevail. In addition, Da is a key index to quantify hyporheic nitrification and denitrification efficiencies and defines a new theoretical framework for scaling results at both the morphological-unit and stream-reach scales.Show less"
1,"Hannah, DM",Nov 2004 ,"Heat exchanges and temperatures within a salmon spawning stream in the cairngorms, Scotland: Seasonal and sub-seasonal dynamics",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Stream temperatures are often used to predict salmonid embryo development; but there are very few medium-term studies of the heat exchanges determining water column and bed temperatures. Furthermore, no research exists on the energy balance for sub-arctic Scottish rivers. This paper reports results of a hydrometeorological study of a Cairngorm stream (Girnock burn, northeast Scotland) over the salmon spawning-hatch season (late October 2001 to mid-April 2002) that aims: (1) to characterize seasonal and sub-seasonal stream energy budget and thermal dynamics; and (2) to explain these variations with respect to meteorological and hydrological factors. In terms of average energy flux contributions, sensible heat (38.7%), the bed heat flux (37.0%) and friction at the stream bed and banks (24.3%) are heat sources, while latent heat (73.1 %) and net radiation (26.9%) are heat sinks. All energy losses and 38.7% of heat gains occur at the air-water interface; and 61.3% of energy gains (including friction) take place at the water-channel bed interface. Typically, temperatures increase (+ 1.97degreesC) and show dampening of thermal response from the water column to depth in the stream bed. The most salient findings include: (1) the stream bed (atmosphere) is the dominant energy source (sink) for heating (cooling) channel water, which may be attributed to inferred heat advection by groundwater up-welling into the bed of this upland stream; (2) sensible heat is the primary atmospheric energy source due to limited net radiation; (3) friction at the stream bed and banks is an important heat source. Energy budget terms and temperatures exhibit (sub-)seasonal changes in response to meteorological and hydrological conditions; a schematic diagram is presented to summarize these results. This paper clearly illustrates the need for further medium- to long-term empirical stream energy balance research to characterize heat flux dynamics and, thus, understand and predict water temperature variations over time-scales of relevance to biological studies.

2,"HENDRICKS, SP",Oct 1995 ,"SEASONAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL PATTERNS IN SURFACE-WATER, SUBSURFACE HYPORHEIC, AND RIPARIAN GROUND-WATER IN A TEMPERATE STREAM ECOSYSTEM",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Relationships among stream surface water (9-km reach), substream hyporheic water (10-m pool-riffle-pool reach), and riparian groundwater (single site) biogeochemical patterns were examined in four seasons (1989-1990) in a temperate stream ecosystem (Michigan, USA). Surface water concentrations of chloride, dissolved organic carbon (DOG), and chlorophyll-a exceeded those of groundwater during most sampling periods. Groundwater and hyporheic concentrations of silica (SiO2), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate+nitrite (NO3-N), and ammonium (NH4-N) were generally higher than in surface water, particularly during summer. Hyporheic temperatures exhibited sharpest gradients with depth and distance downstream beneath a study riffle during summer and winter. Biologically reactive solutes (SRP, NO3-N, NH4-N, and DOC) generally decreased with depth and increased with distance beneath the riffle during summer and winter as well. Hyporheic patterns were indistinct or more variable during spring and fall and were attributed, in part, to the breakdown of thermal gradients within the bed, similar to seasonal lake turnover (mixis). Similarities between longitudinal/depth gradients in hyporheic patterns and longitudinal stream channel patterns for SiO2 and Cl (the more conservative solutes) indicated potential cumulative groundwater discharge effects through successive hyporheic zones over stream distance. Relationships between hyporheic patterns, stream channel patterns, and the biologically reactive solutes (SRP, NO3-N, NH4-N, DOC) were less clear because of potential biotic or abiotic uptake at the sediment-water interface. Groundwater-surface water interaction within a hyporheic zone forms a complex system structured not only by hydrologic forces but also by seasonal changes in temperature and discharge.Show less"
3,"Rodeles, AA",Jul 3 2019 ,Consideration of habitat quality in a river connectivity index for anadromous fishes,INLAND WATERS,"River fragmentation is one of the main threats to diadromous fish species. We aimed to create a new and simple connectivity index to calculate habitat accessibility that considers habitat suitability for fish species, using the Bidasoa River basin in the north of Spain and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) as an example. A habitat connectivity index (HCI) was calculated for the river basin using upstream passability and segment length as variables. We then calculated a new habitat quality index for each river segment and multiplied it by river segment length to create the Breeding Habitat Connectivity Index (HCIb). These 2 indices were first calculated using only upstream barrier passability and then by adding downstream passability. In each case, the indices show different outcomes but a similar pattern: in all cases, main-stem obstacles closest to the river mouth most affected the connectivity index, even when habitat quality was considered. Although we cannot compare the indices to the real area used by salmon because spatial tracking was not performed during the study years, we consider that including habitat quality in a river connectivity index adds useful information for scientists and managers.Show less"
4,"Gu, YC",Aug 12 2022 ,Continuous assessment of the adaptability between river network connectivity and water security in a typical highly urbanized area in eastern China,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"Urbanization has reduced river network connectivity, posing a great threat to water security. However, the mechanism through which changes in river network connectivity impact water security remains uncertain. River network connectivity and water security have been separately and thoroughly assessed by several researchers; however, few studies conducted a coupled assessment of these two aspects together, which may shed light on this mechanism. Based on assessment indicators developed in previous studies and key influence factors identified in the study area, this study proposed a comprehensive evaluation method to continually evaluate the adaptability between river network connectivity and water security in the Wuchengxiyu region, a highly urbanized area in Eastern China. The continuous evaluation was conducted for the period 2010-2019 based on the coupling coordination degree calculation formula. The results show that from 2010 to 2015, the coupling coordination degree between river network connectivity and water security followed a downward trend, due to the uncoordinated development between water systems and urbanization. After 2015, an increasing trend was observed with the implementation of environmental policies. In the past decade, the water surface rate and the coverage rate of suitable flow velocity decreased from 4.59% to 4.28% and from 54.1% to 30.9%, respectively, which may have negative effects on water quality and limit the improvement of regional flood control capacity. Moreover, the evaluation results also prove that policies such as the Ecological River-Lake Construction and the River Chief System have contributed to improve the quality of the water environment and regional flood control. The proposed assessment framework can be used as a guidance to evaluate the relationship between water network connectivity and water security; moreover, it provides new ideas for water network system protection and water quality maintenance in similar highly urbanized areas.Show less"
5,"Fergus, CE",Aug 2017 ,"The freshwater landscape: lake, wetland, and stream abundance and connectivity at macroscales",ECOSPHERE,"Inland water bodies and their surface hydrologic connections are active components in the landscape, influencing multiple ecological processes that can propagate to broad-scale phenomena such as regional nutrient and carbon cycles and metapopulation dynamics. However, while lake, wetland, and stream abundance has been estimated at regional and global extents, less attention has been paid to freshwater connectivity attributes among aquatic systems at macroscales. Thus, regional to continental patterns of freshwater abundance and connectivity are poorly understood. We measured lake, wetland, and stream abundance and surface connectivity attributes (i.e., landscape position within stream networks) at a subcontinental extent in the Midwest and Northeast United States to characterize macroscale spatial patterns of the freshwater landscape (i.e., abundance and connectivity attributes of lakes, wetlands, and streams). We found that lake and wetland abundance exhibited opposite spatial patterns from stream density that generally followed glaciation extent boundaries-lake and wetland abundance was high north of the glaciation boundary, whereas stream density was high south of the glaciation boundary. Freshwater connectivity attributes exhibited distinct spatial patterns as defined by our integrated freshwater clusters and revealed a layer of complexity not captured by abundance measures. Patterns of freshwater abundance and connectivity in the study extent were associated primarily with glaciation and secondarily with hydrogeomorphic (e.g., surficial geology and topography), climate (e.g., runoff), and land-use (e.g., agriculture) variables, providing insight into potential drivers of freshwater composition and distribution. The connectivity spatial patterns observed suggest that relying solely on freshwater abundance measures in macroscale analyses omits unique information on the structural attributes of freshwater systems that can be critical to key ecological processes. Adopting an integrated freshwater landscape framework to study and manage freshwaters is essential as freshwater systems face broad-scale disturbances that may alter hydrologic connections and subsequently may impact ecosystem processes and services.Show less"
6,"Hiatt, M",Apr 2015 ,Hydrological connectivity in river deltas: The first-order importance of channel-island exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Deltaic systems are composed of distributary channels and interdistributary islands. While previous work has focused either on the channels or on the islands, here we study the hydrological exchange between channels and islands and point at its important role in delta morphology and ecology. We focus our analysis on Wax Lake Delta in coastal Louisiana (USA) and characterize the surface water component of hydrological connectivity through measurements of water discharge and hydraulic tracer propagation. We find that deltaic islands are zones of significant water flux as 23-54% of the incoming distributary channel flux enters the islands. A calculation of the travel times through a channel-island complex shows travel times through the islands to be at least 3 times their channel counterparts. A dye release experiment also indicates that travel times in islands are much longer that those within channels as dye remained in the island for the 3.8 day duration of the experiment. Additionally, islands are more sensitive than channels to environmental forces such as tides, which cause flow reversal and thus can increase travel times through the islands. Our work defines the hydrological network of a river delta to include not only the distributary channel network but also the interdistributary islands, quantifies the implications of channel-island hydrological connectivity to travel times through the system, and discusses the relevance of our findings to channel mouth dynamics at the delta front and the potential for denitrification in coastal systems.Show less"
7,"Brookfield, AE",Oct 1 2013 ,Implications of Hyporheic Flow on Temperature-Based Estimates of Groundwater/Surface Water Interactions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The hyporheic zone has received significant attention in recent years due to its role in regulating the physical, chemical, and biological processes that buffer fluvial systems at a variety of scales. The exchange of water through the hyporheic zone is also important for the regulation of stream and streambed temperatures. Recent research has utilized stream and streambed temperatures to quantify groundwater discharge to streams using a variety of methods, including one-dimensional analytical solutions for vertical flux across the streambed interface. The presence of lateral flows, including hyporheic flow, will cause uncertainty in these analytical solution results. In this study, HydroGeoSphere, a three-dimensional, fully integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic model, is used to simulate the manner in which streambed heterogeneity influences groundwater/surface water interactions along a stream section, and the uncertainty of groundwater/surface water flux estimates based upon streambed temperatures. Groundwater/surface water exchange fluxes from numerical experiments of an idealized linear reach with homogeneous and heterogeneous streambed materials are compared to the results of a one-dimensional analytical solution of groundwater discharge to a stream using the numerically simulated temperature results. Both low- and high-variance distributions of hydraulic conductivity (ln K variances of 0.85 and 17.0, respectively) along the streambed caused hyporheic flow, which caused significant discrepancies between the numerical and analytical groundwater/surface water flux results. A low variance in hydraulic conductivity did result in smaller discrepancies between the numerical and analytical solutions compared to the higher-variance simulations; however, the discrepancies between the low-K-variance simulations and the associated analytical solution interpretation still differed by up to an order in magnitude. The quantity of hyporheic flow increased with increased depth of heterogeneous streambed sediments, causing greater discrepancies between the analytical estimate and the numerical solution of groundwater/surface water exchange. In all simulations the analytical solution underestimated the exchange flux, and in the presence of hyporheic flow, the analytical solution was unable to capture the patterns of exchange flux at the streambed. The three-dimensional modeling approach produced an increase in the lateral flow components within the streambed compared to results inferred from one- and two-dimensional models employed in previous research. This three-dimensional approach enabled analysis of the spatial variability of error between the analytical and numerical results and determined that in environments with lateral flows, including hyporheic flow, the analytical solution is indicative of the patterns of the vertical component of fluid flow to the streambed.Show less"
8,"Zarnetske, JP",Mar 2015 ,Coupling multiscale observations to evaluate hyporheic nitrate removal at the reach scale,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Excess NO3- in streams is a growing and persistent problem for both inland and coastal ecosystems, and denitrification is the primary removal process for NO3-. Hyporheic zones can have high denitrification potentials, but their role in reach- and network-scale NO3- removal is unknown because it is difficult to estimate. We used independent and complementary multiscale measurements of denitrification and total NO3- uptake to quantify the role of hyporheic NO3- removal in a 303-m reach of a 3(rd)-order agricultural stream in western Oregon, USA. We characterized the reach-scale NO3- dynamics with steady-state N-15-NO3- tracer-addition experiments and solute-transport modeling, and measured the hyporheic conditions via in-situ biogeochemical and groundwater modeling. We also developed a method to link these independent multiscale measurements. Hyporheic NO3- removal (rate coefficient (HZ) = 0.007/h) accounted for 17% of the observed total reach NO3- uptake and 32% of the reach denitrification estimated from the N-15 experiments. The primary limitations on hyporheic denitrification at the reach scale were availability of labile dissolved organic C and the restricted size of the hyporheic zone caused by anthropogenic channelization (sediment thickness 1.5 m). Linking multiscale methods made estimates possible for hyporheic influence on stream NO3- dynamics. However, it also demonstrated that the traditional reach-scale tracer experimental designs and subsequent transport modeling cannot be used alone to directly investigate the role of the hyporheic zone on reach-scale water and solute dynamics.Show less"

In the present study, water temperatures (stream and hyporheic) and seepage fluxes were used to characterize shallow ground water discharge and recharge within the streambed of Catamaran Brook, a small Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stream in central New Brunswick, Canada. Three study sites were instrumented using a total of 10 temperature sensors and 18 seepage meters. Highly variable mean seepage fluxes, ranging from 1.7 X 10(-4) to 2.5 cm(3) m(-2) sec(-1), and mean hyporheic water temperatures, ranging from 10.5degrees to 18.0degreesC, at depths of 20 to 30 cm in the streambed were dependent on streambed location (left versus right stream bank and site location) and time during the summer sampling season. Temperature data were useful for determining if an area of the streambed was under discharge (positive flux), recharge (negative flux), or parallel flow (no flux) conditions and seepage meters were used to directly measure the quantity of water flux. Hyporheic water temperature measurements and specific conductance measurements of the seepage meter sample water, mean values ranging from 68.8 to 157.9 muS/cm, provided additional data for determining flux sources. Three stream banks were consistently under discharge conditions, while the other three stream banks showed reversal from discharge to recharge conditions over the sampling season. Results indicate that the majority of the water collected in the seepage meters was composed of surface water. The data obtained suggests that even though a positive seepage flux is often interpreted as ground water discharge, this discharging water may be of stream water origin that has recently entered the hyporheic zone. The measurement of seepage flux in conjunction with hyporheic water temperature or other indicators of water origin should be considered when attempting to quantify the magnitude of exchange and the source of hyporheic water.Show less"

The model provides a coupled solution to the dynamic interactions between a river and a surfacial aquifer and is used to numerically study the effect of stream bed conductivity on the overall system response. To achieve this objective, the model is formulated to include a one-dimensional river flow model and a two-dimensional vertically averaged groundwater flow model in an unconfined aquifer. The coupling is achieved at the river bed via a hydraulic flux that is described as a function of river bed conductivity and the gradient between river stage and groundwater head. The model incorporates the concept of simultaneous presence of the two hydrologic processes for simulating the dynamic interactions and uses a novel numerical technique to solve the two systems concurrently. These interactions are analyzed by numerical experimentation under different hydraulic conductivity conditions. The influence of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient is studied under steady and unsteady flow regimes to assess the occurrence of baseflow. The analysis also reveals critical insights into the governing mechanisms that provide and sustain the baseflow in rivers.Show less"
13,"Krause, S",Jul 2011 ,Inter-disciplinary perspectives on processes in the hyporheic zone,ECOHYDROLOGY,"The interface between groundwater and surface water within riverine/riparian ecosystems-the hyporheic zone (HZ)-is experiencing a rapid growth of research interest from a range of scientific disciplines, often with different perspectives. The majority of the multi-disciplinary research aims to elucidate HZ process dynamics and their importance for surface water and groundwater ecohydrology and biogeochemical cycling. This paper presents a critical inter-disciplinary review of recent advances of research centred on the HZ and highlights the current state of knowledge regarding hydrological, biogeochemical and ecohydrological process understanding. The spatial and temporal variability of surface water and groundwater exchange (hyporheic exchange flows), biogeochemical cycling and heat exchange (thermal regime) are considered in relation to both experimental measurements and modelling of these phenomena. We explore how this knowledge has helped to increase our understanding of HZ ecohydrology, and particularly its invertebrate community, the processing of organic matter, trophic cascading and ecosystem engineering by macrophytes and other organisms across a range of spatial and temporal scales. In addition to providing a detailed review of HZ functions, we present an inter-disciplinary perspective on how to advance and integrate HZ process understanding across traditional discipline boundaries. We therefore attempt to highlight knowledge gaps and research needs within the individual disciplines and demonstrate how innovations and advances in research, made within traditional subject-specific boundaries (e.g. hydrology, biochemistry and ecology), can be used to enhance inter-disciplinary scientific progress by cross-system comparisons and fostering of greater dialogue between scientific disciplines.

14,"Segurado, P",Aug 2013 ,Prioritizing restoration of structural connectivity in rivers: a graph based approach,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,"Longitudinal connectivity is considered a key issue in river management, as it shapes ecological processes from single organisms to populations and ecosystems. Recently, it was shown that network analysis based on spatial graphs has promising applications as a tool for the assessment of connectivity in riverine systems. In this study we used a graph theory approach to identify which barriers most impacted the structural connectivity of a river basin and which connections should preferably be restored or enhanced in order to effectively improve the overall connectivity. An innovative aspect of the proposed methodology is the consideration of the cumulative non-additive impacts produced by barriers, which are especially relevant to organisms of high mobility such as fish. The portuguese river Tagus basin was used as a case study. The cumulative effect of barriers was studied using two approaches: (1) an historical approach in which the impact of barriers was assessed sequentially following the historical succession of construction; (2) a ""backward"" approach in which barriers were sequentially removed according to their impact. The overall structural connectivity of the river basin decreased to about 50 % of its original value after the major dams were constructed. Results show that it would be necessary to rehabilitate 11 connections in order to increase the overall structural connectivity to 90 % of its original value. This work proposes a novel and straightforward approach to prioritize rehabilitation actions in river systems, providing a promising tool for decision-makers.Show less"
15,"van Puijenbroek, PJTM",Sep 2021 ,"Through the dam into troubled waters: Combined effects of stream fragmentation, habitat deterioration, and poor water quality on lowland stream fish distribution",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"This study aimed to distinguish the contribution of stream fragmentation and poor habitat and water quality to the decline in riverine fish species. The species presence was related to the number of barriers between a specific lowland stream section and the main river and to the length of the stream section remaining between two barriers. To investigate the relationship between the absence of fish species and poor ecological water quality, the EQR and stream velocity indices were compared between accessible sites where the fish was either present or absent. 79% of the 1039 km lowland stream length was disconnected from the river Meuse by one or more barriers and 34% by more than 5 barriers, while 28% of all stream sections were shorter than 2.5 km. Only 2% of sites scored a very good water quality, while all study sites were characterized by (very) slow flowing waters (<0.15 m/s). As many fish passages are built to improve connectivity, fish passages do not improve habitat quality. Gudgeon and stone loach were hardly affected by stream fragmentation, and only slightly by too short stream sections. Ide was moderately affected, while the migratory species chub and dace were severely affected by stream fragmentation. Chub and dace were also sensitive to poor habitat and water quality. Distinguishing the effects of stream fragmentation, habitat deterioration, and poor water quality on lowland stream fish distribution increased the understanding of the reasons for the presence and absence of species and may aid effective management and restoration efforts.Show less"
16,"Marmonier, P",Nov 1 2019 ,Does spatial heterogeneity of hyporheic fauna vary similarly with natural and artificial changes in braided river width?,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Heterogeneity of hyporheic fauna is associated with geomorphological features and related vertical water exchanges. Constrictions on river floodplain are known to induce groundwater inputs and increase stygobite fauna. Two floodplain constrictions were studied in a large braided river (the Drome River): one linked to a natural process (valley narrowing), another to an artificial river regulation (early 20th embankment). Spatial distribution of hyporheic organisms were sampled upstream and downstream of the two constrained sections, at 9 stations, 3 positions (left and right sides, centre of the braided strip), 3 replication points and at a depth of 50 cm in the river sediment. The spatial heterogeneity in community composition was higher near the banks than at the centre of the braided strip, no matter the width of the strip. The artificial constriction induced a decrease in spatial heterogeneity of the benthic fraction of the hyporheic fauna, but no changes were detected for the stygofauna. The natural valley narrowing reduced width and thickness of the alluvium and induced an inflow of groundwater resulting in an increase in stygofauna abundance. Natural floodplain narrowing linked to geology thus control the distribution of stygobite species, while artificial constrictions only modify the spatial distribution of the benthic fraction of the hyporheic fauna.

17,"Benjankar, R",May 2016 ,Effects of habitat quality and ambient hyporheic flows on salmon spawning site selection,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Understanding the role of stream hydrologic and morphologic variables on the selection of spawning sites by salmonid fishes at high resolution across broad scales is needed for effective habitat restoration and protection. Here we used remotely sensed meter-scale channel bathymetry for a 13.5km reach of Chinook salmon spawning stream in central Idaho to describe habitat quality and set boundary conditions for a two-dimensional surface water model coupled with a three-dimensional hyporheic flux model. Metrics describing ambient hyporheic flow intensity and habitat quality, which is quantified as a function of stream hydraulics and morphology, were compared to the locations of nests built by female salmon. Nest locations were predicted most accurately by habitat quality followed by channel morphology (i.e., riffles location). As a lesser degree than habitat quality, water surface curvature was also a good indicator of spawning location because its intensity can identify riffle morphology. The ambient hyporheic flow predicted at meter-scale resolution was not a strong predictor of redd site selection. Furthermore, the study suggests direct morphological measurements obtained from easily measured channel bathymetry data could enable effective and rapid assessments of salmon spawning channels across broad areas.Show less"
18,"Deng, ZQ",Sep 2010 ,Effect of channel size on solute residence time distributions in rivers,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The effect of channel size on residence time distributions (RTDs) of solute in rivers is investigated in this paper using tracer test data and the variable residence time (VART) model. Specifically, the investigation focuses on the influence of shear dispersion and hyporheic exchange on the shape of solute RID, and how these two transport processes prevail in larger and smaller streams, respectively, leading to distinct tails of RID. Simulation results show that (1) RTDs are dispersion-dependent and thereby channel-size (scale) dependent. RTDs increasing longitudinal dispersion coefficient. Small streams with negligible dispersion coefficient may display various types of RID from upward curving patterns to a straight line (power-law distributions) and further to downward curving lognormal distributions when plotted in log-log coordinates. Moderate-sized rivers are transitional in terms of RTDs and commonly exhibit lognormal and power-law RTDs; (2) the incorporation of water and solute losses/gains in the VART model can improve simulation results and make parameter values more reasonable; (3) the ratio of time to peak concentration to the minimum mean residence time is equal to the recovery ratio of tracer. The relation provides a simple method for determining the minimum mean residence time; and (4) the VART model is able to reproduce various RTDs observed in rivers with 3-4 fitting parameters while no user-specified RID functions are needed.

A rapid stream assessment technique and a multimetric index were used to describe the physical conditions of multiple reaches in four watersheds. Watersheds were characterized using geographic information system (GIS) derived landscape metrics that represent the magnitude of urbanization at three spatial scales and the connectivity of urban land. Physical conditions, as measured by the physical stream conditions index (PSCI), were best explained for the watersheds by two landscape metrics: quantity of intense and grassy urban land in the subwatershed and quantity of intense and grassy urban land within 500 m of the site (R-2 = 0.52, p < 0.0005). A multiple regression of PSCI with these metrics and an additional connectivity metric (proximity of a road crossing) provided the best model for the three urban watersheds (R-2 = 0.41, p < 0.0005). Analyses of longitudinal trends in PSCI within the three urban watersheds showed that conditions improved when a stream flowed through an intact riparian buffer with forest or wetland vegetation and without road crossings. Results demonstrate that information on spatial scale and patterns of urbanization is essential to understanding and successfully managing urban streams.Show less"
20,"Craft, JA",Feb 2002 ,Microbial respiration within a floodplain aquifer of a large gravel-bed river,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Aerobic respiration, productivity and the carbon turnover rate of microbial biofilms were determined at hyporheic and phreatic sites in the Kalispell Valley alluvial aquifer along a transect extending 3.9 km laterally from the main channel of the Flathead River, a sixth order river in Montana (U.S.A.). The effect of experimentally increasing bioavailable organic carbon (acetate) on the respiration rate of biofilms in this carbon-poor [dissolved organic carbon (DOC) < 2 mg L-1] aquifer was also measured.2. Chambers containing natural substratum were placed in-situ and allowed to colonise for 20 weeks. After 4, 12 and 20 weeks, they were taken to the laboratory where oxygen flux was measured in a computer-controlled, flow-through respirometry system.3. Respiration ranged from 0.01 to 0.33 mg O-2 dm(-3) h(-1) across sites, with means ranging from 0.10 to 0.17 mg O-2 dm(-3) h(-1). Productivity estimates ranged from 0.18 to 0.32 mg C dm(-3) day(-1) (mean 0.25, SE 0.03). The total organic carbon (TOC) of the microbial biofilms ranged from 18.2 to 29.7 mg C dm(-3). Turnover rate ranged from 3.2 to 5.6 year(-1) with a mean of 4.2 year(-1).4. At the hyporheic site very close to the river, respiration did not significantly increase when samples were supplemented with labile carbon. Respiration increased with increasing DOC addition at hyporheic sites more distant from the river, suggesting a carbon-limitation gradient within the hyporheic zone. Microbes at the phreatic site did not respond to increasing DOC addition, suggesting that the phreatic biofilm is adapted to low carbon availability.5. Comparing the volume of the alluvial aquifer (about 0.7 km(3)) to that of the river benthic sediments (to 0.25 m depth, which amounts to about 1.6 x 10(-4) km(3)) within the Flathead Valley, leads to the conclusion that interstitial microbial productivity is orders of magnitude greater than benthic productivity. Alluvial aquifers are often voluminous and microbial production is an enormous component of ecosystem production in rivers such as the Flathead.Show less"
21,"Chen, MH",Dec 2022 ,Exploring the Influences of Stream Network Structure and Connectivity on Water Environment Risk in China,WATER,"Stream networks are the transportation channels of pollutants that can significantly influence water environment risk (WER). However, the influences of stream network structure and connectivity (SC) on WER at the national scale and its regional variability have been rarely investigated in China. In this study, the WER was assessed from the grey water footprint of nitrogen and phosphorus in 214 catchments in China. The relationship between WER and SC and its regional variability were analyzed using correlation and grey relational analysis. Results showed that the water environment risk index (RI) in some catchments located in the Hai and Liao River Basins was the highest in China (RI > 0.8). On national scale, longitudinal connectivity (C-l) and cyclical connectivity (C-c) had the strongest influences on WER with grey relational degree index (GRAI) of 0.68 and 0.67, respectively. The average slope (S-r) was the most important in humid zones, whereas C-l and water surface ratio (R-w) had a stronger influence in arid zones. In zones with intensive human activities, C-c, river density (R-d), and the node connection ratio (R-nc) mostly affected WER. The main influenced factors varied significantly among nationwide and different zones, which indicated that climate and human activities played an important role in the spatial variation of the relationship between WER and SC.

We present a depth-integrated approach in which flows in the vadose and saturated zones are assumed to be parallel to the bottom of the aquifer and thus are integrated in the direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer. The hydrodynamic parameters are also integrated in this direction, and gravity effects are preserved. Stream flow is handled by a diffusive-wave equation that is calculated over a network of one-dimensional bonds. The first-order coupling between the stream and subsurface flows exchanges water fluxes between the stream network and the subsurface compartment according to the hydraulic head differences between the systems. Three synthetic test cases, one including a comparison with a three-dimensional code, are used to evaluate the general behavior of the coupled model. It is shown that the approach reproduces the main hydrological features at the catchment scale, including the generation of runoff, infiltration exfiltration into (from) the vadose zone, and smooth transient head variations in the aquifer.

23,"Munz, M",Nov 2017 ,Coupled Long-Term Simulation of Reach-Scale Water and Heat Fluxes Across the River-Groundwater Interface for Retrieving Hyporheic Residence Times and Temperature Dynamics,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Flow patterns in conjunction with seasonal and diurnal temperature variations control ecological and biogeochemical conditions in hyporheic sediments. In particular, hyporheic temperatures have a great impact on many temperature-sensitive microbial processes. In this study, we used 3-D coupled water flow and heat transport simulations applying the HydroGeoSphere code in combination with high-resolution observations of hydraulic heads and temperatures to quantify reach-scale water and heat flux across the river-groundwater interface and hyporheic temperature dynamics of a lowland gravel bed river. The model was calibrated in order to constrain estimates of the most sensitive model parameters. The magnitude and variations of the simulated temperatures matched the observed ones, with an average mean absolute error of 0.7 degrees C and an average Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.87. Our results indicate that nonsubmerged streambed structures such as gravel bars cause substantial thermal heterogeneity within the saturated sediment at the reach scale. Individual hyporheic flow path temperatures strongly depend on the flow path residence time, flow path depth, river, and groundwater temperature. Variations in individual hyporheic flow path temperatures were up to 7.9 degrees C, significantly higher than the daily average (2.8 degrees C), but still lower than the average seasonal hyporheic temperature difference (19.2 degrees C). The distribution between flow path temperatures and residence times follows a power law relationship with exponent of about 0.37. Based on this empirical relation, we further estimated the influence of hyporheic flow path residence time and temperature on oxygen consumption which was found to partly increase by up to 29% in simulations.Show less"
24,"Yang, C",Sep 2018 ,Model-Based Analysis of the Effects of Dam-Induced River Water and Groundwater Interactions on Hydro-Biogeochemical Transformation of Redox Sensitive Contaminants in a Hyporheic Zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone (HZ) may retard the contaminants migration from groundwater to the river and vice versa. Anthropogenic activities may further complicate such processes. This study investigated the effects of dam-induced hydrodynamics on biogeochemical transformation of contaminants using Cr as an example in the HZ of the Columbia River at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site. The flow velocities in the HZ were first simulated using the measured or averaged groundwater level and river stage at hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly time scales. The flow velocities were then incorporated into a reactive transport model with independently characterized biogeochemical reactions and kinetics. Simulation results indicated that hydrodynamics can significantly influence the rate and extent of Cr (VI) biogeochemical transformation, which was mainly controlled by the kinetic reduction of Cr (VI) to sparely soluble Cr (III) by sediment-associated Fe (II) that can be regenerated by microorganisms with organic carbon as electron donor. The frequent flow direction reversals in the HZ induced by dam operations enhanced the rate of microbial consumption of bioavailable OC, which, if there was no organic carbon supply, can eventually terminate the Fe (II) regeneration mechanism and exhaust the HZ's redox capacity in reducing Cr (VI) to Cr (III). This study demonstrated the importance of hydrodynamics on biogeochemical transformation of contaminants in the HZ and of the time scales used in assessing the reactive transport of chemicals and contaminants in the HZ as the net supply of redox sensitive chemicals such as dissolved oxygen into the HZ is a function of the frequency of flow direction reversal.Show less"
25,"Jansson, R",Apr 2007 ,Restoring freshwater ecosystems in riverine landscapes: the roles of connectivity and recovery processes,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. This paper introduces key messages from a number of papers emanating from the Second International Symposium on Riverine Landscapes held in August 2004 in Sweden, focusing on river restoration. Together these papers provide an overview of the science of river restoration, and point out future research needs.2. Restoration tests the feasibility of recreating complex ecosystems from more simple and degraded states, thereby presenting a major challenge to ecological science. Therefore, close cooperation between practitioners and scientists would be beneficial, but most river restoration projects are currently performed with little or no scientific involvement.3. Key messages emanating from this series of papers are: The scope, i.e. the maximum and minimum spatial extent and temporal duration of habitat use, of species targeted for restoration should be acknowledged, so that all relevant stages in their life cycles are considered. Species that have been lost from a stream cannot be assumed to recolonise spontaneously, calling for strategies to ensure the return of target species to-be integrated into projects. Possible effects of invasive exotic species also need to be incorporated into project plans, either to minimise the impact of exotics, or to modify the expected outcome of restoration in cases where extirpation of exotics is impractical.4. Restoration of important ecological processes often implies improving connectivity of the stream. For example, longitudinal and lateral connectivity can be enhanced by restoring fluvial dynamics on flood-suppressed rivers and by increasing water availability in rivers subject to water diversion or withdrawal, thereby increasing habitat and species diversity. Restoring links between surface and ground water flow enhances vertical connectivity and communities associated with the hyporheic zone.5. Future restoration schemes should consider where in the catchment to locate projects to make restoration most effective, consider the cumulative effects of many small projects, and evaluate the potential to restore ecosystem processes under highly constrained conditions such as in urban areas. Moreover, restoration projects should be properly monitored to assess whether restoration has been successful, thus enabling adaptive management and learning for the future from both successful and unsuccessful restorations.Show less"
26,"Zhang, C",,"Evaluation of river longitudinal connectivity based on landscape pattern and its application in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, China",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"River connectivity plays an essential role in maintaining the health and stability of river basin ecosystems. It is of great significance to protect river ecosystems to clarify the effect of water conservancy project construction and operation on river hydrological connectivity. The longitudinal connectivity is affected by the landscape patterns of river, such as the convergence and dispersion of the mid-channel bars and the river areas. This study aims to analyze the impacts of construction and regulation of Xiaolangdi Dam on the connectivity of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River from the perspective of landscape pattern. An improved longitudinal river connectivity evaluation method was proposed by accounting for the influence of the landscape pattern represented by mid-channel bars based on barrier coefficient method, and then was applied to analyze the connectivity pre- and post-dam construction. The results show that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation of the river were greatly reduced and tended to be stable. The aggregation degree of mid-channel bars was reduced, and the distribution of mid-channel bars was more dispersed. The river longitudinal connectivity before and after the construction of the Xiaolangdi Dam were 1.35 and 1.50 respectively, indicating an increased river longitudinal connectivity. Overall, there are differences in connectivity before and after Xiaolangdi Dam construction, and connectivity fluctuates after dam construction. Because of the dam regulation of water and sediment, the river connectivity during the flood season increased significantly, and was greater than that before and after the flood season. The longitudinal connectivity evaluation method established in this study is accurate and efficient, and provides an intuitive and reliable new method for quantitatively analyzing the changing laws and characteristics of river connectivity.Show less"
27,"Yu, K",Jan 2020 ,"Watershed-scale distributions of heavy metals in the hyporheic zones of a heavily polluted Maozhou River watershed, southern China",CHEMOSPHERE,"Hyporheic zone (HZ) sediments in river systems are often contaminated with heavy metals as a legacy of natural processes and anthropogenic activities. The geochemical behaviors of heavy metals in the HZ sediments at the laboratory scale have been extensively studied. However, the watershed-scale distributions of heavy metals in the HZ sediments and the processes controlling their distributions have not been well studied. Here, we report a watershed-scale study of heavy metals (i.e., Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) distributions in the HZ of the Maozhou River watershed, a heavily polluted area within the Pearl River Delta, southern China. Statistical analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of studied heavy metal concentrations was highly correlated with that of the sediment-associated sulfide at the watershed-scale. Metal extraction analysis and double-spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope imaging (Cs-STEM) further confirmed the strong association of heavy metals with sulfur. These observations demonstrated that the formation of metals-sulfide precipitates was the key process controlling the watershed-scale distributions of heavy metals (especially for Cr, Ni and Zn) in the HZ sediments. Additionally, high permeability of the HZ sediments may prevent Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb accumulation in sediments. Specially, Cu distribution was mainly affected by organic-Cu complexation. In the estuary area, salinity input likely affected the distributions of Ni, Zn and Cd through cation exchange processes. The findings improved our understanding of the distributions of heavy metals and the processes controlling their distributions at the watershed-scale, and have implications for remediating and managing contaminated HZ sediments.

Disentangling hyporheic influences on temperature cycles in stream channels",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We monitored summertime base flow water temperatures of hyporheic discharge to surface water in main, side, and spring channels located within the bank-full scour zone of the gravel-and cobble-bedded Umatilla River, Oregon, USA. Diel temperature cycles in hyporheic discharge were common, but spatially variable. Relative to the main channel's diel cycle, hyporheic discharge locations typically had similar daily mean temperatures, but smaller diel ranges (compressed by 2 to 6 degrees C) and desynchronized phases (offset by 0 to 6 h). In spring channels (which received only hyporheic discharge), surface water diel cycles were also compressed (by 2 to 6 degrees C) and desynchronized (by -4 to 6 h) relative to the main channel, creating diverse daytime and nighttime mosaics of surface water temperatures across main, side, and spring channels, despite only minor differences (<1 degrees C) in daily mean temperatures among the channels. The river's hyporheic zone received and stored heat from the channel, yet hyporheic return flows carried heat back to the channel minutes to months after removal. Associated surface water temperature dynamics were therefore complex. Hyporheic discharge was not simply ""cooler'' or ""warmer'' than main channel water. Instead, instantaneous temperature differences between channel water and hyporheic discharge typically arose from diel temperature cycles in hyporheic discharge that were buffered and lagged relative to diel cycles in the main channel.Show less"
29,"Branco, P",Aug 2013 ,Boulders as building blocks: improving habitat and river connectivity for stream fish,ECOHYDROLOGY,"Fragmentation of freshwater systems is one of the more common human-induced impacts on the environment, and one of the most dramatic because it leads to disconnections among riverine habitats, severely affecting fish populations. To counter this form of ecological abuse, there has been a significant increase of the number of restoration actions. This work approached stream restoration from a holistic point of view, combining habitat modelling with laboratory experimental research. A 2D hydrodynamic model was used to test the increase in weighted usable area (WUA) created by different boulder placement (BP) scenarios in a disturbed site, with a widespread potamodromous cyprinid fish - the Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) - as the target species. This was complemented by experimental trials in a full-scale experimental fishway with different bottom substrata arrangements, in order to assess the effects of boulders on barbel movements. Results show that instream BP increases WUA for barbel and facilitates fishway negotiation. The findings reflect the importance of placing instream boulders in fragmented systems in order to enhance suitable habitat area and river connectivity. However, BP must be specifically designed for each case and should always be preceded by a comprehensive study for each site and target fish species.

30,"Yan, AL",Apr 2022 ,Reactive Transport of NH4+ in the Hyporheic Zone from the Ground Water to the Surface Water,WATER,"Nowadays, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+) pollution gets more and more attention in drinking water sources. This study investigated the main behavior of biogeochemical NH4+ from groundwater to surface water in a hyporheic zone (HZ) sediment from a reservoir. The experiments were conducted using synthetic groundwater to investigate ammonium transformation. The results indicated that ammonium concentration decreased, apparently resulting from the influence of microbial oxidation and ion exchange with Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+. However, all the ammonium in the sediment was oxidized, then the adsorbed NH4+ became bioavailable by being released back when NH4+ concentration decreased in the aqueous phase. The results showed NH4+ behavior in a HZ where the aerobic and anaerobic environments frequently exchange, with different hydrological conditions controlled by a strong coupling between microbial activities, geochemistry, hydrology, and ion exchange.Show less"
31,"Fauvet, G",2001 ,"Influence of benthic and interstitial processes on nutrient changes along a regulated reach of a large river (Rhone River, France)",HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Benthic and hyporheic (i.e. the water-saturated interstitial zone beneath river bed-sediments) processes together modify particulate and dissolved nutrient fluxes in streams, but the relative importance of these processes remains unstudied in large rivers. Changes in material and nutrient fluxes (total suspended matter, biodegradable and refractory dissolved organic carbon, and nitrate) were monitored along a reach with a regulated discharge (a by-passed section downstream of a dam). Mass balance diagrams highlight a contrasting functioning between upstream and downstream parts of this sector of the Rhone River (Pierre-Benite sector, France). At the upstream location close to the water input, characterized by partially clogged sediments and large lentic zones, decrease in total suspended matter (TSM) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) fluxes resulted from high rates of benthic processes (i.e. sedimentation, respiration and mineralisation). At the downstream location, characterized by strong vertical water exchanges in a large riffle, nutrient changes resulted from the combination of processes that took place at the surface of the stream bed and during water percolation through riffle sediments. Physical benthic processes (scouring of periphyton, erosion and resuspension of sediment due to higher surface velocity) lead to an increase of TSM and DOC fluxes. Within the riffle, decomposition and mineralisation of organic matter in the first meter of the infiltration zone, and physical entrapment of RDOC, make the riffle as a sink for DOC and a source of nitrate. The significant contribution of the riffle to the self-purification capacities of this large river reach shows the relevance of including interstitial compartment in self-purification studies.Show less"

Terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs) that are used in respiration of organic C in anoxic environments may have a strong effect on nutrient dynamics and water chemistry. Concentrations of oxidized and reduced forms of terminal electron accepters (dissolved O-2, NO3-, Fe2+, SO42-, and CH4) were measured in networks of vertically nested wells installed beneath the surface stream and in the near-stream aquifer of a headwater catchment. Tracer addition experiments were conducted in surface and groundwater environments of a Ist-order montane stream to characterize hydrologic fluxes between the stream and aquifer, and to quantify ecosystem retention of terminal electron accepters (NO3- and SO42-) in the GW-SW ecotone. Sulfate retention was evident in both hyporheic and groundwater environments. Distribution of important redox sensitive solutes varied predictably with changing hydrologic residence time of water in the GW-SW ecotone. Results suggest a strong hydrologic control of TEAPs and ecosystem retention of biologically important solutes in the GW-SW ecotone related to characteristics of GW-SW mixing and residence time of water in the hyporheic zone.Show less"

Despite its importance in freshwater ecosystems in terms of services provided, the hyporheic zone has often been overlooked as a research topic. This study assessed the impact of cattle access to headwater streams on hyporheic zone parameters. The results indicate increases in levels of interstitial, hyporheic fine sediment downstream of cattle access points and the potential for this to negatively affect hyporheic invertebrate communities. Invertebrate community composition changes were observed at some sites with changes representing a shift to less diverse communities of smaller bodied invertebrates. The results presented here should help inform water resources managers and encourage them to consider the hyporheic zone as a part of an integrated freshwater ecosystem.Show less"
35,"Dascher, ED",Oct 2 2019 ,"Modeling River Connectivity Using the Barrier Assessment Tool and Available Data on Registered Dams in the Guadalupe-San Antonio River System, Texas",PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER,"The rate of dam building has declined in the United States, but dam building is still considered an integral part of water supply management, particularly in arid and semiarid regions. Understanding how dams affect river connectivity is a key component of river basin management. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of fragmentation in the Guadalupe-San Antonio River System (GSARS) and how these patterns were related to dam size, age, and purpose. Using a shapefile of registered dams and the National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution (NHD-HR) as input data for the Barrier Assessment Tool (BAT), six successive connectivity models were created. The average length of functional river networks (FRNs) decreased over time but the number of FRNs over 100km stayed relatively stable. Fragmentation in the GSARS was concentrated around urban centers, and the majority of fragmentation occurred gradually as dams separated small FRNs along tributaries and headwaters. This gradual decline in longitudinal connectivity was punctuated by sporadically large separations of river networks by particular dams based on their location and time of commissioning. The methodology presented here provides a way to analyze both the extent and the temporal evolution of fragmentation in a river system.Show less"
36,"Mathers, KL",Oct 2021 ,Artificial flood reduces fine sediment clogging enhancing hyporheic zone physicochemistry and accessibility for macroinvertebrates,,"River regulation globally has reduced the riverine connectivity (longitudinal, lateral and vertically) with significant consequences for their abiotic and biotic components. To restore the ecological integrity of regulated rivers, artificial floods are increasingly being employed in large-scale flow restoration efforts. Despite considerable recognition regarding the ecological and geomorphological effects of artificial floods on benthic habitats, understanding the implications for the hyporheic zone is essentially absent. This void in our management knowledge base is considerable given that one of the most widely associated consequences of flow regulation is excessive deposition of fine sediment (sedimentation; particles <2 mm) that often disconnects the hyporheic zone from surface waters. In this study, we examined the effects of an artificial flood on the hyporheic zone of the River Spol in Switzerland. Fine sediment content of shallow benthic substrates (ca. 10 cm) was significantly reduced following the flood. The flushing of fine sediment was also apparent in hyporheic substrates (depths of 0.25 and 0.50 m), resulting in a reconnection of previously clogged interstitial pathways. The opening of interstitial pore space enhanced physicochemical conditions in the hyporheic zone, such as improved dissolved oxygen concentrations, and supported greater taxa richness. Alterations in the composition of shallower hyporheic assemblages (0.25 m) were evident following the flood. These results indicated that benthic pore space became more connected to surface waters following the flood, thereby enhancing accessibility for interstitial organisms. Our results suggest that artificial floods can be an effective management tool to restore spatial heterogeneity in sediment composition and pore space and improve vertical connectivity for macroinvertebrates. We anticipate that artificial floods would be required on a regular basis given the re-accumulation of fine sediment 10 months later in our study system. We encourage river managers and scientists to consider flow disturbance and restoration in a holistic manner that encompasses the multiple spatial dimensions of connectivity, including the hyporheic ecotone.Show less"
37,"Strauch, AM",,Population response to connectivity restoration of high elevation tropical stream reaches in Hawai'i,CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE,"Tropical island streams are heavily impacted by water withdrawals to the detriment of native ecosystems. Freshwater fauna in the tropics often exhibit diadromous life-history strategies, requiring hydrologic connectivity between upstream and nearshore habitats. During some or most of the year, this connectivity is generally lost at points of water withdrawal, typically constructed as a low-head dam diversion. In 2010, instream flow standards (i.e., minimum environmental flows) were established for streams in East Maui, Hawai'i, which led to the partial restoration of flow in certain streams. In 2016, flow in several of these streams was then fully restored. We surveyed 10 streams before (2012) and after (2017) varying degrees of flow restoration (none, partial, full) to explore the short-term consequences of reestablishing natural streamflow for the migratory fauna of high-elevation tropical streams. Using visual point-quadrat surveys, we quantified density and habitat usage of the endemic atyid shrimp (Atyoida bisulcata) and sampled A. bisulcata populations using seine-netting to assess size frequency, sex ratio, percent ovigerous (egg bearing) females, and percent juveniles. In streams with full flow restoration, shrimp density increased in 2017 compared to 2012, while mean body size declined, suggesting increased recruitment following restoration. By contrast, streams that did not experience any flow restoration had similar shrimp densities and body sizes across years. Further, the male: female ratio declined from 18:1 in 2012 to 6.5:1 in 2017, suggesting an increase in reproductive potential of the population. Our results demonstrate that freshwater ecosystems upstream of diversion structures may respond rapidly to the restoration of hydrologic connectivity via increased recruitment of amphidromous species.Show less"
38,"Storey, RG",Feb 1999 ,Perspectives and predictions on the microbial ecology of the hyporheic zone,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Studies of hyporheic microbial ecology have suggested an important role for hyporheic microbial processes in stream ecosystem functioning. Using evidence from microbial communities in other aquatic habitats, some predictions are made concerning the diversity of microbial types and microbial processes likely to occur in the hyporheic zone, and the relative importance of these various types to the hyporheic ecosystem.2. It is predicted that the biofilm growth form of interstitial micro-organisms will create a variety of microniches, allowing coexistence of a great diversity of microbial types, and promoting the activity of some otherwise poor competitors. It is further predicted that the confluence of reduced groundwaters and aerobic surface waters will favour chemolithotrophic processes in the hyporheic zone, but that these will contribute significantly to hyporheic production only if surface water is very low in dissolved organic carbon, or the groundwater is extremely reduced, such as by the influence of riparian wetlands. A variety of anaerobic respiratory pathways, such as nitrate, ferric ion, sulphate and even methanogenic respiration will be employed in the hyporheic zone, with biofilm dynamics permitting these to occur even in aerobic sediments. Anaerobic pathways may account for a significant proportion of total hyporheic organic matter mineralization.3. The role of fungi in hyporheic dynamics is, as yet, almost completely unstudied. However, it is expected that they will be important in breaking down buried particulate organic matter (POM), which may account for a large proportion of total stream POM.4. Physicochemical conditions in hyporheic sediments appear to be highly heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity may be very important in the cycling of certain nutrients, especially nitrogen, which involves a series of steps requiring different conditions.5. Various new techniques are now available by which biofilm dynamics and in situ microbial processes may be measured. Studies are recommended of intact microbial communities both at the microscale of the biofilm and at the scale of the heterogeneities occurring in hyporheic sediments. Studies are needed that measure actual rates of microbial processes under in situ conditions.Show less"

The most notable finding is hybrid exchange, a synergistic hybrid of transaction and gift-giving.Practical implications - The authors recommend that both streamers and streaming platforms acknowledge and accommodate both transactional and relational tipping motivations. The authors also recommend platforms to recruit skillful streamers with high emotional intelligence to better convert perfunctory tippers into tippers who tip more generously.Originality/value - The result of hybrid exchange suggests going beyond the traditional commodity vs gift dichotomy to examine the potential market-gift complementary in a single exchange in the sharing economy.Show less"

Little is known about biofilm development and organic matter content of lateral subsurface (i.e., parafluvial) environments and hyporheic habitats (upwelling and downwelling zones). Eighteen experimental baskets containing river rocks were paired by treatment in which I basket was supplemented with wood (six 7.2 cm X 12 cm strips of oak wood veneer). Nine pairs of baskets were buried 12 to 15 cm below the surface in Gallina Creek, a 1st-order mountain stream in northern New Mexico in late summer 1997. Three pairs were buried beneath the stream bank (i.e., parafluvial zone) and 6 pairs were buried in the hyporheic zone. Baskets were distributed along upwelling and downwelling readies to assess the potential hydrologic influence of subsurface-surface exchange. Open baskets of wood veneer were placed on the streambed surface to compare fungal biomass on the surface with the subsurface. Wood in both hyporheic and parafluvial baskets was colonized by fungi, but fungal biomass was significantly greater on wood in surface water than in hyporheic and parafluvial zones. In addition, fungal biomass on hyporheic wood was significantly greater than on parafluvial wood. A similar pattern (i.e., surface > hyporheic > parafluvial) was observed for dissolved oxygen. In contrast, concentrations of retained particulate organic matter were significantly higher in the parafluvial than the hyporheic zone. Invertebrate densities were significantly greater in baskets supplemented with wood and were greater in the hyporheic zone than in the parafluvial zone. Our data suggest that wood and associated microbial biofilms represent an important food resource for interstitial invertebrate communities.Show less"

42,"Boulton, A",2004 ,Of spates and species: responses by interstitial water mites to simulated spates in a subtropical Australian river,EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY,"The 'hyporheic refuge hypothesis' predicts that the hyporheic zone, the saturated sediments below and alongside rivers and streams, is a refuge from the scouring effects of spates for many aquatic invertebrates including water mites. We tested this hypothesis in two lateral gravel bars and two riffles in a subtropical Australian river by collecting water mites from the hyporheic zone at two depths (10 and 50 cm) at two 'pre-flood' sampling times before experimentally diverting water through the sites for 14 h to simulate a spate. Taxon richness of mites washigh (46 taxa) and dominated by the Prostigmata, with nearly half the species being new to science. Oribatids were also common at the four sites. Samples were collected twice during each 'spate', and again soon after flow was returned to normal. The experimental spate induced changes in the strength and even direction of subsurface-surface water exchange; however, these changes seldom persisted after the experiment, nor after a subsequent natural spate. The hyporheic refuge hypothesis was not supported by our water mite data. Neither during nor shortly after the experimental spates did we find more epigean (surface-dwelling) water mites in downwelling zones where surface streamwater enters the hyporheic zone, demonstrating that these mites were not using the hyporheic zone as a refuge at these locations. There was also no evidence for a 'wash out' effect, because hyporheic mitedensities did not significantly decline late in the spate. Our data indicate that floods of the low magnitude simulated in this study apparently do not pose a lasting disturbance for hypogean water mites. The fact that the same response was found at four sites indicates that the hyporheic refuge hypothesis may not always be an appropriate explanation for rapid post-flood recolonisation. Possibly, the use of the hyporheic zone as a refuge from floods may be dictated by the strength of the disturbance and substrate composition and stability.Show less"
43,"Nadeau, TL",Feb 2007 ,Hydrological connectivity between headwater streams and downstream waters: How science can inform policy,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"In January 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers exceeded its statutory authority by asserting Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdiction over non-navigable, isolated, intrastate waters based solely on their use by migratory birds. The Supreme Court's majority opinion addressed broader issues of CWA jurisdiction by implying that the CWA intended some ""connection"" to navigability and that isolated waters need a ""significant nexus"" to navigable waters to be jurisdictional. Subsequent to this decision (SWANCC), there have been many lawsuits challenging CWA jurisdiction, many of which are focused on headwater, intermittent, and ephemeral streams. To inform the legal and policy debate surrounding this issue, we present information on the geographic distribution of headwater streams and intermittent and ephemeral streams throughout the U.S., summarize major findings from the scientific literature in considering hydrological connectivity between headwater streams and downstream waters, and relate the scientific information presented to policy issues surrounding the scope of waters protected under the CWA. Headwater streams comprise approximately 53% (2,900,000 km) of the total stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska, and intermittent and ephemeral streams comprise approximately 59% (3,200,000 km) of the total stream length and approximately 50% (1,460,000 km) of the headwater stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska. Hillslopes, headwater streams, and downstream waters are best described as individual elements of integrated hydrological systems. Hydrological connectivity allows for the exchange of mass, momentum, energy, and organisms longitudinally, laterally, vertically, and temporally between headwater streams and downstream waters. Via hydrological connectivity, headwater, intermittent and ephemeral streams cumulatively contribute to the functional integrity of downstream waters; hydrologically and ecologically, they are a part of the tributary system. As this debate continues, scientific input from multiple fields will be important for policymaking at the federal, state, and local levels and to inform water resource management regardless of the level at which those decisions are being made. Strengthening the interface between science, policy, and public participation is critical if we are going to achieve effective water resource management.Show less"
44,"Liu, Y",Apr 2022 ,"Roles of Tidal Cycling, Hyporheic Exchange and Bioirrigation on Metal Release From Estuary Sediments",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A numerical model is developed to investigate metal release from estuarine sediments. The model includes three-dimensional (3D) large-eddy simulation of water above the sediment-water interface, 3D advective and diffusive transport within sediments by both physical and biological processes (bioturbation and bioirrigation), and biogeochemical processes within the sediment including reduction of electron acceptors, acid-base reactions, and metal sorption and precipitation. The model was applied to explore the influence of overlying water chemistry and sediment chemical, physical and biological processes on metal release from sediments. Overlying water conditions (pH, salinity, oxygen saturation) may vary diurnally due to tidal cycling and control the short-term release of metals, while over longer times (months), metals are controlled by long-term averages of sediment convective processes (groundwater upwelling, hyporheic exchange and bioirrigation). Metal release is significantly enhanced when there is bioroughness and bioirrigation due to local oxidation of surficial sediments.Show less"
45,"Ibrahim, A",Aug 1 2020 ,Estimating the Hyporheic Depth Beneath a Pool-Riffle Bedform Using the Rankine Body Analytical Method,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The hyporheic zone connects groundwater and surface water allowing active exchange of water and solute, and thus plays a vital role in many hydrological and ecological processes. Many sophisticated high-dimensional models have been developed to study the hyporheic zone, but they require extensive site information and may involve significant time and effort to set up. This emphasizes the need for a preliminary characterization. This paper proposes an analytical model based on the Rankine body method to estimate the maximum hyporheic depth using minimal site information. The hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium is not needed, and for thick alluvium it is not necessary to know the location of any underlying impervious layer. Applied to an idealized pool-riffle sequence, the proposed method is able to calculate the maximum hyporheic depth to within 20% of those from a two-dimensional (2D) reference numerical model for a wide range of conditions. Comparable results are also achieved with other independent studies for hyporheic zone under various bedforms, surface flows, and alluvium conditions. The proposed method provides a quick estimate of the hyporheic depth, which would be useful in the design of a field data collection program and/or a numerical modeling study.Show less"
46,"Malama, B",Feb 2021 ,Assessing Stream-Aquifer Connectivity in a Coastal California Watershed,WATER,"We report the results of field and laboratory investigations of stream-aquifer interactions in a watershed along the California coast to assess the impact of groundwater pumping for irrigation on stream flows. The methods used include subsurface sediment sampling using direct-push drilling, laboratory permeability and particle size analyses of sediment, piezometer installation and instrumentation, stream discharge and stage monitoring, pumping tests for aquifer characterization, resistivity surveys, and long-term passive monitoring of stream stage and groundwater levels. Spectral analysis of long-term water level data was used to assess correlation between stream and groundwater level time series data. The investigations revealed the presence of a thin low permeability silt-clay aquitard unit between the main aquifer and the stream. This suggested a three layer conceptual model of the subsurface comprising unconfined and confined aquifers separated by an aquitard layer. This was broadly confirmed by resistivity surveys and pumping tests, the latter of which indicated the occurrence of leakage across the aquitard. The aquitard was determined to be 2-3 orders of magnitude less permeable than the aquifer, which is indicative of weak stream-aquifer connectivity and was confirmed by spectral analysis of stream-aquifer water level time series. The results illustrate the importance of site-specific investigations and suggest that even in systems where the stream is not in direct hydraulic contact with the producing aquifer, long-term stream depletion can occur due to leakage across low permeability units. This has implications for management of stream flows, groundwater abstraction, and water resources management during prolonged periods of drought.Show less"
47,"Diaz-Redondo, M",Sep 2018 ,Targeting lateral connectivity and morphodynamics in a large river-floodplain system: The upper Rhine River,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"As a consequence of historical damming and channelization, most large rivers are disconnected from their floodplains, which therefore endure severe deficits in fluvial dynamics. Regaining some degree of lateral connectivity can lead to improved geomorphological and biological interactions. Yet, it is necessary to take into account limitations posed by current uses and legislation. This study presents a methodological approach to the selection of a realistic restoration target for a heavily modified large river segment, the free-flowing Upper Rhine River downstream of Iffezheim dam (France-Germany border), based on the analysis of the existing biogeomorphic deficits, constraints set by human uses, and previous restoration experiences. To achieve the selected restoration target, proposed scenarios include embankment removal, bank lowerings, and side channel widenings with the aim of increasing lateral hydrological connectivity and promoting morphodynamics (bank erosion in lateral channels) that allow for the renewal of floodplain habitats. Results from 2-D hydraulic simulations allow for a sensitivity analysis, comparing the current situation with the proposed scenarios, through parameters such as shore length of side channels actively connected at both ends to the main channel (eupotamon), and shear stress as a proxy for initiation of gravel erosion. Outcomes indicate that the two proposed restoration scenarios would succeed in reconnecting side channels and in increasing areas prone to substrate erosion, while maintaining flood protection and the heaviest navigation use among European rivers. The presented approach aids in the assessment of potential large river restoration scenarios and, thus, in the discussion of water management strategies.Show less"

49,"Tonina, D",Feb 2015 ,Benthic Uptake Rate due to Hyporheic Exchange: The Effects of Streambed Morphology for Constant and Sinusoidally Varying Nutrient Loads,WATER,"Hyporheic exchange carries reactive solutes, which may include biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO) and reactive dissolved inorganic nitrogen (Nr), into the sediment, where biochemical reactions consume DO. Here, we study the impact of streambed morphology, stream-reactive solute loads and their diel oscillations on the DO benthic uptake rate (BUR) due to hyporheic processes. Our model solves the hyporheic flow field and the solute transport equations analytically, within a Lagrangian framework, considering advection, longitudinal diffusion and reactions modeled as first order kinetics. The application of the model to DO field measurements over a gravel bar-pool sequence shows a good match with measured DO concentrations with an overall agreement of 58% and a kappa index of 0.46. We apply the model to investigate the effects of daily constant and sinusoidally time varying stream BOD, DO and Nr loads and of the morphodynamic parameters on BUR. Our modeling results show that BUR varies as a function of bedform size and of nutrient loads and that the hyporheic zone may consume up to 0.06% of the stream DO at the pool-riffle bedform scale. Daily oscillations of stream BOD and DO loads have small effects on BUR, but may have an important influence on local hyporheic processes and organisms' distribution.Show less"
