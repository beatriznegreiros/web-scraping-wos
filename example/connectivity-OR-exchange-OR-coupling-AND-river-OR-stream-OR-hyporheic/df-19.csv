However, hyporheic zone pollution is widespread all over the world and remediations of hyporheic zones, when polluted by both heavy metals and organics, are challenging. Thus, the mechanisms and application of Calcium peroxide (CaO2) coupled with Zero-valent iron (ZVI) to simultaneously remove cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and acetochlor were investigated in this work. The effects of mass ratio of ZVI and CaO2, initial pH, and water matrices were evaluated. At initial pH 3, with the dosage of 1.5 g.L-1 ZVI and 0.5 g.L-1 CaO2, the removal efficiencies of Cd, Pb, and acetochlor were 96.7%, 99.8%, and 100%, respectively. Acetochlor was degraded into four main byproducts, and the toxicity evaluation indicated that the ecotoxicity of acetochlor was reduced during the degradation by CaO2/ZVI. In column transport experiments, with the mass ratios of ZVI and CaO2 to quartz sand of only 0.13% and 0.05%, the mass recovery efficiencies of Cd, Pb, and acetochlor from the effluent were 42.5%, 10.4%, and 0%, respectively. Cd was removed mainly by the adsorption of ZVI and iron(hydr)oxides (represented Fe3O4 and lepidocrocite); removal of Pb chiefly resulted from ZVI reduction, and hydroxyl radicals derived from the Fenton reaction accounted for acetochlor degradation. This work provides new insights and a facile strategy for in-situ remediations of hyporheic zones polluted simultaneously by heavy metals and organics.Show less"

2,"Buddendorf, WB",Jun 15 2017 ,Metrics to assess how longitudinal channel network connectivity and in-stream Atlantic salmon habitats are impacted by hydropower regulation,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Habitat fragmentation in channel networks and riverine ecosystems is increasing globally due to the construction of barriers and river regulation. The resulting divergence from the natural state poses a threat to ecosystem integrity. Consequently, a trade-off is required between the conservation of biodiversity in channel networks and socio-economic factors including power generation, potable water supplies, fisheries, and tourism. Many of Scotland's rivers are regulated for hydropower generation but also support populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) that have high economic and conservation value. This paper investigates the use of connectivity metrics and weightings to assess the impact of river barriers (impoundments) associated with hydropower regulation on natural longitudinal channel connectivity for Atlantic salmon. We applied 2 different weighting approaches in the connectivity models that accounted for spatial variability in habitat quality for spawning and fry production and contrasted these models with a more traditional approach using wetted area. Assessments of habitat loss using the habitat quality weighted models contrasted with those using the less biologically relevant wetted area. This highlights the importance of including relevant ecological and hydrogeomorphic information in assessing regulation impacts on natural channel connectivity. Specifically, we highlight scenarios where losing a smaller area of productive habitat can have a larger impact on Atlantic salmon than losing a greater area of less suitable habitat. It is recommended that future channel connectivity assessments should attempt to include biologically relevant weightings, rather than relying on simpler metrics like wetted area which can produce misleading assessments of barrier impacts.Show less"
3,"Flipo, N",2014 ,Continental hydrosystem modelling: the concept of nested stream-aquifer interfaces,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Coupled hydrological-hydrogeological models, emphasising the importance of the stream-aquifer interface, are more and more used in hydrological sciences for pluri-disciplinary studies aiming at investigating environmental issues. Based on an extensive literature review, stream-aquifer interfaces are described at five different scales: local [10 cm-similar to 10 m], intermediate [similar to 10 m-similar to 1 km], watershed [10 km(2)-similar to 1000 km(2)], regional [10 000 km(2)-similar to 1 M km(2)] and continental scales [> 10 M km(2)]. This led us to develop the concept of nested stream-aquifer interfaces, which extends the well-known vision of nested groundwater pathways towards the surface, where the mixing of low frequency processes and high frequency processes coupled with the complexity of geomorphological features and heterogeneities creates hydrological spiralling. This conceptual framework allows the identification of a hierarchical order of the multi-scale control factors of stream-aquifer hydrological exchanges, from the larger scale to the finer scale. The hyporheic corridor, which couples the river to its 3-D hyporheic zone, is then identified as the key component for scaling hydrological processes occurring at the interface. The identification of the hyporheic corridor as the support of the hydrological processes scaling is an important step for the development of regional studies, which is one of the main concerns for water practitioners and resources managers.In a second part, the modelling of the stream-aquifer interface at various scales is investigated with the help of the conductance model. Although the usage of the temperature as a tracer of the flow is a robust method for the assessment of stream-aquifer exchanges at the local scale, there is a crucial need to develop innovative methodologies for assessing stream-aquifer exchanges at the regional scale. After formulating the conductance model at the regional and intermediate scales, we address this challenging issue with the development of an iterative modelling methodology, which ensures the consistency of stream-aquifer exchanges between the intermediate and regional scales.Finally, practical recommendations are provided for the study of the interface using the innovative methodology MIM (Measurements-Interpolation-Modelling), which is graphically developed, scaling in space the three pools of methods needed to fully understand stream-aquifer interfaces at various scales. In the MIM space, stream-aquifer interfaces that can be studied by a given approach are localised. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated with two examples. The first one proposes an upscaling framework, structured around river reaches of similar to 10-100 m, from the local to the watershed scale. The second example highlights the usefulness of space borne data to improve the assessment of stream-aquifer exchanges at the regional and continental scales. We conclude that further developments in modelling and field measurements have to be undertaken at the regional scale to enable a proper modelling of stream-aquifer exchanges from the local to the continental scale.Show less"
4,"Schmitt, RJP",May 2016 ,Tracking multiple sediment cascades at the river network scale identifies controls and emerging patterns of sediment connectivity,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Sediment connectivity in fluvial networks results from the transfer of sediment between multiple sources and sinks. Connectivity scales differently between all sources and sinks as a function of distance, source grain size and sediment supply, network topology and topography, and hydrologic forcing. In this paper, we address the challenge of quantifying sediment connectivity and its controls at the network scale. We expand the concept of a single, catchment-scale sediment cascade toward representing sediment transport from each source as a suite of individual cascading processes. We implement this approach in the herein presented CAtchment Sediment Connectivity And DElivery (CASCADE) modeling framework. In CASCADE, each sediment cascade establishes connectivity between a specific source and its multiple sinks. From a source perspective, the fate of sediment is controlled by its detachment and downstream transport capacity, resulting in a specific trajectory of transfer and deposition. From a sink perspective, the assemblage of incoming cascades defines provenance, sorting, and magnitude of sediment deliveries. At the network scale, this information reveals emerging patterns of connectivity and the location of bottlenecks, where disconnectivity occurs. In this paper, we apply CASCADE to quantitatively analyze the sediment connectivity of a major river system in SE Asia. The approach provides a screening model that can support analyses of large, poorly monitored river systems. We test the sensitivity of CASCADE to various parameters and identify the distribution of energy between the multiple, simultaneously active sediment cascades as key control behind network sediment connectivity. To conclude, CASCADE enables a quantitative, spatially explicit analysis of network sediment connectivity with potential applications in both river science and management.Show less"
5,"Wang, DC",Apr 2021 ,Impact analysis of small hydropower construction on river connectivity on the upper reaches of the great rivers in the Tibetan Plateau,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Hydropower construction may alleviate regional power shortages, regulate river water volume, improve energy structure. However, extensive hydropower construction activities can reduce the river connectivity, which will further lead to biodiversity loss and ecological environment degradation. Most impact assessments of river connectivity have concentrated on large hydropower stations, while few on small ones. Through field investigation, this study identified 236 small hydropower stations on the upper reaches of the great rivers in the Tibetan Plateau, including the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers. The authors established a river connectivity impact index (RCII) model to achieve quantitative analysis of the connectivity of each river segment. Four pressure indicators, the Degree of Fragmentation (DOF), the Degree of Flow Utilization (DFU), the Degree of Obstruction (DOO), and the Density of Road (DOR), were set up based on the station's attribute data. The results indicate that the RCII can better express the impact degree of river connectivity with a high correlation coefficient R-2 between the degree of water reduction and the RCII. More than 40.33% of the river reaches were with ""heavy"" RCII values, indicating that the construction of small hydropower stations had some impacts on river connectivity to some extent. Also, we found that DOF and DOR had greater impacts on river connectivity in the study area. The river connectivity impact had great spatial differences, with rivers in the eastern region being the most serious. Furthermore, the greater the damage of river connectivity, the greater the potential for loss of aquatic biodiversity. A framework was set up in our work to quantitatively evaluate the impact of small hydropower station construction on river connectivity, providing strong support for the further ecological river protection and strategic planning.

6,"Lothian, AJ",Dec 2020 ,River connectivity restoration for upstream-migrating European river lamprey: The efficacy of two horizontally-mounted studded tile designs,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Many rivers are heavily fragmented, resulting from anthropogenic cross-channel structures. Cost-effective solutions are needed to restore habitat connectivity for migratory fishes, including those of conservation concern, such as the European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis). Studded material is becoming increasingly used as a low-cost retrofit solution for lamprey passage at sloping weirs, although little is known about the efficacy of the material or what stud arrangements may be most effective. This study tested whether expanding a single-density studded tile (SDT) lane from 1 to 2-m width increased passage success (n(released)= 133), and also compared the passage performance between a SDT lane and a dual-density studded tile (DDT) lane (n(released)= 115) at a sloping weir, using PIT telemetry. No passage was recorded (n(attempted)= 89) at the 2-m wide SDT lane, but 61.6% (n(passed/attempted)= 53/86) passed using DDT/SDT lane combination. However, increased passage efficiency was likely a result of high river flow (Q2.0-Q30.6) during DDT/SDT comparison versus low (Q8.3-Q88.5) while the 2-m wide SDT lane was employed. There was no evidence that passage occurred using solely one stud configuration. It is, therefore, hypothesised that passage of river lamprey at weirs is more dependent on flow regime than the provision of either stud configuration. However, with 46.1% (n(passed/released)= 53/115) of those released during DDT/SDT comparison passing on the instrumented section (10.5% of weir face), the provision of studded tiles may aid in lamprey passage at high flows, presumably as the tiles generate a low-velocity boundary layer that can be utilised as lamprey swim above the studs.Show less"
7,"Passalacqua, P",Jan 15 2017 ,The Delta Connectome: A network-based framework for studying connectivity in river deltas,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Many deltas, including the Mississippi River Delta, have been losing land at fast rates compromising the safety and sustainability of their ecosystems. Knowledge of delta vulnerability has raised global concern and stimulated active interdisciplinary research as deltas are densely populated landscapes, rich in agriculture, fisheries, oil and gas, and important means for navigation.There are many ways of looking at this problem which all contribute to a deeper understanding of the functioning of coastal systems. One aspect that has been overlooked thus far, yet fundamental for advancing delta science is connectivity, both physical (how different portions of the system interact with each other) as well as conceptual (pathways of process coupling).In,this paper, I propose a framework called Delta Connectome for studying connectivity in river deltas based on different representations of a delta as a network. After analyzing the classic network representation as a set of nodes (e.g., bifurcations and junctions or regions with distinct physical or statistical behavior) and links (e.g., channels), I show that from connectivity considerations the delta emerges as a leaky network that continuously exchanges fluxes of matter, energy, and information with its surroundings and evolves over time. I explore each network representation and show through several examples how quantifying connectivity can bring to light aspects of deltaic systems so far unexplored and yet fundamental to understanding system functioning and informing coastal management and restoration. This paper serves both as an introduction to the Delta Connectome framework as well as a review of recent applications of the concepts of network and connectivity to deltaic systems within the Connectome framework.

8,"Bonanno, E",Aug 2021 ,Flow directions of stream-groundwater exchange in a headwater catchment during the hydrologic year,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Understanding near-stream groundwater dynamics and flow directions is important for predicting hillslope-stream connectivity, streamflow generation, and hydrologic controls of streamwater quality. To determine the drivers of groundwater flow in the stream corridor (i.e., the stream channel and the adjacent groundwater in footslopes and riparian areas), we observed the water levels of 36 wells and 7 piezometers along a headwater stream section over a period of 18 months. Groundwater dynamics during events were controlled by the initial position of the groundwater table relative to the subsurface structure. The near-stream groundwater table displayed a fast and pronounced response to precipitation events when lying in fractured bedrock with low storage capacity, and responded less frequently and in a less pronounced way when lying in upper layers with high storage capacity. Precipitation depth, intensity, regolith thickness above the fractured bedrock, and proximity to and elevation above the stream channel also had an effect on the groundwater dynamics, which varied with hydrologic conditions. Our high-frequency and spatially dense measurements highlight the competing influence of groundwater inflow from upslope locations, streamwater level and bedrock properties on the spatiotemporal dynamics of flowpaths in the stream corridor. Near-stream groundwater pointed uniformly towards the stream channel when the stream corridor was hydrologically connected to upslope groundwater. However, local interruptions of the water inflow from upslope locations caused flow reversals towards the footslopes. The direction of near-stream groundwater followed the local fractured bedrock topography during dry hydrologic conditions on a few occasions after events. The outcomes of this research contribute to a better understanding of the drivers controlling spatiotemporal changes in near-stream groundwater dynamics and flow directions in multiple wetness states of the stream corridor.Show less"
9,"Boulton, AJ",Sep 1998 ,"Effects of buried leaf litter and vertical hydrologic exchange on hyporheic water chemistry and fauna in a gravel-bed river in northern New South Wales, Australia",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Large amounts of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) are buried in the sand and gravel beds of many rivers during spates. The effects of these patchily distributed resources on hyporheic invertebrates and water chemistry are poorly understood. Buried CPOM may provide local 'hot-spots' of food for hyporheic detritivores and their predators, alter nutrient supply to nearby sediment biofilms, and generate habitat for some invertebrates.2. To examine potential short-term effects on hyporheic water chemistry, nutrient concentrations and invertebrate assemblage composition, leaf packs were buried in downwelling (surface water infiltrating the hyporheic zone) and upwelling (hyporheic water emerging to the surface) zones at two sites along a gravel-bed river in northern New South Wales. At one site, pits were excavated to simulate leaf burial (procedural control) and plastic 'leaves' were buried to test whether invertebrates might respond to leaves as refuges rather than food. Hyporheic CPOM, sediment size fractions, and interstitial silt content were also quantified at these sites.3. Dry weights of naturally buried CPOM (leaf litter and wood fragments) varied substantially (0.6-71.7 g L-1 sediment). Amounts of CPOM did not differ between up- vs. downwelling zones or between sites. Hyporheic dissolved oxygen saturation was generally high (> 75%), and was lower in upwelling zones. The hyporheos was dominated taxonomically by water mites (approximate to 20 species), whereas small oligochaetes were most abundant (40% of total abundance). Tiny instars of elmid beetle larvae and leptophlebiid mayfly nymphs were also common. Before experimental manipulation, faunal composition differed between up- and downwelling zones. In upwelling zones, bathynellaceans and blind peracarids were found, whereas small individuals of the surface benthos were common in samples from downwelling zones. This validated stratification of the experiment across zones of hydrologic exchange.4. Twenty days after leaf burial, there was no effect of the treatments at either site on changes in most variables, including mean numbers of taxa and individuals per sample. Similarly, changes in faunal composition of the hyporheos in the treatments paralleled those in the controls except for a weak response in the buried leaves treatment in the upwelling zone at site 1. Artificially buried leaf litter does not seem to influence hyporheic water chemistry or fauna at these two sites. It is probable that naturally buried leaf Litter is swiftly processed soon after entrainment and that repeating this experiment immediately after a flood may yield different results.Show less"
10,"Miracapillo, C",Sep 2014 ,Analytical solutions for stream-aquifer flow exchange under varying head asymmetry and river penetration: Comparison to numerical solutions and use in regional groundwater models,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"An analytical approach is presented to characterize the local flow exchange conductance and boundary condition between a stream and a hydraulically connected aquifer. Due to the curvilinear nature of the flow pattern in the vicinity of the stream, with numerical procedures, very fine grids would have to be used in order to secure accurate results. This is a waste of numerical efforts when the solution can be obtained analytically. Here, we show that the local analytical procedure for the determination of the stream-aquifer flow exchange (SAFE) coefficient can be integrated within a regional numerical groundwater model through an original boundary condition. This is a very practical result. With this new approach, it is quite simple to calculate accurately the discharges on the two sides of the river when the heads are different. This is an important capability for example when wells are present near a river. The results show also that the extent of penetration of the stream is a factor in the estimation of the discharges. At the very least, the results can be used to choose a grid size that will yield correct estimates within an a priori selected acceptable level of accuracy.Show less"
11,"Glozier, NE",Mar 2012 ,"Occurrence of glyphosate and acidic herbicides in select urban rivers and streams in Canada, 2007",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Introduction Public and scientific concern has grown over the last decade in Canada over the cosmetic use of pesticides in urban centers. With this in mind, a national survey was designed to monitor eight commonly used herbicides in urban rivers and streams across Canada.Materials and methods To coordinate sample collections across the country, samples were collected monthly on one of two predetermined dates from April to September, 2007 from 19 sites within 16 watersheds, including 15 sites downstream of urban lands and two reference sites. Water samples were also collected approximately three times from each watershed during or after precipitation events. All samples were collected using a common sampling protocol and all were analyzed using the same analytical laboratories.Results and discussion The herbicides 2,4-D, mecoprop, dicamba, glyphosate and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were most frequently detected. Using either herbicide concentrations upstream/downstream of urban centers or bromoxynil and clopyralid as indictors of agricultural inputs of herbicides to streams, it was clear that environmental concentrations of these herbicides downstream of urban areas were linked to urban use in Canada. Herbicide concentrations in streams draining urban areas were greater during or after significant rainfall events and, with the exception of glyphosate, were significantly greater in the Province of Ontario. Herbicide concentrations were not correlated to the proportion of the watersheds in urban land use. Also, there was no difference in seasonal patterns of herbicide concentrations across urban centers when grouped in five geographic areas. None of the herbicide concentrations measured exceeded existing Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for the protection of aquatic life.Conclusions This is the first time a national survey of pesticides in urban rivers has been carried out in a consistent fashion across Canada. Concentrations of 2,4-D, mecoprop, dicamba, glyphosate, and AMPA were linked to urban use and frequently detected in all geographic areas. However, geographic differences in concentration suggested differences in usage or stream connectivity patterns among urban centers. Some jurisdictions in Canada have recently restricted cosmetic use of pesticides and it would be interesting to determine whether such restrictions will lead to reduced pesticide concentrations in urban streams.Show less"
12,"Li, MJ",Jun 2020 ,Nitrate bioreduction dynamics in hyporheic zone sediments under cyclic changes of chemical compositions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hyporheic zone (HZ) is the hotspot of contaminant biotransformation in ecosystems that affects water quality in both groundwater and river water. HZ is characterized by its dynamic changes in water flow direction that lead to the cyclic changes in aqueous chemical compositions such as dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and their concentrations. Here we report a study on the effects of cyclic changes in the chemical conditions on the rates of nitrate bioreduction in sediments from a hyporheic zone, and the corresponding dynamics of the synthesis and decay of nitrate reductases. The results indicated that the rate of nitrate bioreduction in the second and third cycles was faster than that in the first one because the nitrate reductases produced in the first cycle still partially maintained their reactivity. The presence of DO significantly decreased the rates of nitrate reduction and nitrate reductase synthesis, but such an inhibition effect diminished in the later cycle. The coupled changes in nitrate concentrations and functional enzymes and genes abundances were generally consistent with an enzyme-based biogeochemical kinetic model. Overall the results indicated that enzyme growth dynamics and functions were complexly affected by the cyclic changes of environmental conditions, and implied that HZ sediments have a memory-type system behavior in reducing nitrate that would be affected by the frequency and magnitude of groundwater and river water exchanges, and chemical compositions in the groundwater and river water.Show less"
13,"Johnson, ZC",Oct 2015 ,A numerical investigation of the potential impact of stream restoration on in-stream N removal,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Wastewater treatment plants are common point sources of nutrients to streams. Excess loading of nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N), can result in significant water quality degradation. Where stream loading cannot be increased by water quality trading with other point or nonpoint sources, stream restoration may be an alternative means for point sources to increase loading while maintaining or improving stream health by increasing in-stream N removal via denitrification. However, the primary drivers of nitrogen removal are currently not well understood and thus optimizing restoration efforts is difficult. A two-storage zone transport model with Michaelis-Menten uptake kinetics was applied to a river system based on the Truckee River of Nevada to simulate N removal for multiple restoration scenarios and different types of nitrogen loading. Rates of N removal were found to be most sensitive to the size of the hyporheic zone (AHTS) and maximum denitrification rate in the hyporheic zone (U'(max,HTS)), followed by the half-saturation concentration for denitrification (K-m,K-HTS). Graphs that incorporate the ranges of these three parameters indicate the potential effectiveness of restoration activities for increasing N removal. Combining restoration targets (e.g., increasing A(HTS), sinuosity, width-to-depth ratio, etc.) provided more N removal than the sum of N removal from the individual targets. The relative fractions of the three nitrogen species (dissolved organic-N, total ammonia-N, and nitrate-N) was found to significantly affect a stream's potential to remove N. Together, these results can be used to help guide stream restoration activities to increase a stream's N removal capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
14,"Xia, XH",Feb 1 2017 ,Enhanced nitrogen loss from rivers through coupled nitrification-denitrification caused by suspended sediment,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Present-day estimations of global nitrogen loss (N-loss) are underestimated. Commonly, N-loss from rivers is thought to be caused by denitrification only in bed-sediments. However, coupled nitrification-denitrification occurring in overlying water with suspended sediments (SPS) where oxic and anoxic/low oxygen zones may coexist is ignored for N-loss in rivers. Here the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers were taken as examples to investigate the effect of SPS, which exists in many rivers of the world, on N loss through coupled nitrification-denitrification with nitrogen stable (N-15) isotopic tracer simulation experiments and in-situ investigation. The results showed even when SPS was surrounded by oxic waters, there were redox conditions that transitioned from an oxic surface layer to anoxic layer near the particle center, enabling coupled nitrification-denitrification to occur around SPS. The production rate of N-15(2) from (NH4+)-N-15-N (R15N2-production) increased with increasing SPS concentration ([SPS]) as a power function (R15N2-production = a. [SPS](b)) for both the SPS-water and bed sediment-SPS-water systems. The power-functional increase of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria population with [SPS] accounted for the enhanced coupled nitrification-denitrification rate in overlying water. SPS also accelerated denitrification, in bed-sediment due to increased NO3- concentration caused by SPS-mediated nitrification. For these two rivers, 1 g L-1 SPS will lead to N-loss enhancement by approximately 25-120%, and the enhancement increased with organic carbon content of SPS. Thus, we conclude that SPS in overlying water is a hot spot for nitrogen loss in river systems and current estimates of in-stream N-loss are underestimated without consideration of SPS; this may partially compensate for the current imbalance of global nitrogen inputs and sinks.

15,"Brooks, AJ",Sep 2017 ,Do pools impede drift dispersal by stream insects?,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Drift of stream insects is one of the most ubiquitous forms of downstream dispersal and thought to be a key factor influencing the persistence of local populations. Identifying the factors that limit drift dispersal between habitat patches is needed to understand the connectivity of insect populations along river channels.2. We determined whether insects drifting between riffle habitats (i.e. patches of suitable habitat) were impeded by natural, slow-moving pools (i.e. unsuitable habitat), limiting dispersal to the next downstream riffle, by estimating drift rates entering and exiting pools. We also investigated whether the frequency of drift dispersal between riffle habitats decreased with increasing pool size (length, width and depth), resulting from increasing areas of low or zero current velocity and/or distance between habitat patches.3. We found that for the majority of study taxa (7 of the 8 taxa), drift dispersal between riffles was significantly hindered by the intervening pool habitat, supporting our prediction that natural, large slow-moving pools impede the number of invertebrates drifting between riffle habitats. There were three taxa whose drift rates were significantly reduced by increasing pool depth or width-Off-adens hickmani, Austrophlebioides spp. and Austrosimulium spp., and weak relationships (p<.10) were also found for Coloburiscoides munionga and Asmicridea edwardsii. Drift was not associated with pool length for any species, suggesting that hydraulic conditions within a pool limit drift dispersal and not the total distance between riffle habitat patches.4. Overall, our results suggest drift dispersal seems unlikely to be a major mechanism of long distance dispersal, for at least some common insects. These findings indicate that drift may play a more limited role in stream insect dispersal than is commonly considered and that flying adults may therefore have much greater influence on connectivity among populations.Show less"
16,"Zielinski, DP",Oct 2020 ,Single-Stream Recycling Inspires Selective Fish Passage Solutions for the Connectivity Conundrum in Aquatic Ecosystems,BIOSCIENCE,"Barrier removal is a recognized solution for reversing river fragmentation, but restoring connectivity can have consequences for both desirable and undesirable species, resulting in a connectivity conundrum. Selectively passing desirable taxa while restricting the dispersal of undesirable taxa (selective connectivity) would solve many aspects of the connectivity conundrum. Selective connectivity is a technical challenge of sorting an assortment of things. Multiattribute sorting systems exist in other fields, although none have yet been devised for freely moving organisms within a river. We describe an approach to selective fish passage that integrates ecology and biology with engineering designs modeled after material recycling processes that mirror the stages of fish passage: approach, entry, passage, and fate. A key feature of this concept is the integration of multiple sorting processes each targeting a specific attribute. Leveraging concepts from other sectors to improve river ecosystem function may yield fast, reliable solutions to the connectivity conundrum.Show less"
17,"Wondzell, SM",Mar 1996 ,Seasonal and storm dynamics of the hyporheic zone of a 4th-order mountain stream .1. Hydrologic processes,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The objective of this study was to quantify fluxes of ground water and advected channel water through the shallow aquifer adjacent to a 4th-order mountain stream. A network of wells was installed from 1989 to 1992. Water-table elevations were measured seasonally and during storms. These data were used to calibrate MODFLOW, a 2-dimensional groundwater flow model. The fluxes of water through the subsurface were estimated from the head distributions predicted by the model for 8 steady state model runs bracketing the observed range in baseflow conditions, and for 1 transient simulation of a large storm. The overall pattern of subsurface flow changed little over the course of the year, even though the relative flux of advected channel water and ground water changed among seasons and during storms. Apparently the longitudinal gradient of the main valley, the location of the stream, and the influence of secondary channels determined the pattern of subsurface flows. Subsurface fluxes through a gravel bar were dominated by advected channel water but fluxes through the floodplain were dominated by ground water. Flow rates were positively correlated to estimated stream discharge during base-flow periods, but decreased slightly during storms because of precipitation inputs to the aquifer. The mean residence time of water stored within the aquifer was approximately 10 d for the gravel bar and 30 d for the floodplain during baseflow periods. Even though precipitation during the simulated storm equaled 12% and 23% of the water stored in the gravel bar and the floodplain, respectively, the mean residence time of water remained long.Show less"
18,"Gibbins, CN",Feb 2016 ,Influence of groundwater chemistry on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages is revealed by fine-scale sampling,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Relationships between hydrochemistry and invertebrate assemblages were assessed at fine spatial scales within the hyporheic zone of an upland stream. Eighteen stacked colonisation samplers were placed in the streambed and sampled regularly over an 8-month period. Each stack consisted of three individual sampling chambers, positioned at mean depths of 15, 30 and 45 cm below the bed surface. Each chamber had an internal volume of 600 cm(3) and was filled with sediment in the 2-8 mm (b-axis) size range. Water was extracted from each chamber at approximately fortnightly intervals, to characterise its hydrochemistry (dissolved oxygen concentration and alkalinity) and infer the presence of groundwater. Six randomly selected stacks were removed in each of three seasons (winter, spring and summer), with invertebrates present inside then identified and enumerated. Despite marked inter-sample differences in hydrochemistry and the variable presence of groundwater within the hyporheic zone, sampling locations were characterised by broadly similar invertebrate assemblages. Generalised linear mixed models indicated that inter-sample differences in assemblages were primarily related to depth beneath the streambed rather than local hydrochemical conditions, indicating only a limited effect of groundwater discharge on hyporheic communities in this stream. Overall, the chambers revealed finer spatial scale variation than methods used in previous published studies and allowed environmental and ecological characterisation at comparable spatial scales. Future studies using such chambers should seek to increase the number of measured covariates, to better understand the controls on invertebrate assemblages.Show less"
19,"Birnie-Gauvin, K",Jul 2018 ,River connectivity reestablished: Effects and implications of six weir removals on brown trout smolt migration,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Today's river systems have been extensively modified, requiring us to rethink how we approach the management of these important ecosystems. We evaluated the effects of removing 6 weirs in River Villestrup (Jutland, Denmark) on the smolt run of brown trout (Salmo trutta) over the course of 12years. During 5 of these years, we evaluated the number, size, and timing of smolts during their downstream migration. We found an increase in smolt output following the weir removals, along with a decrease in average length and indications of an earlier peak migration. Our results suggest that barrier removal has led to an increase in spawning success by adults, fry survival, recruitment, and smolt migration success. Weir removal is therefore a viable management approach to restore connectivity in freshwater streams and rivers, which promotes the passage of smolts as they migrate to marine environments.Show less"
20,"Jaeger, A",Dec 1 2019 ,Using recirculating flumes and a response surface model to investigate the role of hyporheic exchange and bacterial diversity on micropollutant half-lives,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS,"Enhancing the understanding of the fate of wastewater-derived organic micropollutants in rivers is crucial to improve risk assessment, regulatory decision making and river management. Hyporheic exchange and sediment bacterial diversity are two factors gaining increasing importance as drivers for micropollutant degradation, but are complex to study in field experiments and usually ignored in laboratory tests aimed to estimate environmental half-lives. Flume mesocosms are useful to investigate micropollutant degradation processes, bridging the gap between the field and batch experiments. However, few studies have used flumes in this context. We present a novel experimental setup using 20 recirculating flumes and a response surface model to study the influence of hyporheic exchange and sediment bacterial diversity on half-lives of the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (ACS). The effect of bedform-induced hyporheic exchange was tested by three treatment levels differing in number of bedforms (0, 3 and 6). Three levels of sediment bacterial diversity were obtained by diluting sediment from the River Erpe in Berlin, Germany, with sand (1 : 10, 1 : 1000 and 1 : 100 000). Our results show that ACS half-lives were significantly influenced by sediment dilution and number of bedforms. Half-lives of CBZ were higher than ACS, and were significantly affected only by the sediment dilution variable, and thus by bacterial diversity. Our results show that (1) the flume-setup is a useful tool to study the fate of micropollutants in rivers, and that (2) higher hyporheic exchange and bacterial diversity in the sediment can increase the degradation of micropollutants in rivers.Show less"
21,"Xu, ZX",2004 ,DEVELOPMENT OF COUPLED 1D-2D MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR TIDAL RIVERS,JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS,"Some coupled 1D-2D hydrodynamic and water quality models depicting tidal water bodies with complex topography were presented. For the coupled models, finite element method was used to solve the governing equations so as to study tidal rivers with complex topography. Since the 1D and 2D models were coupled, the principle of model coupling was proposed to account appropriately for the factors of water level, flow and pollutant flux and the related dynamical behavior was simulated. Specifically the models were used to probe quantitative pollution contribution of receiving water from neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces to the pollution in the Huangpu River passing through Shanghai City. Numerical examples indicated that the developed coupled 1D-2D models are applicable in tidal river network region of Shanghai.Show less"
22,"Woelfle-Erskine, C",Feb 2017 ,Abiotic habitat thresholds for salmonid over-summer survival in intermittent streams,ECOSPHERE,"Intermittent streams lose surface flow during part of the year but can provide important habitat for imperiled fishes in residual pools. However, extended intermittency can drive high mortality as pool contraction decreases pool quality, and some pools dry completely. We evaluated the influence of a suite of abiotic habitat characteristics on the over-summer survival of two imperiled salmonid fishes (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch; steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) at four study sites on two tributaries of Salmon Creek (Sonoma County, California, USA) from 2012 to 2014, during deepening drought conditions. Study sites spanned an intermittency gradient from continuous flow to near-dry conditions, and included alluvial and bedrock stream reaches. We estimated over-summer survival at the pool scale from fish presence-absence data based on paired early-late summer snorkel surveys. We measured pool dimensions and water quality parameters monthly (more frequently during summer dry down) and, in 2013 and 2014, recorded water quality with continuous loggers in selected pools. We performed: (1) logistic regression in a generalized linear modeling framework to identify factors limiting over-summer survival and (2) classification trees using the random forests ensemble learning method to identify abiotic thresholds for sustaining sal-monids. Results suggested that different factors governed mortality of the two species. Coho salmon, which tended to survive in large, deep pools, were limited by minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In contrast, steelhead trout, which tended to survive in pools with large surface area, were sensitive to pool geometry and temperature. Both species persisted for weeks in large pools with low DO levels, including in pools where at least part of the water column reached sublethal or lethal levels. Our results suggest that shallow, lateral hyporheic flow may be important for maintaining DO and temperatures suitable for sustaining salmonids in isolated pools, whereas groundwater discharge originating from deeper flow paths may generate low-DO conditions that inhibit salmonid persistence. Geomorphically complex watersheds with a variety of pool geometries and high rates of lateral hyporheic exchange are those most likely to serve as ""sanctuary reaches"" for imperiled Pacific salmonid populations in semi-arid regions in the context of a changing climate.Show less"
23,"Hein, T",Dec 20 2021 ,The coupled socio-ecohydrological evolution of river systems: Towards an integrative perspective of river systems in the 21st century,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River systems have undergone a massive transformation since the Anthropocene. The natural properties of river systems have been drastically altered and reshaped, limiting the use of management frameworks, their scientific knowledge base and their ability to provide adequate solutions for current problems and those of the future, such as climate change, biodiversity crisis and increased demands for water resources. To address these challenges, a socioecologically driven research agenda for river systems that complements current approaches is needed and proposed. The implementation of the concepts of social metabolism and the colonisation of natural systems into existing concepts can provide a new basis to analyse the coevolutionary coupling of social systems with ecological and hydrological (i.e.,'socio-ecohydrological') systems within rivers. To operationalize this research agenda, we highlight four initial core topics defined as research clusters (RCs) to address specific system properties in an integrative manner. The colonisation of natural systems by social systems is seen as a significant driver of the transformation processes in river systems. These transformation processes are influenced by connectivity (RC 1), which primarily addresses biophysical aspects and governance (RC 2), which focuses on the changes in social systems. The metabolism (RC 3) and vulnerability (RC 4) of the social and natural systems are significant aspects of the coupling of social systems and ecohydrological systems with investments, energy, resources, services and associated risks and impacts. This socio-ecohydrological research agenda complements other recent approaches, such as 'socio-ecological', 'socio-hydrological' or 'socio-geomorphological' systems, by focusing on the coupling of social systems with natural systems in rivers and thus, by viewing the socioeconomic features of river systems as being just as important as their natural characteristics. The proposed research agenda builds on interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity and requires the implementation of such programmes into the education of a new generation of river system scientists, managers and engineers who are aware of the transformation processes and the coupling between systems.

Flow velocity measured with tracers is taken as travel time of the water along a straight line between injection and sampling points, although the water flows around sediment particles, and thus travels a somewhat longer distance. From sections of stream sediment in which the interstitial spaces were replaced by concrete, we estimated that this difference amounts, on average, to 27% and used this factor to correct the results of our velocity measurements. Corrected interstitial water velocities ranged from 0.01 to 1.32 cm s(-1) and were independent of surface discharge. We also studied spatial patterns in the bed sediments with long-term tracer injections. The three-dimensional distribution of tracer concentrations 24 hours after the start of the injection indicated that interstitial water preferentially flows in a complex network of areas of high hydraulic connectivity. Reynolds numbers for flow in the hyporheic pore space ranged from 0.1 to 489, implying that the flow environment varies from laminar up to the zone of transition to turbulent flow. Therefore, invertebrates may have a size-related active choice of areas where either friction drag or pressure drag predominates. The consequence of flow patterns, such as those observed in our study, is that small-scale variability of hydraulic conditions may be an important determinant of the patchy invertebrate distribution in bed sediments.Show less"
27,"Maier, HS",Nov-dec 2011 ,Influence of Oscillating Flow on Hyporheic Zone Development,GROUND WATER,"The hyporheic zone is an ecologically important ecotone that describes the extent to which nutrient-rich surface waters penetrate the shallow subsurface adjacent to a flowing surface water body. Although steady-state models satisfactorily explain the incursion of surface water into the subsurface as a function of head gradients developed across streambed riffles, they fail to account for the depth that surface water is observed to penetrate the subsurface or for the extent to which the hyporheic zone develops adjacent to the stream channel. To investigate these issues, transient flow modeling has been conducted at the riffle scale and supported by data for an instrumented site in northern Ontario where stream-stage fluctuations are strictly regulated. Model results show that daily stream-stage fluctuations between 0.6 and 4 m produce oscillating solute flow paths that typically reduce residence times of water and solutes in the hyporheic zone from 60 days or more under steady-state conditions to less than 1 day. Furthermore, similar stream-stage fluctuations increase the depth that solutes pervade the subsurface and banks lateral to the stream from around 1 m under steady-state conditions to as much as 2 and 10 m, respectively. The results demonstrate that the transient flow conditions triggered in the subsurface by variable stream stage can exert a strong influence on hyporheic zone development and have important implications for the hyporheos. The results are especially important for hyporheic communities that may survive gradual changes to their living conditions by migrating to more hospitable aquatic habitats, but are unable to respond to rapid changes provoked by more extreme hydrological events.Show less"
28,"Ghimire, B",Mar 1 2013 ,Hydrograph-based approach to modeling bacterial fate and transport in rivers,WATER RESEARCH,"A new approach, called hydrograph-based approach, is proposed for predicting bacterial concentrations in rivers. The new approach is relatively simple and efficient in terms of data requirements. It uses widely available hydrographs as the main input data for estimating flow and sediment transport parameters responsible for bacterial transport under varying flow conditions. The major component of the hydrograph-based approach is a new model, called VARTBacT model which is an extension of the Variable Residence Time (VART) model by including effects of unsteady flow, sediment transport, and bacterial decay/growth processes on bacterial transport and fate in rivers. The applicability of the new hydrograph-based approach is demonstrated through three case studies, each with distinct sediment and flow conditions: (1) steady low flow without sediment transport, (2) flood events with significant sediment transport due to watershed inputs, and (3) sediment resuspension from the streambed. While the sediment resuspension from streambed may be an important process for bacterial transport during high flows, results from this study indicate that the most important mechanism responsible for bacterial transport in streams is watershed loading during flood events and hyporheic exchange during low flow periods.

29,"Malzone, JM",Mar-apr 2016 ,Temporal Hyporheic Zone Response to Water Table Fluctuations,GROUNDWATER,"Expansion and contraction of the hyporheic zone due to temporal hydrologic changes between stream and riparian aquifer influence the biogeochemical cycling capacity of streams. Theoretical studies have quantified the control of groundwater discharge on the depth of the hyporheic zone; however, observations of temporal groundwater controls are limited. In this study, we develop the concept of groundwater-dominated differential hyporheic zone expansion to explain the temporal control of groundwater discharge on the hyporheic zone in a third-order stream reach flowing through glacially derived terrain typical of the Great Lakes region. We define groundwater-dominated differential expansion of the hyporheic zone as: differing rates and magnitudes of hyporheic zone expansion in response to seasonal vs. storm-related water table fluctuation. Specific conductance and vertical hydraulic gradient measurements were used to map changes in the hyporheic zone during seasonal water table decline and storm events. Planar and riffle beds were monitored in order to distinguish the cause of increasing hyporheic zone depth. Planar bed seasonal expansion of the hyporheic zone was of a greater magnitude and longer in duration (weeks to months) than storm event expansion (hours to days). In contrast, the hyporheic zone beneath the riffle bed exhibited minimal expansion in response to seasonal groundwater decline compared to storm related expansion. Results indicated that fluctuation in the riparian water table controlled seasonal expansion of the hyporheic zone along the planar bed. This groundwater induced hyporheic zone expansion could increase the potential for biogeochemical cycling and natural attenuation.Show less"
30,"Xie, CJ",Oct 15 2020 ,Hydrological connectivity dynamics of tidal flat systems impacted by severe reclamation in the Yellow River Delta,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River deltas contain complex self-organizing channel networks that continuously exchange fluxes of water, matter, energy, and information with their surroundings. The connectivity of these exchange processes plays a crucial role in controlling the evolution and dynamic stability of river deltas. However, connectivity patterns related to tidal channel networks have rarely been studied, especially in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), which is impacted by severe reclamation. Here, we evaluated the potential hydrological connectivity dynamics between the tidal channel network and its surroundings using an index of connectivity (IC) in the whole YRD and its three subregions: erosion zone, oil field zone and deposition zone. The results suggested that different areas had different spatial connectivity potential. The mean value of the IC related to the channel networks showed little difference for any zones. However, the total connectivity response area (CRA; set of connectivity response units) varied with the study scale. A decreasing trend was found on the delta scale and a relatively stable trend was found in the deposition zone. In terms of dynamic connectivity, the tidal flat system did not show a continuous trend over time. Our results indicated that the YRD is such a dynamic complex that a relatively stable connectivity pattern is unlikely to be achieved over time. Therefore, future ecological restoration based on hydrological connectivity needs to consider more related influencing factors and their temporal and spatial dynamics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

31,"Angradi, T",Mar 1998 ,An application of the plaster dissolution method for quantifying water velocity in the shallow hyporheic zone of an Appalachian stream system,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. A method for quantifying interstitial water velocity based on the dissolution rate of plaster of Paris standards was developed as part of a study of vertical, longitudinal (1-4 order sites) and seasonal variation in the biotic and physical characteristics of the shallow hyporheic zone (0-30 cm) of a headwater stream system in West Virginia, U.S.A.2. A calibration model was developed using a water velocity simulation tank to relate mass loss of plaster standards to water velocity and temperature. The model was then used to calculate water velocity through artificial substrata embedded in the shallow hyporheic zone of four stream reaches based on in situ mass loss of plaster standards.3. Water velocity in the hyporheic zone increased with stream order, was highest in early spring and winter during high stream base flows, and decreased with depth into the substratum. There was a strong interaction between depth and season: during periods of high stream discharge, water velocity through the upper level of the shallow hyporheic zone (0-10 cm into the substrate) increased disproportionately more than velocity at greater depths. Mean interstitial velocity in March ranged from 0 cm s(-1) in the lowest level (20-30 cm) to 3.5 cm s(-1) at the upper level (0-10 cm) at the first-order site, and from 2.5 cm s(-1) (20-30 cm) to 9.5 cm s(-1) (0-10 cm s(-1)) at the fourth-order site. Gradients in stream discharge and sediment permeability accounted for treatment effects.4. Use of calibrated data improved the ability to resolve among-season differences in interstitial water movement over the use of uncalibrated mass loss data. For some applications of the plaster standard method, empirical calibration may not be necessary.Show less"
32,"Baruch, EM",Sep 2018 ,Not all pavements lead to streams: variation in impervious surface connectivity affects urban stream ecosystems,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Watershed urbanization leads to chemical and thermal pollution of urban streams and significant declines in aquatic biodiversity. Most investigators have focused on variation in total watershed impervious surface cover (ISC) as the primary driver of urban stream degradation. We asked instead whether the degree of connectivity between ISC and urban stream channels alters its effect. We compared 7 streams in the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area of the southeastern USA that drained watersheds with similar amounts of pavement (ISC = 7-16% of watershed area) but spanning a wide range of hydrologic connectivity between these pavements and their receiving streams via both subsurface (pipe density range: 1.1-6.9 km/km(2)) and surface (road density range: 5.8-10.7 km/ km(2) ) flowpaths. Despite draining watersheds with similarly low levels of development, these 7 streams exhibited remarkable variability in their hydrologic and thermal regimes and varied in their macroinvertebrate diversity from a low of only 11 taxa to a high of 22. Both macroinvertebrate community composition and the tissue concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in 3 stream invertebrate taxa (Cambaridae, Tipulidae, and Hydropsychidae) found across all sites were correlated with watershed hydrologic connectivity. These results suggest that the connectivity of ISC may drive considerable variation in the magnitude of ecosystem degradation associated with the same level of watershed development, with less connected or disconnected impervious surfaces having proportionally lower negative effects on aquatic organisms.Show less"
33,"Huotari, J",Nov 16 2013 ,Efficient gas exchange between a boreal river and the atmosphere,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"The largest uncertainties in accurately resolving the role of rivers and streams in carbon cycling stem from difficulties in determining gas exchange between water and the atmosphere. So far, estimates for river-atmosphere gas exchange have lacked direct ecosystem-scale flux measurements not disturbing gas exchange across the air-water interface. We conducted the first direct riverine gas exchange measurements with eddy covariance in tandem with continuous surface water CO2 measurements in a large boreal river for 30 days. Our measured gas transfer velocity was, on average, 20.8 cm h(-1), which is clearly higher than the model estimates based on river channel morphology and water velocity, whereas our floating chambers gave comparable values at 17.3 cm h(-1). These results demonstrate that present estimates for riverine CO2 emissions are very likely too low. This result is also relevant to any other gases emitted, as their diffusive exchange rates are similarly proportional to gas transfer velocity.Show less"
34,"Ibrahim, A",Feb 2018 ,Comparison of a vertically-averaged and a vertically-resolved model for hyporheic flow beneath a pool-riffle bedform,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The interaction between surface water and groundwater through the hyporheic zone is recognized to be important as it impacts the water quantity and quality in both flow systems. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is the most complete representation of a real-world hyporheic zone. However, 3D modeling requires extreme computational power and efforts; the sophistication is often significantly compromised by not being able to obtain the required input data accurately. Simplifications are therefore often needed. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of the vertically-averaged approximation compared to a more complete vertically-resolved model of the hyporheic zone. The groundwater flow was modeled by either a simple one-dimensional (1D) Dupuit approach or a two-dimensional (2D) horizontal/vertical model in boundary fitted coordinates, with the latter considered as a reference model. Both groundwater models were coupled with a 1D surface water model via the surface water depth. Applying the two models to an idealized pool-riffle sequence showed that the 1D Dupuit approximation gave comparable results in determining the characteristics of the hyporheic zone to the reference model when the stratum thickness is not very large compared to the surface water depth. Conditions under which the 1D model can provide reliable estimate of the seepage discharge, upwelling/downwelling discharges and locations, the hyporheic flow, and the residence time were determined.

35,"Sun, X",Jan 15 2016 ,Improved simulation of river water and groundwater exchange in an alluvial plain using the SWAT model,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hydrological interaction between surface and subsurface water systems has a significant impact on water quality, ecosystems and biogeochemistry cycling of both systems. Distributed models have been developed to simulate this function, but they require detailed spatial inputs and extensive computation time. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model is a semi-distributed model that has been successfully applied around the world. However, it has not been able to simulate the two-way exchanges between surface water and groundwater. In this study, the SWAT-landscape unit (LU) model - based on a catena method that routes flow across three LUs (the divide, the hillslope and the valley) - was modified and applied in the floodplain of the Garonne River. The modified model was called SWAT-LUD. Darcy's equation was applied to simulate groundwater flow. The algorithm for surface water-level simulation during flooding periods was modified, and the influence of flooding on groundwater levels was added to the model. Chloride was chosen as a conservative tracer to test simulated water exchanges. The simulated water exchange quantity from SWAT-LUD was compared with the output of a two-dimensional distributed model, surface-subsurface water exchange model. The results showed that simulated groundwater levels in the LU adjoining the river matched the observed data very well. Additionally, SWAT-LUD model was able to reflect the actual water exchange between the river and the aquifer. It showed that river water discharge has a significant influence on the surface-groundwater exchanges. The main water flow direction in the river/groundwater interface was from groundwater to river; water that flowed in this direction accounted for 65% of the total exchanged water volume. The water mixing occurs mainly during high hydraulic periods. Flooded water was important for the surface-subsurface water exchange process; it accounted for 69% of total water that flowed from the river to the aquifer. The new module also provides the option of simulating pollution transfer occurring at the river/groundwater interface at the catchment scale. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"

Standard protocols to construct road-stream crossing (RSC) reveals that crossing structures at headwater streams of the Kunur River Basin in eastern India are inadequate to maintain longitudinal continuity in channel hydraulics as well as morphology. The role of crossing type (pipe, box, and small bridge) and catchment land cover are also considered for site-wise variation in channel deformation. The detailed geomorphic survey with 10 cross-sections (5 in the upstream and 5 in the downstream of crossing structure) and 1 longitudinal profile from each of the 10 sample sites were used to run one-dimensional flow modelling in Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, statistical analysis of channel morphometry, manning and rational methods for discharge estimation, and hydroengineering equations. Result shows that in comparison with the extreme upstream (50 m upward from RSC), a significant increase in channel width (30%), depth (17%), and cross-section area (54%) has been observed at the immediate upstream and downstream of RSC. Longitudinal profiles of channel bed, water surface, and energy gradient are also showing the development of knick points, deep scours, and supercritical conditions below the crossing structure. The morphological deformation is more prominent at pipe culvert followed by box and bridges, whereas forested catchment has reduced the effect with less runoff than agricultural. Structural enhancement and regular monitoring might be effective in reducing the problems and constructional cost at RSCs.Show less"
38,"Paillex, A",Dec 2007 ,Aquatic macroinvertebrate response along a gradient of lateral connectivity in river floodplain channels,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Large river floodplains potentially include the full range of freshwater ecosystems from permanently flowing channels to temporary pools and springs. Attempts to restore such complex systems require tools adapted to assess restoration success. In an analysis of invertebrate assemblages in the Rhone River floodplain (France), taxonomic-based indices (rarefied richness and assemblage composition) were compared with functional metrics using trait-based ratios as surrogates of ecosystem processes. Their ability to respond to a gradient of hydrological connectivity was assessed in 7 cut-off channels. The sampling design included 2 sites/channel (upstream and downstream), 4 randomly chosen sampling points (0.5 x 0.5-m quadrats)/site, and 2 sampling seasons (spring and summer). Water physicochemical and habitat variables were recorded when invertebrates were sampled. Environmental variables, including water conductance, [NH3-N], submerged vegetation cover, diversity of sediment grain size, and organic matter content of the sediment, were used to construct a synthetic variable describing the hydrological connectivity of each site with the main river channel. A quadratic regression of rarefied taxonomic richness and the connectivity gradient was not quite significant, but assemblage composition was strongly related to the gradient. Four of 8 trait-based metrics; were correlated with the connectivity gradient. Values of metrics that are surrogates for top-down control of assemblage structure and habitat stability (based on functional feeding groups) declined along the gradient from disconnected sites to more connected sites. Values of metrics that are surrogates for voltinism and food supply for water-column-feeding fish increased with connectivity. Top-down control and voltinism surrogates suggested a decline in predator-prey relationships and lower habitat stability, respectively, in the more connected sites. Assemblage composition and some of the trait-based metrics were sensitive to a flood that occurred before one of the sampling dates. Some of the trait-based metrics showed potential for explaining floodplain invertebrate assemblages and for monitoring postrestoration conditions in floodplain water bodies. However, the metrics were developed initially for studies of lotic systems and their use in heterogeneous floodplain water bodies will require further investigation, e.g., delineation of reference conditions for trait-based metrics.Show less"
39,"Gerke, M",Feb 10 2021 ,Can top-down effects of cypriniform fish be used to mitigate eutrophication effects in medium-sized European rivers?,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Eutrophication seriously threatens the ecological quality and biodiversity of running waters. In nutrient-enriched streams and shallow rivers, eutrophication leads to excessive periphyton growth and, in turn, biological clogging, oxygen depletion in the hyporheic zone and finally a reduction in the hyporheic habitat quality. Top-down control of the food-web by manipulating fish stocks, similar to the biomanipulation successfully applied in lakes, offers a promising approach to mitigating the effects of eutrophication in shallow rivers, especially those in which major reductions in nutrient input are not feasible. We conducted a reach-scale experiment over 4 years in a medium-sized eutrophic river to assess whether the top-down effects of two important large European cypriniform fish species, herbivorous common nase (Chondrostoma nasus) and omnivorous European chub (Squalius cephalus), would mitigate the effects of eutrophication. The enhancement of fish stocks was expected to reduce biological clogging, via the top-down control of periphyton by benthic grazing and enhanced bioturbation, thus increasing oxygen availability in the hyporheic zone as well as water exchange between the surface water and the hyporheic zone. As expected, enhancing the stocks of nase and chub increased both oxygen availability and vertical exchange flux of water in the upper layer of the hyporheic zone. However, periphyton biomass (chlorophyll a) was significantly reduced only in deeper pool habitat. Thus, while experimental biomanipulation in a shallow river significantly mitigated the effects of eutrophication in the hyporheic zone, top-down effects on periphyton biomass were rather small. Overall, to our knowledge, our results provide first evidence that the biomanipulation achieved by enhancing herbivorous and omnivorous fish stocks has the potential to mitigate the effects of eutrophication in medium-sized European rivers.

Source water, i.e. water discharged from the estuary during an ebb pulse, overtakes the front as it propagates offshore, resulting in the strong convergence that exists there. Model results show that much of the water released over an ebb pulse does not interact with the propagating tidal plume front, suggesting that the front decouples from the source and sustains itself as a distinct water mass. When a gate is closed at the estuary mouth during early ebb, the overall plume structure changes; gates closed late in ebb do not significantly effect the along- or cross-shore scale of the plume. The change in plume extent is only evident hours after the early-ebb gate closing, when source water is no longer supplied to the front. These experiments suggest that the growing distance between the highly energetic liftoff region and the radial expansion of the plume front results in a flattening of the surface gradient driving flow in the interior, diminishing source-front connectivity.Show less"
43,"Brodie, RS",Jan 30 2008 ,Comparison of daily percentiles of streamflow and rainfall to investigate stream-aquifer connectivity,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A frequency analysis approach was used to investigate the hydraulic connectivity between streams and aquifers, by comparing daily percentiles of streamflow and rainfall. Three Australian streams were examined - a dominantly gaining stream (Wilsons River, NSW), a dominantly gaining stream modified by significant water extraction (Ovens River, Victoria) and a dominantly losing stream (Mooki River, NSW). For the gaining stream examples, a tag is observed between the seasonal peak in the low-flow percentile curves and the seasonal peak in the daily rainfall percentile curve. Cross-correlation was used to calculate the time-shift that provides the best fit between the streamflow and rainfall percentile curves. There is a good correlation (r(2) > 0.8) between the reference rainfall percentile curve and the shifted streamflow percentile curves for gaining streams. The tags evident between the rainfall and streamflow percentile curves represent the processes of first replenishing catchment storages (such as soil moisture and groundwater) and subsequent release to the stream. This is largely a function of catchment hydrogeology as well as climate, notably the magnitude and regularity of rainfall events. Catchment size is not a controlling factor. Analysis of these tags provides insights into the dynamics of groundwater recharge, storage and release. Changes in the tag times over the flow percentiles can reflect changes in the dominant catchment storage contributing to streamflow. For the Wilsons River, the contribution from a groundwater system with longer flow paths increases at lower flow percentiles. This can be critical when protecting minimum streamflows, as near-stream groundwater flow may not be the only determining factor. The impact of water extraction can be recognised in this analysis. For the Ovens River, streamflow deficits relative to the rainfall percentile curve correspond to the summer period of high irrigation demand. Such a deficit was also observed for the Wilsons River when only post-development monitoring was used in the analysis. For the losing stream example of the Mooki River, the relationship between the streamflow and rainfall percentile curves was poor due to the significant number of no-flow days and much greater variability in the gauging record. This is because the recharge component of rainfall is not returned as streamflow over the year and a portion of streamflow can become aquifer leakage. Hence, the calculated tags derived from this analysis have no hydrological significance for losing streams. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
44,"Ryan, RJ",Jan 6 2004 ,Estimation of solute transport and storage parameters in a stream with anthropogenically produced unsteady flow and industrial bromide input,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We used an anthropogenic tracer signal to evaluate downstream solute transport and storage in Valley Creek, a 60 km(2) watershed stream near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that is subject to urbanization and anthropogenically induced unsteady flow. Bromide-bearing groundwater from an abandoned mineral processing plant enters the upstream reach of Valley Creek through a series of well-defined seeps and springs, producing a steady and significant concentration of bromide in Valley Creek. In addition, at the time of the study, a quarry located near the center of the watershed discharged accumulated groundwater seepage to the stream on a cyclical basis. The quarry discharge reduced the bromide concentration in the main stream and produced a periodicity in the in-stream bromide concentration downstream of the quarry. We used these variations in the ambient bromide concentration to assess solute mixing and transport in Valley Creek. We applied the USGS code OTIS to analyze solute advection, dispersion, transient storage, and groundwater inflow over a 7.5 km stream reach. To apply OTIS for unsteady flow conditions, we independently modeled the variation of stream conditions during a flow cycle and then simulated solute transport using temporal and reach average values of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient (D), transient storage exchange rate (alpha), and transient storage area (A(s)/A). Calibrated values of D ranged from 0.5 m(2) s(-1) to 1.4 m(2) s(-1), A(s)/A ranged from 0.03 to 1.3, and a ranged from 8.7 x 10(-6) s(-1) to 1.0 x 10(-2) s(-1). Observed temporal variability in the in-stream bromide concentration was simulated well. The observed transient storage parameters reflect differences in the structure of the three test reaches. Solute storage in the middle reach was dominated by in-stream storage produced by relict hydraulic structures, while solute transport in the other two reaches reflected differences in bed sediment characteristics between upstream and downstream reaches. However, overparameterization of the model and high sensitivity to the dispersion coefficient made it difficult to assess the magnitude of transient storage or hyporheic exchange.Show less"
45,"Trauth, N",May 2014 ,Hyporheic transport and biogeochemical reactions in pool-riffle systems under varying ambient groundwater flow conditions,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"At the interface between stream water, groundwater, and the hyporheic zone (HZ), important biogeochemical processes that play a crucial role in fluvial ecology occur. Solutes that infiltrate into the HZ can react with each other and possibly also with upwelling solutes from the groundwater. In this study, we systematically evaluate how variations of gaining and losing conditions, stream discharge, and pool-riffle morphology affect aerobic respiration (AR) and denitrification (DN) in the HZ. For this purpose, a computational fluid dynamics model of stream water flow is coupled to a reactive transport model. Scenarios of variations of the solute concentration in the upwelling groundwater were conducted. Our results show that solute influx, residence time, and the size of reactive zones strongly depend on presence, magnitude, and direction of ambient groundwater flow. High magnitudes of ambient groundwater flow lower AR efficiency by up to 4 times and DN by up to 3 orders of magnitude, compared to neutral conditions. The influence of stream discharge and morphology on the efficiency of AR and DN are minor, in comparison to that of ambient groundwater flow. Different scenarios of O2 and NO3 concentrations in the upwelling groundwater reveal that DN efficiency of the HZ is highest under low upwelling magnitudes accompanied with low concentrations of O2 and NO3. Our results demonstrate how ambient groundwater flow influences solute transport, AR, and DN in the HZ. Neglecting groundwater flow in stream-groundwater interactions would lead to a significant overestimation of the efficiency of biogeochemical reactions in fluvial systems.Show less"
46,"Gonzalez-Pinzon, R",Mar 2015 ,A field comparison of multiple techniques to quantify groundwater-surface-water interactions,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Groundwater-surface-water (GW-SW) interactions in streams are difficult to quantify because of heterogeneity in hydraulic and reactive processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The challenge of quantifying these interactions has led to the development of several techniques, from centimeter-scale probes to whole-system tracers, including chemical, thermal, and electrical methods. We co-applied conservative and smart reactive solute-tracer tests, measurement of hydraulic heads, distributed temperature sensing, vertical profiles of solute tracer and temperature in the stream bed, and electrical resistivity imaging in a 450-m reach of a 3(rd)-order stream. GW-SW interactions were not spatially expansive, but were high in flux through a shallow hyporheic zone surrounding the reach. NaCl and resazurin tracers suggested different surface-subsurface exchange patterns in the upper 2/3 and lower 1/3 of the reach. Subsurface sampling of tracers and vertical thermal profiles quantified relatively high fluxes through a 10- to 20-cm deep hyporheic zone with chemical reactivity of the resazurin tracer indicated at 3-, 6-, and 9-cm sampling depths. Monitoring of hydraulic gradients along transects with MINIPOINT streambed samplers starting approximate to 40 m from the stream indicated that groundwater discharge prevented development of a larger hyporheic zone, which progressively decreased from the stream thalweg toward the banks. Distributed temperature sensing did not detect extensive inflow of ground water to the stream, and electrical resistivity imaging showed limited large-scale hyporheic exchange. We recommend choosing technique(s) based on: 1) clear definition of the questions to be addressed (physical, biological, or chemical processes), 2) explicit identification of the spatial and temporal scales to be covered and those required to provide an appropriate context for interpretation, and 3) maximizing generation of mechanistic understanding and reducing costs of implementing multiple techniques through collaborative research.Show less"
47,"Van den Brink, FWB",Feb 2013 ,"Diversity, occurrence and feeding traits of caddisfly larvae as indicators for ecological integrity of river-floodplain habitats along a connectivity gradient",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"In order to assess ecological values of Lower Rhine and Meuse floodplain habitats we studied the spatial and seasonal variation in diversity, species assemblages and feeding traits of caddisfly larvae in water bodies over the lateral connectivity gradient: eupotamon: main and secondary channels: parapotamon: channels connected permanently with the main channel only at their downstream ends; plesiopotamon: disconnected channels close to the main channel; paleopotamon: abandoned meanders at a greater distance from the main channel.Spatial variety was studied by analyzing the summer species composition in 70 Lower Rhine and Meuse water bodies which were categorized in connectivity habitats, whereas seasonal variety was studied in Lower Rhine water bodies along a connectivity gradient by monthly sampling over a whole year. Physico-chemical data and environmental parameters were recorded for each water body during sampling. Diversity and species assemblages of caddisfly larvae varied in relation to connectivity, macrophyte diversity and abundance and stream velocity. A comparison with historical records and species lists from less disturbed rivers showed that diversity in the main channel was very low.Caddisfly larvae species assemblages varied over the connectivity gradient. Lotic habitats (eupotamon) were separated from the lentic ones, and the well vegetated paleopotamon from the sparsely vegetated parapotamon and pleisopotamon habitats, indicating the overall importance of vegetation and current velocity for the species assemblages. Hydropsychidae have been found in the eupotamon exclusively, whereas Limnephilidae, Hydroptilidae and Polycentropodidae have been found predominantly in the paleopotamon water bodies. Leptoceridae were found in all floodplain water body categories. A similar pattern of distribution of families along the lateral connectivity gradient was found in more natural rivers.Caddisfly larvae species feeding traits showed a clear differentiation over the lateral connectivity gradient with filter-feeders and scrapers most important in the eupotamon and parapotamon, and shredders, piercers and predators most dominant in the paleopotamon habitats, indicating the importance of nutritional resources in relation to hydrological connectivity for the structure and functioning of caddisfly larvae species assemblages. The analysis of the species feeding traits allows generalizations towards the entire aquatic community and general prognoses for other floodplain ecosystems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

49,"Gomez-Velez, JD",Dec 2015 ,Denitrification in the Mississippi River network controlled by flow through river bedforms,NATURE GEOSCIENCE,"Increasing nitrogen concentrations in the world's major rivers have led to over-fertilization of sensitive downstream waters(1-4). Flow through channel bed and bank sediments acts to remove riverine nitrogen through microbe-mediated denitrification reactions(5-10). However, little is understood about where in the channel network this biophysical process is most efficient, why certain channels are more effective nitrogen reactors, and how management practices can enhance the removal of nitrogen in regions where water circulates through sediment and mixes with groundwater-hyporheic zones(8,11,12). Here we present numerical simulations of hyporheic flow and denitrification throughout the Mississippi River network using a hydrogeomorphic model. We find that vertical exchange with sediments beneath the riverbed in hyporheic zones, driven by submerged bedforms, has denitrification potential that far exceeds lateral hyporheic exchange with sediments alongside river channels, driven by river bars and meandering banks. We propose that geomorphic differences along river corridors can explain why denitrification efficiency varies between basins in the Mississippi River network. Our findings suggest that promoting the development of permeable bedforms at the streambed-and thus vertical hyporheic exchange-would be more effective at enhancing river denitrification in large river basins than promoting lateral exchange through induced channel meandering.Show less"
