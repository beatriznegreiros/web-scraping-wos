0,"Zheng, Z",Jan 2014 ,A deterministic and Monte Carlo coupling method for PWR cavity radiation streaming calculation,ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY,"PWR cavity radiation streaming calculation is important for the evaluation of the radioactive dose rate in structural materials. Discrete Ordinates (S-N) method has been widely used to solve shielding problems, but it is difficult to apply to a complex geometry. Monte Carlo (MC) method can treat the geometry exactly but requires very long computing time to obtain acceptable statistic deviations. Thus, an S-N-MC coupling method is adopted in order to combine the advantages of both S-N method and MC method in PWR cavity radiation streaming calculations. To develop this coupling method, two surface source models, the combined surface source model (CSSM) and the single surface source model (SSSM), are proposed and analyzed. From the numerical results two conclusions can be drawn. (1) The S-N-MC coupling method offers a speedup factor of 2-20 compared with the MC method to obtain the same statistic deviations. (2) In the S-N-MC coupling method, the CSSM is more efficient than the SSSM in reducing statistic deviations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
1,"Vander Vorste, R",Jan 2017 ,Gammarus pulex (Crustacea: Amphipoda) avoids increasing water temperature and intraspecific competition through vertical migration into the hyporheic zone: a mesocosm experiment,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"The saturated interstices below and adjacent to the riverbed (i.e., the hyporheic zone) can be a refuge for biota during low flows, flow cessation and river drying. Prior to complete drying, organisms are constrained by abiotic and biotic factors (e.g., water temperature, competition) and may respond through vertical migration into the hyporheic zone. However, it remains unclear when temperature and competition become harsh enough to trigger migration. Furthermore, potential consequences of using the hyporheic zone, which is often food-limited, on the survival, effects on ecosystem function and physiology of organisms are unknown. We tested the hypotheses that (1) Gammarus pulex, a widespread detritivore, migrates into the hyporheic zone to avoid increasing surface water temperature and intraspecific competition and (2) that these factors would reduce their survival, leaf mass consumption and energy stores. Using 36 mesocosms, three temperature (15, 20, 25 A degrees C) and species density levels (low, medium, high) were manipulated in a factorial design over 15 days. Increasing temperature to 25 A degrees C and a threefold increase in density both caused G. pulex to vertically migrate, and the interaction of these factors was additive, rather than antagonistic or synergistic. Importantly, survival, leaf consumption and glycogen content were reduced in high temperature and density treatments, suggesting tradeoffs between tolerating harsh surface conditions and limitations of inhabiting the hyporheic zone. Identifying that the hyporheic zone is used by G. pulex to avoid high water temperature and intraspecific competition is a key finding considering the global-scale increases in temperature and flow intermittence.Show less"
2,"Hohensinner, S",Jan 2004 ,Reconstruction of the characteristics of a natural alluvial river-floodplain system and hydromorphological changes following human modifications: The Danube River (1812-1991),RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Based on detailed historical surveys from 1812, the natural riverine landscape of a 10.25-km-long reach of the Danube River in the Austrian Machland region prior to channelization is analysed. Anthropogenically induced changes of fluvial dynamics, hydrological connectivity and aquatic habitat composition are discussed, comparing the situations following channelization (1925) and flow regulation (1991). In 1812 the alluvial river-floodplain system of the Danube River comprised a highly complex channel network, numerous gravel bars and extensive islands, with the main channel and side arms (eupotamon) representing about 97% of the entire water surface at low flow. The floodplain was characterized by relatively flat terrain and numerous natural trenches (former active channels) connected to the main channel. These hydromorphological conditions led to marked expansion/contraction of the water surface area at water level fluctuations below bankfull ('flow pulse'). The high degree of hydrological connectivity enabled intensive exchange processes and favoured migrations of aquatic organisms between the river and floodplain habitats over a period of approximately 90 days per year. Overall in 1812, 57% of the active zone (active channels and floodplain) was inundated at bankfull water level.Channelization and construction of hydropower plants resulted in a truncated fluvial system. Consequently, eupotamal water bodies decreased by 65%, and gravel/sand bars and vegetated islands decreased by 94% and 97%, respectively, whereas the area of the various backwaters doubled. In 1991 the former 'flow pulse' was halved due to artificial levees and embankments, greatly diminishing hydrological connectivity and decoupling large areas of the floodplain from the main channel. Active overflow, formerly playing an important role, is now replaced by backwater flooding and seepage inflow in isolated water bodies. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.Show less"
3,"Kanno, Y",Jan 2014 ,Linking movement and reproductive history of brook trout to assess habitat connectivity in a heterogeneous stream network,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Defining functional connectivity between habitats in spatially heterogeneous landscapes is a particular challenge for small-bodied aquatic species. Traditional approaches (e.g. mark-recapture studies) preclude an assessment of animal movement over the life cycle (birth to reproduction), and movement of individuals may not represent the degree of gene movement for fecund species.2. We investigated the degree of habitat connectivity (defined as the exchange of individuals and genes between mainstem and tributary habitats) in a stream brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) population using mark-recapture [passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags], stationary PIT-tag antennae and genetic pedigree data collected over 4years (3425 marked individuals). We hypothesised that: (i) a combination of these data would reveal higher estimates of animal movement over the life cycle (within a generation), relative to more temporally confined approaches, and (ii) movement estimates of individuals within a generation would differ from between-generation movement of genes because of spatial variation in reproductive success associated with high fecundity of this species.3. Over half of PIT-tagged fish (juveniles and adults) were recaptured within 20m during periodic sampling, indicating restricted movement. However, continuous monitoring with stationary PIT-tag antennae revealed distinct peaks in trout movements in June and October-November, and sibship data inferred post-emergence movements of young-of-year trout that were too small to be tagged physically. A combination of these methods showed that a moderate portion of individuals (28-33%) moved between mainstem and tributary habitats over their life cycle.4. Patterns of reproductive success varied spatially and temporally. The importance of tributaries as spawning habitat was discovered by accounting for reproductive history. When individuals born in the mainstem reproduced successfully, over 50% of their surviving offspring were inferred to have been born in tributaries. This high rate of gene movement to tributaries was cryptic, and it would have been missed by estimates based only on movement of individuals.5. This study highlighted the importance of characterising animal movement over the life cycle for inferring habitat connectivity accurately. Such movements of individuals can contribute to substantial gene movements in a fecund species characterised by high variation in reproductive success.Show less"
4,"Draoui, Y",Jan 2021 ,Quantification of Surface Water-Groundwater Exchanges by GIS Coupled with Experimental Gauging in an Alluvial Environment,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS,"Surface water and groundwater are two interrelated components, where the influence of one automatically affects the quantity and quality of the other. These exchange flows are robustly influenced by some mechanisms such as permeability, lithological nature of the soil, landscape, in addition to the difference between the hydrometric height of the river and the piezometric level of groundwater. The study area of Bou Ahmed plain is vulnerable to intensive pumping mainly in the coastal fringe. The increase in water demand, due to demographic development, is accompanied by pressure on groundwater abstraction which causes significant drops of the groundwater level. The main objectives of this study are to develop Geographic Information System database and mathematical models to analyze spatial and temporal hydrogeological characteristics and hydrodynamic functioning of groundwater flow of the Bou Ahmed aquifer. The present work exhibits the characteristics of the river-groundwater exchanges in an alluvial plain. Therefore, we quantified the flows exchanged between a river and its groundwater using GIS tools along with measurements of parameters obtained by the differential gauging, which was carried out in the field, and hydrogeological boreholes data. These quantified flows, moreover, enabled us to eventually estimate the uncertainties related to the use of the GIS method. These results will also be used to support a set of groundwater simulations based on MODFLOW code in the Bou Ahmad aquifer. These models also associated with develop Geographic Information System will help to better plan, manage and control the groundwater resources of this aquifer.Show less"
5,"Albanese, S",Jun 2013 ,Assessment of the environmental conditions of the Sarno river basin (south Italy): a stream sediment approach,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH,"The Sarno river basin covers an area of 500 km(2) collecting the waters of Solofrana and Cavaiola tributaries. Originally it manly represents a source of livelihood for inhabitants by fishing and transporting goods; currently, the Sarno river, still partially used for irrigation, is affected by an extreme environmental degradation as a result of uncontrolled outflow of industrial waste. Within the framework of a wider geochemical prospecting project aiming at characterizing the whole territory of the Campania region, 89 stream sediment samples with a sampling density of 1 sample per 5 km(2) were collected in the river basin and analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in order to assess the environmental conditions at a regional scale. A GIS-aided technique, based on both the actual distribution of potentially harmful elements and their regional background values, was used to generate the maps of the contamination factors and of the contamination degrees for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn. Furthermore, a factor analysis was performed to assess the nature and the extent of contamination sources for the river sediments. Results showed that the Sarno river basin could be divided in two ""environmental status"" units: one, low contaminated, corresponding to the hilly and mountain areas, and the second, from moderately to very highly contaminated, corresponding to the economically developed areas of the valley floor characterized by a high population density. This work was developed within a project that aims to investigate the relationships between environmental pollution and human health by analyzing environmental media (stream sediments, water, soil and vegetation) together with human hair of resident population. In this context, the spatial correlation between the extremely compromised environmental conditions of developed areas and the incidence rate of liver cancer in the same area was also explored posing the need of a careful costs/benefits analysis to assess whether the deterioration of the environment, that could adversely affect the conditions of public health, is worth the economic development.Show less"
6,"Welsh, MK",Jan 3 2020 ,Stream and floodplain restoration impacts riparian zone hydrology of agricultural streams,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"While the influence of stream restoration on vertical and lateral hyporheic exchange has been documented, impacts on broader riparian zone hydrology have not been thoroughly investigated. We quantified riparian water table dynamics, hydraulic gradient, and groundwater flow paths and fluxes across a range of hydrologic conditions following natural channel design restoration (riparian regrading, in-channel cross-vane structure installation). Water table measurements were collected at least once per season for 2.5 years to capture water levels during baseflow conditions from networks of wells and piezometers at sites with different stream morphology (created riffle-cross-vane-scour pool complexes versus natural pools and riffles), restoration status (agricultural restored, unrestored, forested reference), and riparian characteristics (slope, soils, topography) in North Carolina, USA. The regraded riparian zone had higher near-stream water tables (< 0.5 m below ground surface) than the unrestored site. Riffle-cross-vane complexes induced a zone of low hydraulic gradient that spanned 30-40% of the riparian area, similar to groundwater dynamics near beaver dams. This effect persisted regardless of hydrologic condition (wet or dry) or scour pool status (functioning or filled-in). Riffles also promoted a lower near-stream hydraulic gradient at the forested site. Conversely, the influence of stream features on riparian groundwater was minimal at the unrestored site, where groundwater fluxes were controlled by hillslope inputs and riparian geomorphology. Overall, restoration enhanced stream-riparian zone hydrologic interaction beyond the immediate hyporheic zone. Our work stresses that cross-vanes, even when partially buried by sediments post-restoration, impact whole floodplain hydrology in a more significant way than shown by prior stream restoration studies.Show less"
7,"Zhang, JH",Nov 2019 ,"Water-Exchange Response of Downstream River-Lake System to the Flow Regulation of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China",WATER,"Hydrological regime changes in the river-lake system and their influences on the ecological environment downstream dams have attracted increasingly more attention all over the world. The Dongting lake downstream of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in the Yangtze River has been experiencing a series of hydraulic and hydrological changes over the last decade. The hydrological and ecological influences of the TGD flow regulation on the Dongting river-lake system and its functional mechanism during the impounding periods remain extremely unclear. This study examines the hydrological changes in the Dongting river-lake system based on a 1D/2D coupled hydrodynamic model. In particular, the inflow boundary of the model with and without the TGD was applied with the outflow and inflow of the TGD, respectively, during the same regulation periods. The results show that the diverted flow from the Yangtze River into the Dongting lake and outflow from the lake back to the river drastically decreased during the impounding periods, especially in October. The decreased water exchange between the Yangtze River and the Dongting lake impaired the water residence capacity to some extent in the lake. Stage decrease in the lake area resulted in a significant reduction in the water volume of the Dongting lake with the same time percentage. In addition, the obvious drainage effect in Dongting lake due to the increased stage difference and current speed after the TGD operation was the essential cause of hydrological changes in the lake area. These results provide an improvement in the understanding of impoundment influences on the large river-lake system and give some practical information for ecological environment management in similar river-lake systems.Show less"
8,"Choi, S",Sep 2017 ,A comprehensive index for stream depletion in coupled human-water systems,JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH,"Intensive land use and land cover (LULC) change along with the gradually increasing effects of climate change have made streams both hydrologically and ecologically vulnerable to depletion. Since stream depletion has a direct impact on human and ecological water use with socioeconomic and ecological consequences, it is imperative to manage streams to keep them in a healthy state. In this study, we developed a stream depletion potential index (SDPI) based on the concept of a coupled human-water system (CHWS) operating at simultaneous, interacting scales, and we tested its applicability to watersheds across South Korea. Eight indicators -precipitation, dry days, effective basin area, stream water usage, return flow, groundwater usage, impervious area, and environmental flow supplied by dams -were identified as the key variables for the SDPI. We adopted the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to estimate the weights of the identified indicators based on their causal relationships. Furthermore, we applied three different weighting schemes for urban, rural, and intermediate areas to make the index more effective and applicable to watershed LULC. The spatial distribution of the SDPI results indicated that the western Han River, the central and southern Nak-Dong River and some parts of the southwestern region of the Korean peninsula are prone to stream depletion from several different causes. The SDPI, by predicting changing streamfiow characteristics, can be used by policy makers and stakeholders to determine a safe yield for both human and environmental stream use without causing a long-term decline of water availability.

9,"Bolland, JD",Oct 2012 ,THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIABLE LATERAL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL FLOODPLAIN WATERBODIES AND RIVER CHANNELS,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The rehabilitation of lowland rivers subjected to channelization and artificial levee construction should attempt to improve habitat heterogeneity and diversity of floodplain hydrological connectivity. However, rehabilitation efforts rarely consider the importance of variable lateral hydrological connectivity between floodplain waterbodies and main river channels (ranging from those permanently connected to those temporarily connected during river level rises), instead focusing on increasing individual floodplain waterbody connectivity. This study investigated the young-of-the-year (YoY) fish communities in 10 artificial floodplain waterbodies of variable hydrological connectivity with the river Trent, England, between May and November 2006, inclusive. Floodplain waterbody connectivity to the main river was positively correlated with the number of species captured (alpha diversity), ShannonWiener diversity, Margalef's species richness index and the relative abundance of rheophilic species and negatively correlated with species turnover (beta diversity). YoY fish communities in poorly connected water bodies were most dissimilar to riverine communities. The results demonstrate the importance of variable lateral connectivity between artificial floodplain waterbodies and main river channels when rehabilitating lowland river fish communities.

10,"Farah-Perez, A",Oct 2020 ,An analysis of river fragmentation by dams and river dewatering in Costa Rica,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Hydropower development is accelerating in the tropics, especially construction of small dams. Small dams are often classified as those lower than 15 m in height or with reservoir capacity less than 3 x 10(6) m(3). Small dams frequently operate with water diversions from the main river channel, thereby affecting river connectivity through the creation of a dewatered reach. However, the extent and impact of dewatered reaches have been overlooked in most analyses of river fragmentation and dams to date. In Costa Rica, small dam development increased during the 1990s, ahead of current trends in other tropical regions. This study examined the effects of dams and their dewatered reaches on river connectivity at a national scale in Costa Rica. We adapted the Dendritic Connectivity Index and applied it to the four basins where over 80% of hydropower development has occurred. Our results showed that in two basins, the Sarapiqui and San Carlos, dewatered reaches contributed most to river fragmentation. In the Tarcoles and Reventazon basins, dams and dewatered reaches had similar effects on river fragmetnation. These different patterns can be explained by the spatial arrangement of dams in the individual river networks. We also found that dewatered reaches extended the elevation range of rivers affected by hydropower activity; this expansion was most significant in cases with interbasin water transfers. We discuss the implications of our findings on connectivity losses from dams for fishes whose range overlaps with hydropower activity. Our study may provide insights for other tropical countries with ongoing and future small dam development.Show less"
11,"Marzadri, A",Aug 16 2014 ,A hydrologic model demonstrates nitrous oxide emissions depend on streambed morphology,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Rivers are hot spots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to denitrification. Although the key role of rivers in transforming reactive inorganic nitrogen is widely recognized, the recent estimates of N2O emissions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) may be largely underestimated. This denotes a lack of reliable and robust methodologies to upscale denitrification, and other biogeochemical processes, from the local to the network scale. Here we demonstrate that stream hydromorphology strongly influences N2O emissions. We provide an integrative methodology for upscaling local biogeochemical processes to the catchment scale with a Damkohler number, which accounts for the complex interplay between stream hydromorphology and biogeochemical characteristics of streambed sediments. Application of this theoretical framework to the large data set collected as part of the second Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINXII) demonstrates that stream morphology is a key factor controlling emissions of N2O from streams.Show less"

Our study objective was to compare stream-air temperature and energy exchange relationships across various stream-ground water relationships in a carbonate watershed. It was hypothesized that ground water-fed stream segments could be distinguished from perched/losing segments using stream-air temperature relationships. Two types of computations were conducted: (1) comparisons of stream-air temperature relationships for the period of October 1999-September 2002 at 12 sites in the Spring Creek drainage and (2) detailed energy budget computations for the same period for ground water-dominated Thompson Run and Lower Buffalo Run, a stream with negligible ground water inputs. Weekly average air temperatures and stream temperatures were highly correlated, but slopes and intercepts of the relationship varied for the 12 sites. Slopes ranged from 0.19 to 0.67 and intercepts ranged from 3.23 to 9.07 degrees C. A two-component mixing model with end members of ground water and actual stream temperatures indicated that the slope and intercept of the stream-air temperature relationship was controlled by ground water inputs. Streams with large ground water inputs had greater intercepts and lesser slopes than streams that were seasonally losing, perched, and/or distant from ground water inputs. Energy fluxes across the air-water interface were greatest for the ground water-fed stream due to increased longwave, latent, and sensible heat losses from the stream in winter when large temperature and vapor pressure differences existed between the stream and air. Advection of ground water was an important source and sink for heat in the ground water-fed stream, depending on season. In contrast, along the seasonally losing stream reach, advection was of minimal importance and stream temperatures were dominated by energy exchange across the air-water interface. Overall, results showed that stream temperatures and energy exchange in this carbonate watershed were strongly related to stream-ground water interactions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

14,"Germain, D",Dec 15 2020 ,"Multidisciplinary approach to sediment connectivity between debris-flow channel network and the Dolra River, Mazeri Valley, Southern Caucasus, Georgia",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"The Mazeri Valley in the southern Caucasus Mountains, Georgia, is characterized by a highly dynamic landscape with several active mass-wasting processes. The spatial and temporal dynamics of these geomorphic processes have, over time, resulted in the formation of large cones and fans. In this context, the coupling between the hill -slope and the channel plays a fundamental role in controlling the catchment sediment dynamics. The sediment produced at higher altitudes on hillslopes may occasionally reach the debris-flow channel network, and downstream propagation may have significant effects on the fluvial environment and create potential hazards for the population and infrastructure. In this regard, we report a tree-ring-based chronology of the debris-flow activity on a large cone to shed light on sediment connectivity and better understand the coupling between the main debris-flow channel and a bedload river in this remote area under global climate change and glacial retreat. The 161 sampled trees demonstrated the appearance of 12 significant events over the last 65 years, with all of the events involving possible sediment input into the stream system of the Dolra River. These successional events, with a return interval of 5.4 years, have partially destabilized the fluvial system and locally induced a switch in the channel style to a braided channel. Surficial sedimentary characteristics, such as morphometric indices, have enabled the discrimination between sediments from the debris-flow activity and river dynamics (alluvium inputs). Finally, most of the reconstructed event-years are characterized by at least one month of above-average rainfall. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
15,"Caldas, B",Jan 2023 ,Identifying the current and future status of freshwater connectivity corridors in the Amazon Basin,CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE,"The Amazon Basin features a vast network of healthy, free-flowing rivers, which provides habitat for the most biodiverse freshwater fauna of any basin globally. However, existing and future infrastructure developments, including dams, threaten its integrity by diminishing river connectivity, altering flows, or changing sediment regimes, which can impact freshwater species. In this study, we assess critical rivers that need to be maintained as freshwater connectivity corridors (FCCs) for selective freshwater species-long-distance migratory fishes and turtles (both with migrations > 500 km) and river dolphins. We define FCCs as river stretches of uninterrupted river connectivity that provide important riverine and floodplain habitat for long-distance migratory and other species and that maintain associated ecosystem functions. We assessed more than 340,000 km of river, beginning with an assessment of the connectivity status of all rivers and then combining river status with models of occurrence of key species to map where FCCs occur and how they could be affected under a scenario of proposed dams. We identified that in 2019, 16 of 26 very long (> 1000 km) rivers are free-flowing but only 9 would remain free-flowing if all proposed dams are built. Among long and very long rivers (> 500 km), 93 are considered FCCs. Under the future scenario, one-fifth (18) of these long and very long FCCs-those that are of critical importance for long-distance migrants and dolphins-would lose their FCC status, including the Amazon, the Negro, Maranon, Napo, Ucayali, Preto do Igapo Acu, Beni, and Uraricoera rivers. To avoid impacts of poorly sited infrastructure, we advocate for energy and water resources planning at the basin scale that evaluates alternative development options and limits development that will impact on FCCs. The results also highlight where corridors could be designated as protected from future fragmentation.Show less"
16,"Villa, JA",May 1 2020 ,Methane and nitrous oxide porewater concentrations and surface fluxes of a regulated river,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rivers are a critical missing component of current global GHG models. Their exclusion is mainly due to a lack of in-situ measurements and a poor understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of GHG production and emissions, which prevents optimal model parametrization. We combined simultaneous observations of porewater concentrations along different beach positions and depths, and surface fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide at a plot scale in a large regulated river during three water stages: rising, falling, and low. Our goal was to gain insights into the interactions between hydrological exchanges and GHG emissions and elucidate possible hypotheses that could guide future research on the mechanisms of GHG production, consumption, and transport in the hyporheic zone (HZ). Results indicate that the site functioned as a net source of methane. Surface fluxes of methane during river water stages at three beach positions (shallow, intermediate and deep) correlated with porewater concentrations of methane. However, fluxes were significantly higher in the intermediate position during the low water stage, suggesting that low residence time increased methane emissions. Vertical profiles of methane peaked at different depths, indicating an influence of the magnitude and direction of the hyporheic mixing during the different river water stages on methane production and consumption. The site acted as either a sink or a source of nitrous oxide depending on the elevation of the water column. Nitrous oxide porewater concentrations peaked at the upper layers of the sediment throughout the different water stages. River hydrological stages significantly influenced porewater concentrations and fluxes of GHG, probably by influencing heterotrophic respiration (production and consumption processes) and transport to and from the HZ. Our results highlight the importance of including dynamic hydrological exchanges when studying and modeling GHG production and consumption in the HZ of large rivers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Through the survey and statistics of 11 provinces (municipalities directly under the Central Government) in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the mechanism of economic-ecological environment coupling coordination degree is defined, and the evaluation index system is constructed based on the scientific and typical characteristics of the Yangtze River region through comprehensive expert suggestions. To ensure the objectivity and accuracy of the evaluation results, based on the scores of ecological environment and economic development, we construct the Yangtze River Economic Belt regional economy-ecological environment coupling coordination model, use the indicators to calculate the economic-ecological environment coupling degree, and analyze the Yangtze River Economic Belt Economic-ecological coupling and coordination degree. The results of the study show that due to the influence of regions and comprehensive economic capabilities, the eastern provinces and cities in the coastal cities of the Yangtze River Economic Belt have the highest degree of coupling and coordination, and the western provinces and cities have the lowest degree of coupling and coordination. After comprehensive analysis, it is found that only sustainable development of ecological environment protection and long-term economic development can continuously optimize the Yangtze River Economic Belt.Show less"
18,"Ferreira, V",,Ecosystem services provided by small streams: an overview,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Small streams constitute the majority of the water courses in a catchment and have specific characteristics that distinguish them from larger streams and rivers. Despite their small size and frequently remote locations, small streams contribute to ecosystem services that are important for humans. Here, we have identified 27 ecosystem services that small streams provide: seven supporting services, eight regulating services, five provisioning services and seven cultural services. Small streams are especially important for the maintenance of biodiversity, which is the basis of many ecosystem services. Small streams also support ecosystem services provided by larger streams and rivers due to longitudinal connectivity resulting in the downstream transference of energy, water, sediments, nutrients, organic matter and organisms. Small streams are, however, highly vulnerable to disturbances, which can compromise the ecosystem services they supply. We see a global need to effectively protect small streams to safeguard biodiversity and human wellbeing.Show less"
19,"Grant, EHC",Jun 2009 ,Salamander occupancy in headwater stream networks,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Stream ecosystems exhibit a highly consistent dendritic geometry in which linear habitat units intersect to create a hierarchical network of connected branches.2. Ecological and life history traits of species living in streams, such as the potential for overland movement, may interact with this architecture to shape patterns of occupancy and response to disturbance. Specifically, large-scale habitat alteration that fragments stream networks and reduces connectivity may reduce the probability a stream is occupied by sensitive species, such as stream salamanders.3. We collected habitat occupancy data on four species of stream salamanders in first-order (i.e. headwater) streams in undeveloped and urbanised regions of the eastern U.S.A. We then used an information-theoretic approach to test alternative models of salamander occupancy based on a priori predictions of the effects of network configuration, region and salamander life history.4. Across all four species, we found that streams connected to other first-order streams had higher occupancy than those flowing directly into larger streams and rivers. For three of the four species, occupancy was lower in the urbanised region than in the undeveloped region.5. These results demonstrate that the spatial configuration of stream networks within protected areas affects the occurrences of stream salamander species. We strongly encourage preservation of network connections between first-order streams in conservation planning and management decisions that may affect stream species.Show less"

Finally, nontrivial simulations and experiments are worked out to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical methods.Show less"
21,"Casanova, SMC",Dec 2009 ,"Rotifer abundance, biomass, and secondary production after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity between a river and two marginal lakes (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",LIMNOLOGICA,"Rotifera density, biomass, and secondary production on two marginal lakes of Paranapanema River were compared after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity with the river (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality. Stable conditions, caused by low connectivity in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were associated to elevated richness and diversity values, caused by exchange biota due to higher connectivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

22,"Welsh, MK",2020 ,IMPACT OF RIPARIAN AND STREAM RESTORATION ON DENITRIFICATION IN GEOMORPHIC FEATURES OF AGRICULTURAL STREAMS,TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE,"Agricultural land use, channel modifications, and riparian vegetation composition can affect instream denitrification by altering geomorphic features, such as sediment texture, organic matter, retention time, and hyporheic exchange. Stream and riparian restoration is widely implemented in agricultural watersheds to mitigate excess nutrient export to sensitive downstream waters; however, the cumulative impact of channel reconstruction and altered channel and near-stream morphology on nitrogen dynamics remains poorly understood. We measured denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) and environmental variables (e.g., water chemistry, sediment texture, and organic matter) in different geomorphic features in agriculturally influenced streams in North Carolina with varied channel and riparian zone characteristics. Our results indicate that denitrification is primarily influenced by increased transport of nitrate (NO3-) to the streams in wetter months. Secondarily, structural factors, including riparian vegetation and stream geomorphology, impact denitrification by controlling the distribution of sediment texture and organic carbon. In the newly restored stream, we observed coarser streambed sediments and low sediment organic carbon, especially in scour pools constructed downstream from cross-vanes. Lower DEA was observed in restored pools (39.1 ng N g(-1) dry mass h(-1)) compared to naturally occurring pools (70.7 to 278.1 ng N g(-1) dry mass h(-1)). These results highlight the need for restoration strategies to be directed at increasing organic carbon and residence times through complex flowpaths (e.g., meanders, root wads, artificial woody debris dams).Show less"
23,"Falke, JA",Mar 2006 ,Effects of reservoir connectivity on stream fish assemblages in the Great Plains,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"The upstream effects of reservoirs on stream fish assemblages were highly localized in 3rd- through 5th- order streams in the Great Plains, USA. Streams that differed in connectivity to reservoirs were sampled at their confluences with a river or reservoir and between the confluence and the stream's origin. Sites at confluences had higher total, normative, and reservoir species richness than middle sites. Variability in fish assemblage structure upstream of reservoirs was influenced by catchment area, stream size, gradient, and reservoir connectivity. Confluence sites connected to reservoirs were correctly classified based on the presence of red. shiners (Cyprinella lutrensis) and bluntnose minnows (Pimephales notatus) and the absence of sand shiners (Notropis stramineus); middle sites on connected streams were classified by the absence of redfin shiners (Lythrurus umbratilis). Intensive sampling across pool habitats within two streams isolated by a reservoir indicated that abundance of common reservoir species was related to pool size, turbidity, and canopy cover, but not proximity to the reservoir. These data suggest that streams connected to reservoirs can maintain diverse native fish communities with minimal invasions by reservoir-dwelling species, but a fraction of the community either has been lost or occurs at low abundance (e.g., sand shiners and redfin shiners).Show less"
24,"Rolls, RJ",Dec 1 2018 ,Simultaneous assessment of two passage facilities for maintaining hydrological connectivity for subtropical coastal riverine fish,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Engineering solutions that aim to restore hydrological connectivity in river systems fragmented by dams and weirs frequently include the installation of fish passage facilities (i.e. fishways). Assessment of fish passage performance is often limited to single fishway designs and with a focus on species of commercial or conservation significance, meaning that conclusions regarding fishway success may not apply to all species that require access to fragmented habitats. We simultaneously compared the population structure and fish assemblage composition at two fishways (vertical slot and fish lock designs) at weirs in a subtropical coastal river system. We used hydrological and physico-chemical water quality data to explore if fishway performance was linked to particular environmental conditions. At both fishways, fish assemblage composition differed between fishway exit and downstream river samples, yet differences between exit and river samples were not associated with hydrological variables related to the size and frequency of weir drown-out events or water quality. Population structure of the most abundant species (sea mullet, Mugil cephalus; 61% of fish samples) also differed significantly among fishway exit and river habitats. A low-level structure spanning the river channel downstream of one weir was not associated with differences in fish assemblage composition indicating that access to the fishway entrance (and therefore fishway use) was not hindered by in-stream obstructions. Eight and seven species (predominantly small-bodied species that migrate within freshwater systems) were exclusively sampled in downstream river locations at the vertical slot and fish lock fishways, respectively, indicating that neither design was fully capable of facilitating the passage of the local fish fauna. Further assessment over a broader range of hydrological conditions will be necessary to determine if use of either fishway by fish is affected by low flows. Coupled with evidence produced from landscape-scale analysis of spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage structure and dispersal patterns of diadromous species associated with river flow regime highlight that hydrological connectivity may be maintained by natural weir drown-out events. This study highlights that factors controlling hydrological connectivity for riverine biota need to be integrated among co-occurring anthropogenic impacts to identify and overcome constraints to effective conservation management in rivers subject to water resource development.Show less"

It is needed to develop sound plans for sustainable use of the groundwater with minimal undesirable effects. This article reports an investigation of the component (module) that describes the stream-aquifer flow exchange in several groundwater simulators. The study indicates that the module may not have a solid physical basis when used in large-scale regional studies to estimate the stream-aquifer flow exchange. The component relies upon an empirical parameter known as the leakance coefficient. It is demonstrated that neglecting river penetration of the aquifer can lead to non-negligible errors in estimation of seepage. In addition the leakance coefficient (dimension inverse of a time) is not constant in time but varies with the conditions in the river and in the surrounding aquifer. A potential, practical and simple alternative is presented.Show less"
27,"Li, YQ",Oct 2021 ,Resolving the origins of invertebrate colonists in the Yangtze River Estuary with molecular markers: Implications for ecological connectivity,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Understanding connectivity over different spatial and temporal scales is fundamental for managing of ecological systems. However, controversy exists for wintertime ecological connectivity between the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) and inner southwestern Yellow Sea. Here, we investigated ecological connectivity between the YRE and inner southwestern Yellow Sea in wintertime by precisely pinpointing the source of the newly colonized populations of a winter-spawning rocky intertidal invertebrate, Littorina brevicula (Philippi, 1844), on artificial structures along the coast of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) using mitochondrial ND6 sequences and microsatellite data. Clear phylogeographic and genetic differentiation were detected between natural rocky populations south and north of the YRE, which resulted from the lack of hard substrate for rocky invertebrates in the large YRD coast. For the newly colonized populations on the coast of YRD, most individuals (98%) to the south of similar to 33.5 degrees N were from natural rocky populations to the south of the YRE and most of those (94%) to the north of similar to 33.5 degrees N were from the northern natural rocky populations, which demonstrated strong ecological connectivity between the inner southwestern Yellow Sea and the YRE in winter time. We presented the first genetic evidence that demonstrated a northward wintertime coastal current in the inner southwestern Yellow Sea, and precisely illustrated the boundary of the coastal current recently proposed by numerical experiment. These results indicated that the YRE serves as an important source of materials and energy for the inner southwestern Yellow Sea in winter, which can be crucial for the function of the Yellow Sea ecosystem.Show less"

Within the context of a case study, this paper presents the results from a number of common data collection techniques ranging from point to reach scales used in combination to better understand the spatial complexity of subsurface exchanges, infer the hydrologic conditions where individual influences of hyporheic and groundwater exchange components on stream water can be characterized, and determine where gaps in information arise. We start with a tracer-based, longitudinal channel water balance to quantify hydrologic gains and losses at a sub-reach scale nested within two consecutive reaches. Next, we look at groundwater and stream water surface levels, shallow streambed vertical head gradients, streambed and aquifer hydraulic conductivities, water chemistry, and vertical flux rates estimated from streambed temperatures to provide more spatially explicit information. As a result, a clearer spatial understanding of gains and losses was provided, but some limitations in interpreting results were identified even when combining information collected over various scales. Due to spatial variability of exchanges and areas of mixing, each technique frequently captured a combination of groundwater and hyporheic exchange components. Ultimately, this study provides information regarding technique selection, emphasizes that care must be taken when interpreting results, and identifies the need to apply or develop more advanced methods for understanding subsurface exchanges.

30,"Chaput-Bardy, A",Jun 2017 ,Network analysis for species management in rivers networks: Application to the Loire River,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,"Forecasting the colonization process is important for wildlife managers who supervise the reintroduction of endangered species or control the spread of invasive species. Patch connectivity is thus critical to predicting the fates of expanding populations. Connectivity in river networks results from river dendritic structure and dispersal modality of organisms. Both factors may strongly affect the colonization process and the efficiency of conservation action plans. Based on empirical data, we simulated, using a simplified model with limited number of parameters, the colonization of a large river network, the Loire River, by the native Eurasian beaver and the invasive African clawed frog. For each species, we inferred model parameters (dispersal behavior and distances) by comparing the simulated and the observed distributions. Using network theory, we evaluated the efficiency of alternative conservation strategies to prevent or promote colonization of the river network. Network robustness to fragmentation and disturbance was also assessed. The model acdurately predicted > 70% of the observed species ranges. Conservation strategies that selectively protect habitat patches with the highest connectivity values provide a weak advantage at preventing connectivity loss compared to random protection strategies. In contrast, the targeted destruction of highly connected patches had a much stronger effect on the fragmentation of the network than the random removal of habitat patches. Spatial network topology strongly contributes to determining colonization patterns of large river watersheds. Network theory allows tests for robustness of rivers to fragmentation and disturbance, and identification of strategies for conservation planning.Show less"
31,"Delfs, JO",Sep 2009 ,A physically based model concept for transport modelling in coupled hydrosystems,GRUNDWASSER,"Hydrosystems are very complex systems with numerous processes occuring simultaneously at different spatial and temporal scales. In this paper we present the concept of a compartment approach for the analysis of coupled hydrosystems including heat and mass transport. In this concept, flow and transport processes are coupled via their compartment (or process domain) boundaries without giving up the computational necessities and optimisations for the numerical solution of each individual process. In this new approach, random walk particle tracking (RWPT) methods are integrated into the coupled hydrosystem analysis. We briefly introduce the RWPT method and the governing equations for water flow, heat, and mass transport in aquifers, soils and on surfaces. Flow processes are described by diffusion equations (Darcy equation for groundwater flow, Richards equation for flow in the unsaturated zone, and the diffusive wave approximation for overland flow) which are coupled by exchange fluxes. Transport processes are described by advection-diffusion equations and coupled with the exchange fluxes by advection. We present three application examples concerning flow, mass and heat transport in coupled hydrosystems based on Horton- and Dunne overland flow as well as on hyporheic flows.Show less"

33,"Demars, BOL",Mar 2005 ,"Distribution of aquatic vascular plants in lowland rivers: separating the effects of local environmental conditions, longitudinal connectivity and river basin isolation",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Changes in species distributions along rivers have rarely been observed independently of changes in environmental conditions and meaningful comparison between different catchments is made difficult by the limited geographical distribution of species. This study presents a new approach to quantify the effect of the spatial structure of lowland river networks on aquatic plant distribution and to explore the potential underlying processes using species life-history characteristics.2. Twenty-five species of aquatic vascular plants recorded in 62 sites across five calcareous river basins were used to investigate (i) the temporal turnover of plant species, (ii) the habitat utilisation of species, (iii) the trade-offs between different plant life-history characteristics and (iv) the relationship between species life-history characteristics and habitat utilisation.3. The annual plant turnover within a 3-year period was, although significant, extremely low. It suggests that results from spatial surveys conducted over 3 years should not be undermined by temporal changes.4. Spatial connectivity along and between rivers was more important than in-channel physical characteristics in shaping species assemblages. Neither chemical factors (ammonium, phosphate) nor extrinsic biotic competitors (filamentous green algae) significantly influenced plant distribution.5. The most common combinations of life-history characteristics were neither related to environmental conditions nor to spatial isolation. Instead, they could reflect natural selection processes associated with larger scales than those considered in this study.6. Plant distribution was most strongly related to the dispersal and regeneration abilities of the plants, supporting the hypotheses relating to longitudinal connectivity. The hypothesis that different growth forms would be associated with different in-channel physical features was not verified. As expected, there were no substantial differences in plant life-history characteristics between river basins.Show less"

Yet the impact of restoration on diatom assemblages and algal biomass in a stream is rarely addressed in the scientific literature reporting the outcomes of restoration projects aimed at improving riverine habitat. To investigate the potential for using benthic diatoms as indicators of the benefits to habitat associated with river restoration, we conducted a pilot diatom study in Whychus Creek, a headwater tributary of the Deschutes River in Oregon, USA. As part of a work study project for college students, we collected periphyton samples in a restored reach, a restored transition reach and an unrestored reach (control) and compared diatom assemblages and algae biomass of these reaches. Diatom assemblages and traits differed substantially between the control and restored reaches and the median percentage of chlorophyllain the periphyton biomass increased from 9% in the control reach to 12% in the restored reach. The results of this pilot study suggest that benthic diatom assemblage may be useful indicators of river restoration success, particularly for approaches that aim to reconfigure channels and increase floodplain connectivity and habitat complexity.Show less"

Traditionally, LW has been removed from streams to minimize localized flooding and increase conveyance efficiency. More recently, LW is often added to streams as a component of stream and river restoration activities. While much research has focused on the role of LW in habitat provisioning, geomorphic stability, and hydraulics at low to medium flows, we know little about the role of LW during storm events. To address this question, we investigated the role of LW on floodplain connectivity along a headwater stream in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Specifically, we conducted two artificial floods, one with and one without LW, and then utilized field measurements in conjunction with hydrodynamic modeling to quantify floodplain connectivity during the experimental floods and to characterize potential management variables for optimized restoration activities. Experimental observations show that the addition of LW increased maximum floodplain inundation extent by 34%, increased floodplain inundation depth by 33%, and decreased maximum thalweg velocity by 10%. Model results demonstrated that different placement of LW along the reach has the potential to increase floodplain flow by up to 40%, with highest flooding potential at cross sections with high longitudinal velocity and shallow depth. Additionally, model simulations show that the effects of LW on floodplain discharge decrease as storm recurrence interval increases, with no measurable impact at a recurrence interval of more than 25 years.Show less"
37,"Xin, ZH",May 10 2013 ,Analysis of stream temperature and heat budget in an urban river under strong anthropogenic influences,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Stream temperature variations of the Tama River, which runs through highly urbanized areas of Tokyo, were studied in relation to anthropogenic impacts, including wastewater effluents, dam release and water withdrawal. Both long-term and longitudinal changes in stream temperature were identified and the influences of stream flow rate, temperature and volume of wastewater effluents and air temperature were investigated. Water and heat budget analyses were also conducted for several segments of the mainstream to clarify the relative impacts from natural and anthropogenic factors. Stream temperatures in the winter season significantly increased over the past 20 years at sites affected by intensive and warm effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located along the mainstream. In the summer season, a larger stream temperature increase was identified in the upstream reaches, which was attributable to the decreased flow rate due to water withdrawal. The relationship between air and stream temperatures indicated that stream temperatures at the upstream site were likely to be affected by a dam release, while temperatures in the downstream reaches have deviated more from air temperatures in recent years, probably due to the increased impacts of effluents from WWTPs. Results of the water and heat budget analyses indicated that the largest contributions to water and heat gains were attributable to wastewater effluents, while other factors such as groundwater recharge and water withdrawal were found to behave as energy sinks, especially in summer. The inflow from tributaries worked to reduce the impacts of dam release and the heat exchanges at the air-water interface contributed less to heat budgets in both winter and summer seasons for all river segments.

38,"Mahlum, S",Dec 2014 ,Assessing the biological relevance of aquatic connectivity to stream fish communities,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Recent advances in the ability to quantify longitudinal connectivity of riverine systems is enabling a better understanding of how connectivity affects fish assemblages. However, the role of connectivity relative to other factors, such as land use, in structuring biological assemblages is just emerging. We assessed the relevance of a structural connectivity index to stream fish communities at a relatively large scale (across five watersheds of Lake Ontario) while controlling for confounding habitat variables, such as land use, elevation, and stream topology. The results were assessed to determine whether species' sensitivities to connectivity are in accordance with expectations of life history. Our results indicated that at large scales, structural connectivity explains significant amounts of variation in community structure (1% to 5.4% as measured by Bray-Curtis similarity), but remains secondary to other habitat components. Connectivity also was significantly related to abundance in three of the seven species assessed. The lower explanatory power of our models compared with studies done at smaller scales suggests that the relevance of connectivity to fish communities is scale-dependent and diminishes relative to other environmental factors at larger spatial extents.Show less"
39,"Gardner, C",Jan 2013 ,DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF STREAM FISHES IN RELATION TO BARRIERS: IMPLICATIONS FOR MONITORING STREAM RECOVERY AFTER BARRIER REMOVAL,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Dams are ubiquitous in coastal regions and have altered stream habitats and the distribution and abundance of stream fishes in those habitats by disrupting hydrology, temperature regime and habitat connectivity. Dam removal is a common restoration tool, but often the response of the fish assemblage is not monitored rigorously. Sedgeunkedunk Stream, a small tributary to the Penobscot River (Maine, USA), has been the focus of a restoration effort that includes the removal of two low-head dams. In this study, we quantified fish assemblage metrics along a longitudinal gradient in Sedgeunkedunk Stream and also in a nearby reference stream. By establishing pre-removal baseline conditions and associated variability and the conditions and variability immediately following removal, we can characterize future changes in the system associated with dam removal. Over 2?years prior to dam removal, species richness and abundance in Sedgeunkedunk Stream were highest downstream of the lowest dam, lowest immediately upstream of that dam and intermediate farther upstream; patterns were similar in the reference stream. Although seasonal and annual variation in metrics within each site was substantial, the overall upstream-to-downstream pattern along the stream gradient was remarkably consistent prior to dam removal. Immediately after dam removal, we saw significant decreases in richness and abundance downstream of the former dam site and a corresponding increase in fish abundance upstream of the former dam site. No such changes occurred in reference sites. Our results show that by quantifying baseline conditions in a small stream before restoration, the effects of stream restoration efforts on fish assemblages can be monitored successfully. These data set the stage for the long-term assessment of Sedgeunkedunk Stream and provide a simple methodology for assessment in other restoration projects.

41,"Cook, PG",Dec 15 2013 ,Estimating groundwater discharge to rivers from river chemistry surveys,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Environmental tracer methods have been used to quantify groundwater discharge to rivers for the past few decades. A number of different tracers have been used in these studies, including individual ion concentrations, electrical conductivity, stable isotopes H-2 and O-18, and the dissolved gases helium, chlorofluorocarbons and radon. This paper discusses the assumptions of the method, as well as its resolution and accuracy. The method will be most accurate when the tracer concentration in groundwater is very distinct from that in the river. On the basis of typical parameters, groundwater inflow rates as low as 5mm/day can usually be estimated with electrical conductivity and ion tracers. A lower limit of resolution of approximately 2mm/day is usually possible with radon, principally because the ratio of the river concentration to the groundwater concentration will be higher. However, hyporheic exchange can also contribute radon to the river. Where this process is significant, it is more difficult to estimate groundwater inflow from radon activities in the river, thus reducing the accuracy of the method. For CFCs, the lower limit of resolution is approximately 30mm/day. Helium has not been widely used but can potentially be very accurate if the groundwater is old. The method assumes steady-state conditions and so can only be applied when river flows are stable. Sampling resolution is also particularly important for dissolved gases, and uncertainty in where groundwater inflow occurs between sampling points can cause large uncertainty in inflow rates if the distance between sample locations is large. Poor mixing of solutes within the river can limit the method if the river is wide and shallow. When correctly applied, however, the environmental tracer method is able to provide robust estimates of groundwater discharge at a scale and accuracy that is not possible with most other methods.

42,"Phillips, JD",2015 ,"Hydrologic and geomorphic flow thresholds in the Lower Brazos River, Texas, USA",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,"River science and management often require a design or reference discharge. The common (and sometimes unavoidable) use of such discharges may, however, obscure the fact that the magnitude and frequency of critical flows can differ due to various hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological criteria. Threshold stages and discharges were identified for six lower Brazos River, Texas gaging stations corresponding to thalweg connectivity, bed inundation, high sub-banktop flows, channel-floodplain connectivity (CFC), and overbank flooding. Critical flows were also identified for estimated thresholds for sandy bedform and medium gravel mobility, critical specific stream power for potential channel modifications, and cohesive-bank channel erosion. These thresholds have variable relationships to mean, median, and maximum flows. For four of the six stations, daily recurrence probabilities for all but flood flows are at least 1%, and as high as 11%. All stations achieve channel-floodplain connectivity at stages less than banktop. Estimated threshold flows for sediment mobility and channel erosion occur relatively frequently, with daily probabilities of 2-77%. Critical flows for bank erosion occur least often, and for sandy bedform and gravel mobility most often. Thalweg connectivity is always maintained at all sites, while bed inundation flows have a daily probability of about 80% or more. Overall, results suggest that no single flow level is dominant in hydrological or geomorphic dynamics, and that the frequency of a given threshold varies considerably even along a single river. The results support the idea that multiple flow levels and ranges are necessary to create and maintain the hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological characteristics of rivers, and that no single flow level is a reliable determinant of fluvial state.Show less"
43,"Merck, MF",Sep 15 2012 ,Variability of in-stream and riparian storage in a beaded arctic stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The extent and variability of water storage and residence times throughout the open water season in beaded arctic streams are poorly understood. Data collected in Imnavait Creek, a beaded stream located north of the Brooks Range in Alaska, were used to better understand the effects of in-pool and riparian storage on heat and mass movement through beaded streams. Temperature data of high spatial resolution within the pools and surrounding sediments were used with volumetric discharge and electrical conductivity to identify storage areas within the pools, banks, and other marshy areas within the riparian zone, including subsurface flow paths that connect the pools. These subsurface flows were found to alter water conductivity and the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in short reaches (10 s of m) while influencing the chemistry of downstream pools. During low flow periods, persistent stratification occurred within the pools due to absorption of solar radiation by DOM coupled with permafrost below and low wind stress at the pool surface. Additionally, one of the shallow pools (<0.5?m depth) remained stratified during higher flow periods and lower radiation inputs due to dense subsurface flows entering the bottom of the pools. This consistent separation of surface and bottom water masses in each pool will increase the travel times through this and similar arctic watersheds, and therefore will affect the evolution of water chemistry and material export.

44,"van Meerveld, HJ",Jul 30 2015 ,Hillslope-riparian-stream connectivity and flow directions at the Panola Mountain Research Watershed,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"To obtain a better understanding of water's journey from the hillslope to the stream, water level time series from 26 groundwater wells in a hillslope-riparian study area in the Panola Mountain Research Watershed, Georgia, USA, were examined with respect to the occurrence of perched groundwater and groundwater flow directions. A connected groundwater table was taken as an indication of a hydrologic connection between the hillslope and the stream. Flow directions were determined based on observed water levels at different combinations of three neighbouring wells. The analyses indicated that the hillslope was disconnected from the stream most of the time but that almost the entire hillslope became connected to the stream during large rainfall events. This coincided with more sustained streamflow during these events. There were clear differences in the timing of the groundwater response between the upper hillslope, lower hillslope and riparian zone, with water levels near the stream and on the upper hillslope rising earlier than on the midslope. The flow directions were generally downslope and were most variable around a bedrock depression on the midslope. On the hillslope, the direction of the water table followed the local bedrock topography when the water level was low at the start and end of an event and the overall surface topography when water levels were high. In the riparian zone, flow directions either did not change significantly during events or turned from a more downstream (i.e. downvalley) direction to a more downslope (i.e. towards the stream) direction. These results highlight the competing influence of surface and bedrock topography on hillslope flow directions and improve our understanding of hillslope-riparian-stream connectivity.

45,"Lamontagne, S",Apr 2021 ,Groundwater-surface water connectivity in a chain-of-ponds semiarid river,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Semiarid rivers are often characterized by chains of small pools connected by riffles and wet meadows. The pools can be maintained by wet season surface runoff, groundwater discharge, or some combination thereof. Using synoptic surveys for several environmental tracers (delta D and delta O-18 of H2O, specific electrical conductance at 25 degrees C [EC], chloride and Rn-222), we evaluated the groundwater-surface water connectivity of the Light River (South Australia) along an 8 km section in the vicinity of a proposed mining development. In all three surveys (representing spring, summer and winter conditions), the pools were maintained by regional groundwater discharge based on an elevated surface water EC (9-12 dS m(-1)) similar to regional groundwater, elevated radon-222 activities (0.09-3.0 Bq L-1) and low rainfall. Most pools were perennial, either because they directly received groundwater discharge or, indirectly, had an inflow originating from upstream groundwater-fed pools. The elevated salinity of regional groundwater is a key factor for the maintenance of perennial pools in the Light River because the potential for baseflow depletion by groundwater pumping is more limited.Show less"

In this study, we used long-term surveys to assess the influence of habitat change, landscape alteration and invasive species on extinction risk of the native crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. We reviewed the existing literature to assess which ecosystem services are threatened by local extinction of A. pallipes and replacement with alien crayfish. We sampled 196 streams and wetlands in northern Italy. Of these, 117 received multiple surveys over a 13-year period (2004-2017), thus allowing accurate measurement of extinction rate. Thirty-four percent of A. pallipes populations underwent extinction between 2004 and 2017. The occurrence of alien crayfish in the catchment basin and urban growth in the landscape surrounding streams were associated with A. pallipes extinction. The probability of persistence was significantly higher in populations close to stream springs and with physical barriers (especially waterfalls) separating them from basins with alien crayfish. Extinction of native crayfish alters community structure and impairs regulating services such as detrital breakdown and pest regulation. Replacement by alien crayfish (Procambarus clarkii and Faxonius limosus) also threatens supporting and regulating services by altering nutrient cycling, food webs, sediments and erosion. The implementation of management practices that control river connectivity using selective barriers is needed to prevent further local extinction of native species. Integrating information on extinction with knowledge of impacts on ecosystem services is essential in developing more effective conservation policies.Show less"
47,"Naganna, SR",Jul 2018 ,Variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity in an intermittent stream reach regulated by Vented Dams: A case study,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hydro-geological properties of streambed together with the hydraulic gradients determine the fluxes of water, energy and solutes between the stream and underlying aquifer system. Dam induced sedimentation affects hyporheic processes and alters substrate pore space geometries in the course of progressive stabilization of the sediment layers. Uncertainty in stream-aquifer interactions arises from the inherent complex-nested flow paths and spatio-temporal variability of streambed hydraulic properties. A detailed field investigation of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K-s) using Guelph Permeameter was carried out in an intermittent stream reach of the Pavanje river basin located in the mountainous, forested tract of western ghats of India. The present study reports the spatial and temporal variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along the stream reach obstructed by two Vented Dams in sequence. Statistical tests such as Levene's and Welch's t-tests were employed to check for various variability measures. The strength of spatial dependence and the presence of spatial auto-correlation among the streambed K-s samples were tested by using Moran's I statistic. The measures of central tendency and dispersion pointed out reasonable spatial variability in K-s distribution throughout the study reach during two consecutive years 2016 and 2017. The streambed was heterogeneous with regard to hydraulic conductivity distribution with high-K-s zones near the backwater areas of the vented dam and low-K-s zones particularly at the tail water section of vented dams. Dam operational strategies were responsible for seasonal fluctuations in sedimentation and modifications to streambed substrate characteristics (such as porosity, grain size, packing etc.), resulting in heterogeneous streambed K-s profiles. The channel downstream of vented dams contained significantly more cohesive deposits of fine sediment due to the overflow of surplus suspended sediment-laden water at low velocity and pressure head. The statistical test results accept the hypothesis of significant spatial variability of streambed K-s but refuse to accept the temporal variations. The deterministic and geo-statistical approaches of spatial interpolation provided virtuous surface maps of streambed K-s distribution.Show less"

We apply double averaging (combined space and time averaging) to the LES results to determine the mean velocity distribution, momentum balance, and drag forces. Our simulations show large-scale freestream structures interacting strongly with vortices generated at the surfaces of individual spheres to control turbulent momentum fluxes into the bed. The transition between turbulent flow and Darcy flow occurs over the first row of spheres, where turbulence decays rapidly and turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and drag forces peak. Below this region, turbulence is only present in the high-velocity flow in open pore throats. Experimental observations suggest that minimum mean porewater velocity occurs in the first open pore space below the transition region, but our results show that the minimum occurs between the first and second pore spaces. The simulation mean porewater velocities are approximately half those captured in measurements because the model resolves the entire flow continuum while measurements can access high-velocity fluid in open pores. The high-resolution dual time-space averaging of the LES resolves both turbulent and mean flow features that are important to interfacial solute and particle fluxes, providing a means to include turbulent hyporheic exchange in upscaled river models, which has not been achieved to date.Show less"
49,"Boulton, AJ",Mar 2003 ,Optimizing a sampling strategy for assessing hyporheic invertebrate biodiversity using the Bou-Rouch method: Within-site replication and sample volume,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"To determine the optimal combination of sample volume and replication required to assess hyporheic taxa richness and abundance, 10 consecutive one-L Bou-Rouch pump samples were collected from each of 9 wells inserted in a 3 x 3 m grid at two sites on the Rhone River, France. Variable and non-linear relationships between sample volume and numbers of taxa and individuals demonstrate that hyporheic densities cannot simply be expressed per L for comparison among studies that have collected different sample volumes. Our results imply that an optimal sampling design for rapid assessment of hyporheic biodiversity and abundance would need at least five samples of 3-5 L to provide reasonable levels of precision (20%). At both sites, 6-7 replicates of 5 L sufficed to be able to detect a 50% change in mean taxa richness with a power of 0.90 and alpha = 0.10. Although this sampling exercise should be repeated whenever accurate population estimates are needed, it appears that the spatial variance of the hyporheos at a fine scale (<9 m(2)) is great enough to obscure detection of potentially large differences when replication or sample volume is small.Show less"
