Analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundary conditions, varying geometry of surface water-groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. To understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) bank storage, (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2-D hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. The numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower-regulated Lule River, northern Sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long-lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. Modelling results revealed that bank storage increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. When a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river-aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected bank storage. The presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity < 0.001 m d(-1) significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated bank storage. The bank storage return/fill time ratio was positively related to wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. Discharge oscillations with short duration and small amplitude decreased bank storage and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish-spawning locations. Based on these results, river regulation strategies can be improved by considering the effect of certain wave event configurations on hyporheic exchange to ensure harmonious hydrogeochemical functioning of the river-aquifer interfaces and related ecosystems.Show less"
1,"Stonedahl, SH",Nov 2015 ,Visualizing Hyporheic Flow Through Bedforms Using Dye Experiments and Simulation,JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,"Advective exchange between the pore space of sediments and the overlying water column, called hyporheic exchange in fluvial environments, drives solute transport in rivers and many important biogeochemical processes. To improve understanding of these processes through visual demonstration, we created a hyporheic flow simulation in the multi-agent computer modeling platform NetLogo. The simulation shows virtual tracer flowing through a streambed covered with two-dimensional bedforms. Sediment, flow, and bedform characteristics are used as input variables for the model. We illustrate how these simulations match experimental observations from laboratory flume experiments based on measured input parameters. Dye is injected into the flume sediments to visualize the porewater flow. For comparison virtual tracer particles are placed at the same locations in the simulation. This coupled simulation and lab experiment has been used successfully in undergraduate and graduate laboratories to directly visualize river-porewater interactions and show how physically-based flow simulations can reproduce environmental phenomena. Students took photographs of the bed through the transparent flume walls and compared them to shapes of the dye at the same times in the simulation. This resulted in very similar trends, which allowed the students to better understand both the flow patterns and the mathematical model. The simulations also allow the user to quickly visualize the impact of each input parameter by running multiple simulations. This process can also be used in research applications to illustrate basic processes, relate interfacial fluxes and porewater transport, and support quantitative process-based modeling.Show less"

The hydrolic model couples horizontal 2D Saint Venant equation for river flow and a 2D Dupuit equation for aquifer flow. The dynamic coupling between river and aquifer is provided by continuity of fluxes and water level elevation between the two domains. Equations are solved simultaneously by linking the two hydrological system matrices in a single global matrix in order to ensure the continuity conditions between river and aquifer and to accurately model two-way coupling between these two domains. The model is applied to a large reach (about 36 km(2)) of the Garonne River (south-western France) and its floodplain, including an instrumented site in a meander. Simulated hydraulic heads are compared with experimental measurements on the Garonne River and aquifer in the floodplain. Model verification includes comparisons for one point sampling date (27 piezometers, 30 March 2000) and for hydraulic heads variations measured continuously over 5 months (5 piezometers, 1 June 2000). The model accurately reproduces the strong hydraulic connections between the Garonne River and its aquifer, which are confirmed by the simultaneous variation of the water level in the river and in piezometers located near the river bank. The simulations also confirmed that the model is able to reproduce ground water flow dynamics during flood events. Given these result, the hydraulic model was coupled with a solute-transport component, based on advection-dispersion equations, to investigate the theoretical dynamics of a conservative tracer over 5 years throughout the 36 km(2) reach studied. Meanders were shown to favour exchanges between river and aquifer, and although the tracer was diluted in the river, the contamination moved from the injection plots and affected both river banks.

4,"Korbel, KL",Mar 10 2022 ,Dynamics of microbiotic patterns reveal surface water groundwater interactions in intermittent and perennial streams,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Exchange between groundwater (GW), hyporheic zone waters (HZ) and surface waters (SW) is critical for water quality, quantity, and the ecological health and functioning of all three ecosystems. Hydrological exchange is particularly important in intermittent creeks, such as in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia, where stream reaches shift from losing to gaining depending on the volume of surface flows. In this study we used hydrochemistry to identify SW-GW exchange and combined this with eDNA data to analyse the response of eukaryote and prokaryote communities to differing flow conditions within intermittent and perennial stream reaches. Our study suggested that SW and GW microbial communities were only around 30% similar. Differences in microbiota between SW, HZ and GW habitats were driven by changes in relative abundances of surface water dominant organisms (such as those capable of photosynthesis) as well as anaerobic taxa typical of GW environments (e.g., methanogens), with GW and HZ microbial communities becoming increasingly different to those in SW as flow ceased in intermittent creeks. Fine-scale hydrologic changes were identified through microbial communities in the perennial Maules Creek, indicating the importance of GW-SW exchange to biotic communities. This study highlights the importance of flow in shaping microbial communities and biogeochemical cycling within intermittent creeks and their connected alluvial aquifers. Our results suggest that microbiota may prove a useful indicator of SW-GW exchange, and in some circumstances, may be more sensitive in demonstrating fine-scale changes in SW-GW interactions than water chemistry. This knowledge furthers our understanding of GW-SW exchange and its impacts on ecological health.Show less"

This study evaluates how repeated daily stage fluctuations, representative of hydropeaking conditions, influence aerobic respiration of river-sourced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the riparian exchange zone using reactive flow and transport simulations. Over 50 hypothetical scenarios were modelled to evaluate how the duration of the daily flood signal, river DOC concentration, aquifer hydraulic conductivity and ambient groundwater flow condition affect the fate and transport of DOC and DO in the riparian aquifer. Time series subsurface snapshots highlight how the various factors influence the subsurface distribution of DOC and DO. The total mass of DOC respired per meter of river had a wide range depending on the parameters, spanning from 1.4 to 71 g over 24-h, with high hydraulic conductivity and losing ambient groundwater flow conditions favouring the largest amount of DOC respired. The ratio of DOC mass entering the riparian zone with the mass returning to the river showed that as little as 5% to as much as 76% of the DOC that enters the bank during stage fluctuations returns to the river. This return ratio is dependent on river DOC concentration, hydraulic conductivity and ambient groundwater flow. The results illustrate that stage variations due to river regulation can be a significant control on aerobic respiration in riparian exchange zones.Show less"
7,"Marchand, JP",Jul 2022 ,High-resolution spatiotemporal analysis of hydrologic connectivity in the historical floodplain of straightened lowland agricultural streams,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"In agricultural watersheds, human interventions such as channel straightening have disrupted the hydrologic connectivity between headwater streams and their riparian environment and have thus undermined the ecological services provided by these small streams. Knowledge of the hydrologic connectivity between these streams and their immediate environment (shallow riparian groundwater in the historical floodplain and on adjacent hillslopes) in human-impacted settings is critical for understanding and restoring these hydrological systems but remains largely incomplete. The objective of this research is to investigate the hydrogeomorphological conditions controlling hydrologic connectivity in the historical floodplain of straightened lowland streams. Detailed measurements on the spatiotemporal variability of groundwater-surface water interactions between straightened reaches, historical floodplain including abandoned meanders, and the adjacent hillslopes were obtained using a dense network of piezometers at two sites in the St. Lawrence Lowlands (Quebec, Canada). Results show that the complex mechanisms controlling hydrologic connectivity in naturally meandering lowland rivers also operate in highly disturbed straightened reaches, despite backfilling and agricultural practices. The pre-straightening hydrogeomorphological configuration of the floodplain partly explains the complex patterns of piezometric fluctuations observed at the sites. The apex of the abandoned meanders stands out as a focal area of hydrologic connectivity as water levels indicate pressure transfer that may reflect flows from the stream, the hillslopes, and the surrounding historical floodplain. These unique field observations suggest that abandoned meanders should be promoted as key elements of restoration strategies in lowland agricultural straightened headwater streams.Show less"
8,"He, L",2019 ,"Coupling Analysis of Connectivity between Coarse Sediment Source Areas and Deposition Area in the Yellow River, China",POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,"As a coupling river system, watershed management in sediment source areas may influence downstream reach. However, the connectivity between water and sediment retention (WSR) in two coarse sediment source areas (tributaries entering the Inner Mongolia Reach, IMR, and tributaries entering the Middle Yellow River, MYR) and deposition in the Lower Yellow River (LYR) have rarely been compared. Experiential fitted models for each river segment (IMR, MYR, and LYR) are loosely linked to investigate the coupling relationship between source areas and deposition area. Analysis shows that, at the zonal scale, the connectivity between WSR in different zones and deposition reduction in different river reaches differs. WSR in tributaries of the IMR may benefit the local channel (IMR) with a priority ratio, and WSR in the stem channel of the IMR may benefit both the local (IMR) and the lower (LYR) channels with almost the same magnitude. WSR in the MYR may benefit the local channel (LT reach) and the lower channel (LYR), while the LYR has more propriety. At the zonal scale, the temporal scales over which changes in hillslopes occur also differ, as WSR in the IMY and MYR during the non-flood season may also contribute to deposition reduction in the MYR and LYR. In total, the loosely linked model may provide information of sediment along the whole river network.Show less"
9,"Hu, HZ",Nov 2014 ,Impact of microforms on nitrate transport at the groundwater-surface water interface in gaining streams,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Small streambed structures (or microforms, 0.01-1 m in length) exist ubiquitously in riverbed systems. Small-scale topography is potentially important in controlling hyporheic exchange flow and transport of conservative and reactive solutes at the groundwater-surface water interface. The role of microforms on NO3- transfer in a riffle-scale (macroforms of > 1 m length) hyporheic zone within a gaining river setting is investigated using a 2-D flow and transport model which accounts for both nitrification and denitrification. Results show that the short pathlines caused by microforms lead to more NO3- discharge to the river compared with a macroform-only condition due to shortened residence times of both surface water and groundwater in mixing zones. Short hyporheic exchange flow pathways caused by microforms could remain oxic along their entire length or switch from nitrate producing to nitrate consuming as oxygen concentrations decline. Microforms affect net NO3- flux by the combined effect of introducing more stream mass flux and reducing their residence time in mixing zones under different hydrological and biogeochemical conditions. Our findings underscore that ignoring microforms in river beds may underestimate NO3- load to the river and have practical implications for pore water sampling strategies in groundwater-surface water studies.

10,"Storey, RG",Nov 2004 ,Spatial responses of hyporheic invertebrates to seasonal changes in environmental parameters,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Spatial relationships between hyporheic invertebrates and subsurface water flow patterns, sediment characteristics, water physicochemical parameters and several possible food sources were compared over three seasons at one site beneath a riffle. Measures of food sources included particulate organic matter (POM), bacterial activity (aerobic respiration, nitrate respiration and mineralisation of organic nitrogen) and microbial abundance.2. Patterns of water flow changed significantly over the 9-month study period, from predominantly upwelling beneath the entire riffle in spring, to distinct differentiation between downwelling and upwelling zones in summer and autumn. Water physicochemical parameters changed accordingly, showing gradually weaker correlations with depth and stronger correlations with zone between spring and autumn.3. Despite these changes, depth remained the strongest predictor of invertebrate richness, density and taxon composition throughout the study period. However, invertebrate distributions were secondarily correlated with water physicochemical parameters, and a minor gradient in invertebrate distributions between downwelling and upwelling zones became stronger from spring to summer.4. The correlations between invertebrates and physicochemical parameters changed in both magnitude and direction with season. In spring, invertebrates showed a negative correlation with surface water infiltration, whereas in summer and autumn, the correlation was positive. Correlations were strongest in summer, when interstitial dissolved oxygen concentrations were lowest.5. No relationships were found between hyporheic invertebrates and POM, microbial abundance or activity. This suggests that at this site, proximity to the streambed surface and physicochemical variables are more important than the abundance of food in controlling invertebrate distributions.Show less"
11,"Kunz, JV",Dec 2017 ,"Hyporheic Passive Flux Meters Reveal Inverse Vertical Zonation and High Seasonality of Nitrogen Processing in an Anthropogenically Modified Stream (Holtemme, Germany)",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Transformation and retention of nitrogen and other biologically reactive solutes in the hyporheic zones of running water contribute to an essential ecosystem service. However, the synoptic impact of intense agricultural or urban land-uses, elevated nutrient loading, flow alterations, riparian clear-cutting, and channelization on the source-sink behavior of solutes in hyporheic zones remains largely uncharacterized and unquantified. Therefore, we studied nutrient dynamics in a hydromorphologically and chemically modified stream reach using a new monitoring approach allowing the simultaneous measurement of nutrient and water flux through a screened area in the subsurface of rivers (hyporheic passive flux meter, HPFM). With HPFMs we directly assessed time-integrated lateral hyporheic nitrate fluxes during early spring and midsummer covering different temperature and discharge regimes. Contrary to our expectations, higher stream discharge coincided with substantially lower hyporheic exchange rates. While in streams featuring a natural morphology, bed form induced exchange commonly increases with surface flow, the influence of groundwater level was dominant in this reach. Furthermore, in contrast to less impacted environments, where progressive substrate depletion with depths reduces metabolic rates in the subsurface, we identified not the upper, but the intermediate layer of the hyporheic zone as hot spot of nutrient turnover. Overall, the hyporheic zone at the study site functioned partly as nitrate source, partly as a sink. Neither of the commonly used determinants redox state and residence time could explain this source or sink function. Our results give clear evidence to carefully transfer the knowledge of hyporheic zone processes from ""natural'' systems to anthropologically modified streams.Show less"
12,"Chestnut, TJ",Jun 2000 ,"C and N dynamics in the riparian and hyporheic zones of a tropical stream, Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Hydrologic and chemical characteristics were determined for both riparian and hyporheic subsurface flow along a 100-m reach of a sandy-bottom tributary of the Rio Icacos in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Hydrologic data (vertical hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments) and the topographic and morphological features of the watershed indicated diffuse inputs of groundwater from the near-stream riparian zone along this site. Cumulative groundwater discharge, determined by tracer dilution techniques, was similar to 1.5 L/s or 10% of the total stream discharge. Spatial heterogeneity in hydrologic and chemical properties of riparian and hyporheic sediments was large. Hydraulic conductivity explained much of the variation in NH4-N and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, with highest concentrations in sites having low conductivity. A mass-balance approach was used to examine the influence of the near-stream zone on nutrient transport and retention. Outwelling riparian groundwater had the potential to increase stream N concentrations by up to 84% and DOC concentrations by up to 38% along our 100-m reach. Because stream concentrations were constant downstream despite this input, we conclude that significant N and C retention or loss were occurring in the near-stream zone. Lotic ecosystems and their associated riparian groundwater can have a quantitatively significant impact on the nutrient budgets of tropical headwater catchments.Show less"
13,"Weber, MD",Jul 16 2013 ,Dynamic ice formation in channels as a driver for stream-aquifer interactions,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"This research introduces and provides evidence of a novel mechanism of stream-aquifer exchange caused by dynamic ice formation on streams. At a stream site in southwestern Wisconsin, we document a significant fluctuation in stream depth and the potentiometric surface in the adjacent aquifer during periods of ice formation, suggesting that stream-aquifer interactions may be influenced by these transient events. Four years of winter stream data document that dynamic ice formation (1) causes an average increase in stream depth of 106%, (2) affects stream depth on 20% of days from December through February, and (3) substantially alters stream-aquifer interactions by reducing the hydraulic gradient toward the channel during ice formation events. Dynamic ice formation represents a potentially widespread mechanism for altering stream-aquifer interactions and associated biogeochemical transformations. The sensitivity of this process to air temperature indicates a need for further research on the impacts of climate warming.Show less"
14,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",Aug 1998 ,Surface water-groundwater exchanges in three dimensions on a backwater of the Rhone River,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Hydrological exchange between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone is well documented in the main channel of rivers, especially at the reach scale. Hydrological processes of advection/convection occur at different scales, and in secondary channels of large rivers little is known about these exchanges in the hyporheic zone on a broad scale (i.e. kilometres). This work studied exchanges of water and biota in a secondary channel on a large scale (4 km), using a three-dimensional framework.2. The exchanges of water were described using physicochemical indicators of surface and groundwaters. Samples of water and biota were taken in three dimensions: (i) vertically from benthic (i.e. 0.20 m below the surface of the substratum) to hyporheic (0.50 m) and deep interstitial (1.0 m) zones; (ii) laterally from the right to the left bank (i.e. right, middle and left positions); and (iii) longitudinally from upstream to downstream (seven stations regularly distributed along the channel).3. The physicochemical indicators clearly revealed hydrological heterogeneity in the longitudinal and vertical dimensions, whereas lateral variability was not significant.4. Spatial distribution of biota exhibited strong longitudinal variations that were not gradual as predicted by an upstream/downstream continuum, but patchy and discontinuous. No significant differences were found between the three positions across the channel.5. Analyses of both physicochemical and faunal data sets produced matched ordination of samples and stations, indicating that interstitial-surface flow relationships appear to be an important governing factor in the distribution of interstitial biota at this broad scale.6. Results are discussed in relation to the hypothetical three-dimensional models of the hyporheic zone in rivers. Contrasting with other observations on the main channel (where advection/convection patterns are dominated by morphological changes of the river-bed morphology), it is proposed that water exchanges in backwaters are more likely to be related to local modifications of stream-bed porosity.Show less"
15,"Gartner, JD",May 15 2012 ,Time and depth scales of fine sediment delivery into gravel stream beds: Constraints from fallout radionuclides on fine sediment residence time and delivery,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Particles of fine sediment can clog interstitial pore spaces of coarser grained sediment in river beds and thereby impede the exchange of water, dissolved constituents, and particulate matter with consequent ecological impacts. The extent to which fine sediment reduces connectivity between the stream bed and overlying channel is a function, in part, of sediment residence time. Short residence times imply frequent exchange of matter and reduced impact of fine sediment on stream bed habitat, while long residence times indicate that with respect to fine sediment delivery, the stream bed is more isolated from the overlying channel. Here we present a novel technique to quantify the residence time of river bed sediment at various depths over annual and decadal timescales using the fallout radionuclides (FRNs) Be-7 (t(1/2) = 53 days) and (210)pb(ex) (t(1/2) = 22.3 years). We placed mesh cylinders filled with Be-7-free sediment into a stream bed to quantify the capture of Be-7-tagged particles in the absence of scour and fill. We also took cores to the depth of refusal in alluvial sediment in unregulated and regulated rivers in Vermont and New Hampshire. Sampled watershed areas ranged from 29 to 410 km(2), and core depths ranged from 19 to 77 cm. The Pb-210(ex) activity profiles of cores show that bed sediment is exchanged to the depth of refusal at decadal timescales. In contrast, 7Be activity profiles indicate that fine sediment infiltrating into the bed had residence times ranging from 4 to >300 days in unregulated rivers. Cores from a regulated river are notably different-subsurface sediment residence times were always longer than in unregulated rivers at comparable depths, likely owing to restriction of bed mobilization and clogging of bed material by fine sediment. These results suggest that filtration can be an important component of bed material delivery to stream beds, but filtration does not deliver material as deeply into the bed as scour and fill. We find that fallout radionuclides provide direct measurements of time and depth scales of active exchange of particulate matter, which are key controls on hyporheic function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluates the actual connectivity of ports and logistics in the Yangtze River Economic Belt of China by developing a comprehensive model with an integrated index. This comprehensive model uses an improved gravity model to develop and extend from the analysis of port-water transport network connectivity to the port-inland hinterland logistics connectivity, and unearths the key factors that affect the port-water and port-hinterland connectivity. The results show that the port connectivity in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is generally better than that of the middle and upper reaches, whether port-water or port-inland hinterland. Port connectivity has core-periphery characteristics, but Chongqing port is an exception in the results of port-water transport network connectivity. Because Chongqing port is in a leading position in the comprehensive development strength and hinterland economic development of ports in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, but its water transport network connectivity is not the best.

18,"Nagorski, SA",Nov 1999 ,Arsenic mobilization in the hyporheic zone of a contaminated stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Arsenic behavior was examined in a contaminated stream by sampling the dissolved (<0.45 mu m) arsenic and metals in surface water, shallow hyporheic zone water, and adjacent ground water. Surface water was oxic and slightly basic, and ground water was anoxic and acidic. Hyporheic zone water had pH values of 6-7, dissolved oxygen concentrations mostly between 0 and 3 mg L-1, and mean concentrations of most metals inbetween surface and ground water sample concentrations. However, arsenic and iron were enriched in the hyporheic zone. Most of the hyporheic zone dissolved arsenic was in the form of As(III), which is considered to be more toxic to some organisms than As(V). In the oxic surface water, 20% of the total dissolved As was found to occur in its reduced form. We hypothesize that upon burial and reduction of Fe-oxhydroxides in the streambed, sediment-bound arsenic is transferred into the dissolved phase as As(III), and it is subsequently released into the surface water, where it does not immediately reoxidize. A continual flux of reduced As to the surface water maintains Pb(III) concentrations above that expected in oxygenated surface waters.Show less"
19,"Birkel, C",Apr 2016 ,Heat-based hyporheic flux calculations in heterogeneous salmon spawning gravels,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Groundwater-surface water interactions in rivers are a critically important factor for fish spawning, as streamwater downwelling or upwelling of low-oxygen groundwater can affect egg survival. Assessing such dynamics at the reach scale using distributed temperature measurements as a tracer proved reliable in determining flux rates and directions in the hyporheic zone in a number of studies. Here, we report heat-based vertical flux rates from a heterogeneous gravel-bed stream reach used by spawning Atlantic salmon in the Scottish Highlands. Results showed mostly small downwelling fluxes (similar to 0.3 m d(-1)), which were largely independent of discharge. Contrasting, and at times unusual flux-depth profiles (e.g., increasing flux with depth) were detected, consistent with the heterogeneous streambed material causing diverse hyporheic flow paths. This was tested in a numerical 2-D model setup attempting to reproduce such behavior with variable random hydraulic conductivity (K) fields. The 2-D model clearly demonstrated that strong deviations from the expected decrease of fluxes with depth can be explained by high heterogeneity coupled with relatively low K fields. This showed that using simple 1-D heat-based flux estimates in combination with 2-D models is a useful approach to testing hypotheses about the influence of variable streambed materials on groundwater-surface water exchange in an ecological context.Show less"
20,"Clilverd, HM",Nov 2016 ,Coupled Hydrological/Hydraulic Modelling of River Restoration Impacts and Floodplain Hydrodynamics,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Channelization and embankment of rivers has led to major ecological degradation of aquatic habitats worldwide. River restoration can be used to restore favourable hydrological conditions for target species or processes. However, the effects of river restoration on hydraulic and hydrological processes are complex and are often difficult to determine because of the long-term monitoring required before and after restoration works. Our study is based on rarely available, detailed pre-restoration and post-restoration hydrological data collected from a wet grassland meadow in Norfolk, UK, and provides important insights into the hydrological effects of river restoration. Groundwater hydrology and climate were monitored from 2007 to 2010. Based on our data, we developed coupled hydrological/hydraulic models of pre-embankment and post-embankment conditions using the MIKE-SHE/MIKE 11 system. Simulated groundwater levels compared well with observed groundwater. Removal of the river embankments resulted in widespread floodplain inundation at high river flows (>1.7m(3)s(-1)) and frequent localized flooding at the river edge during smaller events (>0.6m(3)s(-1)). Subsequently, groundwater levels were higher and subsurface storage was greater. The restoration had a moderate effect on flood peak attenuation and improved free drainage to the river. Our results suggest that embankment removal can increase river-floodplain hydrological connectivity to form a more natural wetland ecotone, driven by frequent localized flood disturbance. This has important implications for the planning and management of river restoration projects that aim to enhance floodwater storage, floodplain species composition and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.

21,"Boano, F",Jul 27 2010 ,A linear model for the coupled surface-subsurface flow in a meandering stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The interest about the exchange of water between streams and aquifers has been increasing among the hydrologic community because of the implications of the exchange of heat, solutes, and colloids for the water quality of aquatic environments. Unfortunately, our understanding of the relevance of the exchange processes is limited by the great number of coupled hydrological and geomorphological factors that interact to generate the complex spatial patterns of exchange. In this context, the present work presents a mathematical model for the surface-subsurface exchange through the streambed of a meandering stream. The model is based on the linearization of the equations that govern the hydrodynamics and the morphodynamics of the system, and it provides a first-order analytical solution of the coupled flow field of both the surface and the subsurface flows. The results show that stream curvature determines a characteristic spatial pattern of hyporheic exchange, with water upwelling and downwelling concentrated near the stream banks. The exchange can drive surface water deep into the sediments, thus keeping deep alluvium regions connected with the stream. The relationships between hyporheic exchange flux and the geometrical and hydrodynamical properties of the stream-aquifer system are also investigated.Show less"
22,"Marzadri, A",Nov 17 2011 ,A semianalytical three-dimensional process-based model for hyporheic nitrogen dynamics in gravel bed rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We present a three-dimensional semianalytical process-based model of dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) transformation within the hyporheic zone of gravel bed rivers. Oxygen and multispecies solute transport is solved within a Lagrangian framework with transformation of DIN species modeled by linearized Monod's kinetics, with temperature-dependent reaction rate coefficients derived from field experiments. Our solutions, which are obtained under the assumptions of sediments with uniform hydraulic properties and negligible local dispersion, highlight the importance of morphological characteristics of the streambed on DIN transformations within the hyporheic zone. By means of this model we explore the effects of streambed topography and relative abundance of ammonium and nitrate in stream waters on the reactive nitrogen cycle in the hyporheic zone of gravel bed rivers with a pool and riffle morphology. Our model shows complex concentration dynamics within the hyporheic zone that may act as a source or a sink of nitrogen depending on the residence time distribution, which can be parameterized in terms of streambed morphology, and the ratio between the in-stream concentrations of ammonium and nitrate. Application of the model to seven natural streams shows good agreement between predicted and measured nitrous oxide emissions from their hyporheic zone.Show less"
23,"Li, AG",Feb 2021 ,Residence Time in Hyporheic Bioactive Layers Explains Nitrate Uptake in Streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization (TASCC) model has been rapidly adopted to interpret in-stream nutrient spiraling metrics over a range of concentrations from breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained during pulse solute injection experiments. TASCC analyses often identify hysteresis in the relationship between spiraling metrics and concentration as nutrient concentration in BTCs rises and falls. The mechanisms behind these hysteresis patterns have yet to be determined. We hypothesized that differences in the time a solute is exposed to bioactive environments (i.e., biophysical opportunity) between the rising and falling limbs of BTCs causes hysteresis in TASCCs. We tested this hypothesis using nitrate data from Elkhorn Creek (CO, USA) combined with a process-based particle-tracking model representing travel times and transformations along each flow path in the water column and hyporheic zone, from which the bioactive zone comprised only a thin superficial layer. In-stream nitrate uptake was controlled by hyporheic exchange and the cumulative time nitrate spend in the bioactive layer. This bioactive residence time generally increased from the rising to the falling limb of the BTC, systematically generating hysteresis in the TASCC curves. Hysteresis decreased when nutrient uptake primarily occurred in the water column compared to the hyporheic zone, and with increasing the distance between the injection and sampling points. Hysteresis increased with the depth of the hyporheic bioactive layer. Our results emphasize that good characterization of spatial heterogeneity of surface-subsurface flow paths and bioactive hot spots within streams is essential to understanding the mechanisms of in-stream nutrient uptake.Show less"
24,"Qian, Q",Jul 31 2008 ,A vertical dispersion model for solute exchange induced by underflow and periodic hyporheic flow in a stream gravel bed,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Interstitial flows in stream gravel beds are driven by stream slope and controlled by hydraulic conductivity (underflows) or induced by pressure differentials on the streambed surface (hyporheic flows). They enhance solute exchange between surface water and a streambed. To study the solute transport in a stream gravel bed, a 2-D transient advection dispersion mass transfer model was formulated. The velocity field includes an underflow and a spatially periodic hyporheic flow, e. g., due to standing surface waves or bed forms. Two dimensionless scaling parameters emerged: R measures the relative strength of hyporheic flow to underflow in the streambed and l is the ratio of dispersivity of the gravel bed to the pressure wavelength along the streambed. In the analysis of mass transfer of nonconservative substances into a streambed, an explicit 2-D analysis of interstitial flow is often undesirable. Therefore the numerical solutions for the 2-D concentration fields under periodic boundary conditions were reduced to 1-D vertical concentration profiles ( by streamwise averaging of the solute concentrations). The profiles were matched to the solution of an unsteady vertical 1-D dispersion equation that introduces a depth variable ""enhanced dispersion coefficient D(E)(y)'' that lumps all forms of interstitial advective and dispersive transport in the streambed. Functions D(E)(y) were determined for many combinations of independent parameters by inverse modeling, and the dependence of D(E)(y) on the dimensionless parameters R and gimel was determined from these results. Analytical relationships for D(E)(y, R, gimel) have been proposed and validated against available experimental data. Knowledge of D(E)(y) allows the estimation of solute/mass transfer rates in streambeds under wavy boundary conditions, without explicit analysis of the interstitial flow. This is a distinct advantage for applications in stream water quality and/or pore water quality studies.Show less"
25,"Uzarski, DG",Jul 1 2001 ,A new chamber design for measuring community metabolism in a Michigan stream,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"We designed an open-ended community metabolism chamber to simultaneously measure surface and hyporheic metabolism. Our chamber design eliminated reaeration, compartmentalized metabolism, maintained ambient conditions and included hyporheic respiration. We compared results from our hyporheic chamber to results obtained from: (1) closed benthic community metabolism chambers constructed as recommended by Bott et al. (1978), and (2) whole-stream metabolism techniques as modified by Marzolf et al. (1994). Simultaneous comparisons of all three procedures were made for a 35 m riffle section of Augusta Creek, a 3rd-order Michigan stream, in July 1997 and repeated in July 1998. Simultaneous comparisons of all three procedures were also made for a 30 m sandy run section of Augusta Creek in September 1997, and repeated in September 1998. Our hyporheic chamber estimates for community respiration (CR24) were similar to those obtained using the whole-stream metabolism procedure but were considerably higher than estimates obtained using the closed benthic chambers in three of the four experiments. These data suggest that our chamber design provided estimates of community metabolism which included both benthic and hyporheic respiration. The chamber incorporates several positive aspects of both closed chambers and the whole-stream method. This new method can be replicated, eliminates the need for a reaeration coefficient, ambient conditions are better approximated since it remains an open system, and it appears to provide more realistic estimates of whole-stream metabolism compared to the traditional chamber approach.Show less"
26,"Boano, F",Feb 13 2010 ,Biogeochemical zonation due to intrameander hyporheic flow,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The dynamics of chemicals within a catchment are strongly affected by the exchange between surface water and groundwater. The activity of hyporheic microorganisms plays a key role in these processes, as they are able to oxidize and reduce organic matter and nutrients. The interplay between the residence times in the hyporheic zone and the temporal scales of the microbial reactions must thus be understood in order to improve our understanding of the role of fluvial environments in nutrient cycling. In this paper we focus on the intrameander hyporheic region and investigate the links between river morphology, hyporheic flow field, and biogeochemical processes. We adopt a modeling framework that considers the planimetric evolution of a meandering river, the hyporheic flow field induced by the river sinuosity, and the main biogeochemical reactions of organic carbon degradation. The chemical zonation of the intrameander hyporheic zone clearly emerges as a result of the coupling between hyporheic flow and biochemical activity. The resulting patterns of nutrient concentrations are strongly influenced by the river morphology. We also show how to estimate the characteristic timescales of the redox reactions and that their interplay with the kinematic timescales of the hyporheic flow controls both the biochemical zonation and the overall rate of nutrient transformation.Show less"
27,"Mueller, BM",Feb 18 2021 ,Simultaneous attenuation of trace organics and change in organic matter composition in the hyporheic zone of urban streams,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Trace organic compounds (TrOCs) enter rivers with discharge of treated wastewater. These effluents can contain high loads of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In a 48 h field study, we investigated changes in molecular composition of seven DOM compound classes (FTICR-MS) and attenuation of 17 polar TrOCs in a small urban stream receiving treated wastewater. Correlations between TrOCs and DOM were used to identify simultaneous changes in surface water and the hyporheic zone. Changes in TrOC concentrations in surface water ranged between a decrease of 29.2% for methylbenzotriazole and an increase of 152.2% for the transformation product gabapentin-lactam. In the hyporheic zone, only decreasing TrOC concentrations were observed, ranging from 4.9% for primidone to 93.8% for venlafaxine . TrOC attenuation coincided with a decline of molecular diversity of easily biodegradable DOM compound classes while molecular diversity of poorly biodegradable DOM compound classes increased. This concurrence indicates similar or linked attenuation pathways for biodegradable DOM and TrOCs. Strong correlations between TrOCs and DOM compound classes as well as high attenuation of TrOCs primarily occurred in the hyporheic zone. This suggests high potential for DOM turnover and TrOC mitigation in rivers if hyporheic exchange is sufficient.Show less"

We evaluate the performance of the current Fourier fitting process by testing on different scenarios of synthetic surfaces. We identify a technical gap and propose a new version of the approach which incorporates the spectral analysis method to help identify the statistically significant frequencies of the surface to guide the refinement and mesh. Our results show that spectral analysis is the method that can help improve the accuracy of representing the surface, thus further improving the accuracy of predicting the bedform-driven hyporheic exchange flows.Show less"
29,"Mojarrad, BB",Jan 2023 ,Convergence of Groundwater Discharge through the Hyporheic Zone of Streams,GROUNDWATER,"Significant attention has been given to hyporheic water fluxes induced by hydromorphologic processes in streambeds and the effects they have on stream ecology. However, the impact of hyporheic fluxes on regional groundwater flow discharge zones as well as the interaction of these flows are much less investigated. The groundwater-hyporheic interactive flow not only governs solute mass and heat transport in streams but also controls the retention of solute and contamination following the discharge of deep groundwater, such as naturally occurring solutes and leakage from geological waste disposal facilities. Here, we applied a physically based modeling approach combined with extensive hydrologic, geologic and geographical data to investigate the effect of hyporheic flow on groundwater discharge in the Krycklan catchment, located in a boreal landscape in Sweden. Regional groundwater modeling was conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics by considering geologic heterogeneity and infiltration constraint of the groundwater circulation intensity. Moreover, the hyporheic flow was analyzed using an exact spectral solution accounting for the fluctuating streambed topography and superimposed with the regional groundwater flow. By comparing the discharge flow fields with and without consideration of hyporheic flows, we found that the divergence of the discharge was substantially enhanced and the distribution of the travel times of groundwater was significantly shifted toward shorter times due to the presence of hyporheic flow. Particularly important is that the groundwater flow paths contract near the streambed interface due to the hyporheic flow, which leads to a phenomenon that we name ""fragmentation"" of coherent areas of groundwater upwelling in pinhole-shaped stream tubes.Show less"
30,"Ren, J",Jun 2019 ,Using water temperature series and hydraulic heads to quantify hyporheic exchange in the riparian zone,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Surface-water/groundwater exchange through the evaluation of riparian-zone temperature data has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The Fox Ditch Canal, Nevada, USA, was chosen for this study on seasonal variations of riparian-zone water exchange. Groundwater temperature and hydraulic head real-time monitoring data were collected from March to November 2012. A calibrated hydro-thermal coupling model was used to characterize the riparian-zone temporal and spatial temperature distribution, thereby providing a standard against which the performances of four analytical solution models for calculated riparian-zone vertical seepage velocity could be assessed. The results indicated that the proposed model provided a simulation that was able to represent dynamic changes in riparian-zone soil temperature. Although small variations in patterns and magnitudes of riparian-zone water exchange were evident at a daily scale, they varied significantly over a seasonal scale. Comparison of the results of the four analytical solutions and numerical computation found that the Hatch solution by the amplitude method provided the highest accuracy for calculating groundwater velocity in this area (2.47x10(-6) to 3.15x10(-6) m/s). Global sensitivity analysis of hydro-thermal coupling model parameters showed that porosity had the most significant impact on temperature in the model.Show less"
31,"Leng, PF",Aug 2021 ,Temporal Patterns of Methane Emissions From Two Streams With Different Riparian Connectivity,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Streams are regionally important sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, but the temporal variability in and control on CH4 concentrations and emissions are not well understood. Especially, lack of long-term data hampers our ability to predict CH4 emissions from streams. Here, we present a 7-year data set of biweekly CH4 concentration and underlying potential drivers from two adjacent small German streams with contrasting riparian area characteristics. Over the 7-year study period, mean CH4 concentration and emissions were 0.20 and 0.07 mu mol L-1 and 2.01 and 0.84 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for the two streams, respectively. Our findings suggest that the combination of seasonality and topography ultimately shaped the considerable temporal variations of CH4. CH4 oxidation and production in the streams were probably of minor importance. Instead, fluctuations in CH4 concentrations likely reflected a temporal pattern of CH4 input from soils of the riparian zone with larger CH4 variations in the stream with more riparian lands. Structural equation modeling revealed dissolved organic carbon and nitrate as important predictors of CH4 concentration. However, we did not identify predictors of the considerable short-term variability, nor the explicit pathways of CH4 delivery to streams. The discrepancy of the CH4 flux between streams was likely triggered by different connectivities to riparian soils with higher CH4 emissions in the hydrologically more connected stream. Interannual comparison showed that changing hydrologic conditions, rather than warming, may impact future CH4 emissions from temperate streams. We predict that higher CH4 emissions occur in wetter years in streams with close connectivity to riparian soils.Show less"
32,"Clark, C",Sep 2021 ,Reach-scale stream temperature response to large wood placement,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,"Climate change models indicate that stream temperatures within much of the Columbia River Basin will increase significantly in the next 50 years leading to inhospitable conditions for salmonid fishes in several stream reaches. Restoration measures such as riparian planting, maintaining instream flows, and large wood (LW) placement are thought to ameliorate the impacts of climate change on stream temperatures. While LW placement is known to improve habitat complexity, it is unclear whether it will also help reduce summer stream temperatures. To help understand the influence of LW placement on stream temperatures, we monitored nine interior Columbia River Basin LW projects using an extensive posttreatment study design. We mapped stream bottom temperatures, topography, and physical habitat in paired treatment (LW placement) and control reaches to compare water temperatures and cool-water patches between reaches. We found no difference in the mean or the variance in overall reach temperatures or thalweg temperatures between treatment and control reaches. Mapping found variation in water temperatures of less than 0.5 degrees C within reaches, making mapping of cool-water patches impractical and further emphasized the lack of temperature differences. Our results indicate that LW placement projects in the interior Columbia River Basin do not appear to be decreasing reach-scale summer water temperatures or creating cool water refugia for fishes. Moreover, the current configuration and implementation of LW placement projects, which typically focus on placing wood on banks and channel margins, are unlikely to ameliorate the effects of climate change on stream temperatures.Show less"
33,"Wohl, E",Jun 30 2021 ,"Rediscovering, Reevaluating, and Restoring Lost River-Wetland Corridors",FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"River-wetland corridors form where a high degree of connectivity between the surface (rheic) and subsurface (hyporheic) components of streamflow creates an interconnected system of channels, wetlands, ponds, and lakes. River-wetland corridors occur where the valley floor is sufficiently wide to accommodate a laterally unconfined river planform that may feature morphologically complex, multi-threaded channels with vegetated bars, islands, and floodplains. River-wetland corridors can develop anywhere there is valley expansion along a drainage network, from the headwaters to estuaries or deltas, and they are found across all latitudes and within all biomes and hydroclimates. River-wetland corridors may be longitudinally continuous but are commonly interspersed with single-thread reaches in narrower portions of the valley. The development and persistence of river-wetland corridors is driven by combinations of geologic, biotic, and geomorphic processes that create a river environment that is diverse, heterogeneous, patchy, and dynamically stable, and within which patterns of flow, sediment features, and habitats shift continually. Hence, we describe these polydimensional river corridors as ""kaleidoscope rivers."" Historically, river-wetland corridors were pervasive in wide, alluvial valley reaches, but their presence has been so diminished worldwide (due to a diverse range of anthropogenic activities and impacts) that the general public and even most river managers are unaware of their former pervasiveness. Here, we define river-wetland corridors as a river type; review paleoenvironmental and historical records to establish their past ubiquity; describe the geologic, biotic, and geomorphic processes responsible for their formation and persistence; and provide examples of river-wetland corridor remnants that still survive. We close by highlighting the significance of the diverse river functions supported by river-wetland corridors, the consequences of diminution and neglect of this river type, and the implications for river restoration.Show less"
34,"Poole, GC",Jun 2006 ,Multiscale geomorphic drivers of groundwater flow paths: subsurface hydrologic dynamics and hyporheic habitat diversity,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Application of a hydrogeologic computer model underscored the importance of geomorphic controls on groundwater and surface-water flow dynamics in the Nyack Floodplain, a montane alluvial floodplain in Montana, USA. The model represented the floodplain as a hierarchy of geomorphic patches, which facilitated analysis of model results using independent (predictor) variables at multiple scales. The analyses revealed that geomorphic structures at various spatial scales interact with the flow regime to influence the direction, magnitude, and stability of hyporheic flow within individual floodplain patches. Specifically: 1) the hydrologic flow network within the hyporheic zone is more responsive to seasonal changes in river discharge if floodplain topography is complex and aquifer properties are heterogeneous, 2) simplification of internal patch structure across the floodplain eliminates the influence of fine-scale geomorphic structures on the stability of groundwater flow paths, although the influence of patch context remains, and 3) incremental changes in river discharge can abruptly and substantially restructure the relationship between river discharge and groundwater flow patterns when events such as inundation of previously dry flood channels occur on the floodplain. We believe that ecological theories of biodiversity can be used to understand interactions among geomorphic variation, hydrologic dynamics, and the maintenance of biodiversity in the hyporheic zone if abrupt reorganization and other variations in groundwater flow paths act as disturbances to hyporheic communities. From this perspective, we used model results to develop 4 hypotheses describing the potential for causal linkages among floodplain geomorphology, hyporheic flow-path variation, hyporheic habitat diversity/stability, and hyporheic community diversity.Show less"
35,"Holmes, RM",May 1996 ,Denitrification in a nitrogen-limited stream ecosystem,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Denitrification was measured in hyporheic, parafluvial, and bank sediments of Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a nitrogen-limited Sonoran Desert stream. We used three variations of the acetylene block technique to estimate denitrification rates, and compared these estimates to rates of nitrate production through nitrification. Subsurface sediments of Sycamore Creek are typically well-oxygenated, relatively low in nitrate, and low in organic carbon, and therefore are seemingly unlikely sites of denitrification. However, we found that denitrification potential (C & N amended, anaerobic incubations) was substantial, and even by our conservative estimates (unamended, oxic incubations and field chamber nitrous oxide accumulation), denitrification consumed 5-40% of nitrate produced by nitrification. We expected that denitrification would increase along hyporheic and parafluvial flowpaths as dissolved oxygen declined and nitrate increased. To the contrary, we found that denitrification was generally highest at the upstream ends of subsurface flowpaths where surface water had just entered the subsurface zone. This suggests that denitrifiers may be dependent on the import of surface-derived organic matter, resulting in highest denitrification rate at locations of surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange. Laboratory experiments showed that denitrification in Sycamore Creek sediments was primarily nitrogen limited and secondarily carbon limited, and was temperature dependent. Overall, the quantity of nitrate removed from the Sycamore Creek ecosystem via denitrification is significant given the nitrogen-limited status of this stream.Show less"

Accurate spatial evaluation of river network connectivity is necessary for providing an improved empirical basis for management, conservation, and restoration initiatives. In this study, we focused on the stream continuity-oriented hydrological connectivity of the river network ecosystem. An evaluation model was established using spatiotemporal hydrological data, temporal data on dam development, and a new stream continuity-oriented connectivity index (SCI). The Pearl River basin was selected as the study area to demonstrate the model application using data since 1960. The model showed that the SCI values had significantly and steadily decreasing characteristics in the entire basin from 1960 to 2018, with a total decrease during this period of 26% throughout the river network. The connectivity of the river network declined as the number of dams increased, and dams built on main trunks had a larger impact on the connectivity than those on tributaries. These model results can help government regulators identify the worst connected areas of the river network and take effective measures to reduce the impact of human interferences. Thus, the model can provide practical guidance and support to the conservation, management, and restoration of the river ecosystem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
37,"Boyraz, U",2014 ,An investigation on the effect of geometric shape of streams on stream/ground water interactions and ground water flow,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,"Ground water should be used efficiently and improved for sustainable water management plans. For this purpose, comprehensive ground water flow models are developed incorporating surface/ground water interactions. Typically, these models require a significant amount of hydrological parameters and the sensitivities of these parameters on interaction mechanisms need to be clarified. Therefore, in this study, the role of the geometric shape of the stream on stream/ground water interactions is investigated. First, an analytical solution for two-dimensional ground water flow is developed with sloping stream boundary in an isotropic and homogeneous aquifer. Then, ground water head distribution and hyporheic exchange flow between stream and aquifer are obtained by conducting sensitivity analyses with prototype models developed using Visual MODular Finite-Difference FLOW in order to observe individual effects of each stream property. Finally, by incorporating the highest possible stream/ground water interaction conditions into a conceptual stream-aquifer model, the combined effects of different stream shapes are interpreted. Results show that slope, abrupt slope change, and flow path of stream affect the interactions significantly. Moreover, interaction flow rates increase further under the combined effects of these stream properties. The outputs of this work will ultimately be used in site investigations and in forecasting ground water hydrology.Show less"

In this paper, we develop river connectivity indices to explain biodiversity patterns, prioritize reaches that need habitat restoration and barriers that need improvement. We provide a general framework for calculating connectivity indices by dis-entangling the contribution of the river network's physical setup (structural connectivity) from the process-driven and biota-related contribution (functional connectivity). To facilitate the calculations, the R package 'riverconn' is introduced. A prioritization of habitats and barriers is carried out for the Ebro river (North-West Iberian Peninsula) using indices setups accounting for different classes of organisms and dispersal traits. Resulting prioritizations are very diverse. 'Riverconn' can support scientists and managers working on riverscape planning and population and community ecology by providing a means to compute and compare a wide array of fragmentation indices.Show less"
39,"Li, AG",Aug 2017 ,Covariation in patterns of turbulence-driven hyporheic flow and denitrification enhances reach-scale nitrogen removal,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Coinjections of conservative tracers and nutrients are commonly used to assess travel time distributions and nutrient removal in streams. However, in-stream tracer data often lack information on long-term hyporheic storage, and removal rate coefficients are often assumed to be uniform despite plentiful evidence that microbially mediated transformations, such as denitrification, exhibit strong spatial variability in the hyporheic zone. We used process-based particle-tracking simulations to explore the coupled effects of spatial patterns in hyporheic flow and denitrification on reach-scale nitrogen removal. We simulated whole-stream nitrogen dynamics with exponential, layered, and uniform profiles of hyporheic denitrification. We also simulated nitrogen dynamics in Little Rabbit Creek, an agricultural headwater stream in the Kalamazoo River Basin (Michigan, USA) where vertical profiles of hyporheic denitrification were measured in situ. Covariation between pore water velocity and mixing causes rapid exchange in the near-surface bioactive region and substantially prolonged exchange in the deeper hyporheic. Patterns of hyporheic denitrification covary with patterns of hyporheic flow. This covariation directly controls tailing of in-stream breakthrough curves and hence reach-scale nutrient removal. Enhanced denitrification near the sediment-water interface strongly tempers breakthrough curve tails at time scales associated with flushing of the near-surface region, while more spatially uniform denitrification causes weaker tempering over a wider range of hyporheic exchange time scales. At the reach scale, overall nitrogen removal increases with heterogeneity of hyporheic denitrification, indicating that covariation between flow and denitrificationparticularly the rapid flushing of highly bioactive regions near the sediment-water interfacecontrols whole-stream transformation rates.Show less"
40,"STANLEY, EH",Jul 1995 ,HYPORHEIC PROCESSES DURING FLOODING AND DRYING IN A SONORAN DESERT STREAM .1. HYDROLOGIC AND CHEMICAL-DYNAMICS,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"We examined the effects of flooding and prolonged drying on interstitial water chemistry in the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran Desert stream at three sites with different flow regimens. Sampling began immediately after a winter flood rewetted the previously dry stream, and ended when a summer flash flood destroyed many sampling wells 170 days later. Nitrate-N, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and dissolved oxygen concentrations were high whereas ammonium-N was low at all sites at the beginning of the study period. As discharge declined and drying began, nutrient and dissolved oxygen concentrations declined in phreatic (> 50 cm deep) and parafluvial (lateral to the active channel) subsystems while shallow hyporheic (< 50 cm) samples remained well-oxygenated. Hyporheic water chemistry in areas lacking surface flow (the dry channel hyporheic) varied between sites; nitrate-N and dissolved oxygen decreased at one site but increased at another. With continued drying, phreatic and parafluvial habitats became extremely hypoxic (< 0.50 mg/L dissolved oxygen) and low in nitrate-N (< 0.02 mg/L) due to reduced hydrologic exchange between surface and hyporheic waters. The increased area of hypoxia apparently enhanced nitrate-reducing transformations in phreatic and parafluvial habitats because interstitial nitrate-N concentrations often were lower than surface values; thus, drying caused a functional shift in this N-limited stream as the hyporheic zone changed from a nitrate source to a nitrate sink. Boundaries of hyporheic subsystems fluctuated considerably in response to flooding and drying, underscoring the importance of hydrologic extremes to the strength of chemical linkages between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone.Show less"
41,"Caruso, BS",Oct 2015 ,A hydrologic connectivity index for jurisdictional analysis of headwater streams in a montane watershed,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"A hydrologic connectivity index (HCI) was developed to aid the US Clean Water Act Section 404 jurisdictional evaluation of headwater streams in montane watersheds, using the Cement Creek Watershed in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado as a case study. Jurisdictional determinations are required for many intermittent and ephemeral streams, where significant nexus with downstream traditional navigable waters (TNWs) must be evaluated. Three biophysical metrics (a streamflow metric, distance from the stream to the TNW, and slope between the stream and the TNW) for 239 streams in the watershed were used to develop three indices. These were then combined to develop the HCI, which is a compound, additive index. There was a large range of HCI values for ephemeral streams, which all require a significant nexus evaluation to determine jurisdiction. Statistical analysis of HCI values across stream duration and order classes showed that mean values differed significantly among classes. The flow index component constituted the greatest proportion of the HCI for perennial streams, was sensitive to the flow metrics used, and was greatest for high flows. Although ephemeral streams are only connected to the TNW less than 3 months of the year, the cumulative average annual flow contribution of ephemeral first-order streams can be 5 % of the total to the TNW, and their flow contribution is larger during high flows. Some ephemeral streams with high HCI values are farthest from the TNW but contribute the greatest flow out of all ephemeral reaches, and may have significant nexus with the river. The study shows that the HCI can be useful for initial evaluation of connectivity, significant nexus, and jurisdiction of headwaters at the watershed scale.Show less"
42,"Wallace, CD",Mar 2021 ,Surface water-groundwater exchange dynamics in buried-valley aquifer systems,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Groundwater is a primary source of drinking water worldwide, but excess nutrients and emerging contaminants could compromise groundwater quality and limit its usage as a drinking water source. As such contaminants become increasingly prevalent in the biosphere, a fundamental understanding of their fate and transport in groundwater systems is necessary to implement successful remediation strategies. The dynamics of surface water-groundwater (hyporheic) exchange within a glacial, buried-valley aquifer system are examined in the context of their implications for the transport of nutrients and contaminants in riparian sediments. High conductivity facies act as preferential flow pathways which enhance nutrient and contaminant delivery, especially during storm events, but transport throughout the aquifer also depends on subsurface sedimentary architecture (e.g. interbedded high and low conductivity facies). Temperature and specific conductance measurements indicate extensive hyporheic mixing close to the river channel, but surface water influence was also observed far from the stream-aquifer interface. Measurements of river stage and hydraulic head indicate that significant flows during storms (i.e., hot moments) alter groundwater flow patterns, even between consecutive storm events, as riverbed conductivity and, more importantly, the hydraulic connectivity between the river and aquifer change. Given the similar mass transport characteristics among buried-valley aquifers, these findings are likely representative of glacial aquifer systems worldwide. Our results suggest that water resources management decisions based on average (base) flow conditions may inaccurately represent the system being evaluated, and could reduce the effectiveness of remediation strategies for nutrients and emerging contaminants.Show less"

This research used nonmobile, porous bed flume experiments and hydrodynamic simulation (CFD) to characterize hyporheic flow paths below a river step with a hydraulic jump. Bed slope was 1%, step height was 4 cm, downstream flow depth was 4 cm, substrate was 1 cm median diameter gravel, and hydraulic jump length was 25 cm in the flume and CFD experiments. With the hydraulic jump, flow paths changed to include downwelling beneath the water plunging into the pool and upstream-directed upwelling at the base of the step and beneath the length of jump. Failure to represent the influence of static and dynamic pressures associated with hydraulic jumps leads to erroneous prediction of subsurface flow paths in 75% of the streambed beneath the jump. A refined conceptual model for hyporheic flow paths below a step with a hydraulic jump includes reversed hyporheic circulation cells, in which downwelling water moves upstream and then upwells, and flow reversals, in which the larger flow net of downstream-directed upwelling encounters a nested flow path of upstream-directed upwelling. Heterogeneity in hyporheic flow paths at hydraulic jumps has the potential to explain field-observed mosaics in streambed redox patterns and expand structure-function relationships used in river management and restoration.Show less"

This included the drawing of potentiometric maps, measuring hydraulic conductivity and porosity, and the monthly analysis of major chemical elements in water samples.Use of the combined data led to the clarification of certain aspects of the characteristics, functioning and development of the hyporheic zone.Even though the area studied lies in a zone of groundwater recharge, the direct vertical exchange between surface-and groundwater does not seem to be determinant in the potentiometric and chemical development of the area. However, the state of reserves, which can be reduced or reconstituted, seems to play an essential role in flow dynamics, and thus of the chemistry of this area. Flow dynamics in the hyporheic zone apparently are of the longitudinal-transversal type, related to the local stream morphology.The results show how difficult it is to define the hyporheic zone in a structural sense, even though the zone represents an entity that is clearly characterized by specific and identifiable dynamics.Show less"

In this study, the types of connectivity have been defined on the basis of two components, namely ""physical contact"" and ""transfer of material."" Based on this, four types of connectivity are recognized. These are (a) active connected system, (b) inactive connected system, (c) partially active connected system, and (d) disconnected system. Connectivity indices have been proposed based on the process understanding of different types of connectivity. This conceptual understanding of connectivity has been applied to the Ganga dispersal system, a large river system. Results of the connectivity analysis on the Ganga dispersal system reveal that different sets of data such as sediment budgets, geochemical isotopic data and radiogenic (U-238-U-234-Th-230) data are noncoherent. Therefore, developing rigorous and well constrained quantitative multidisciplinary data sets is needed to have a better understanding of connectivity at multiple spatiotemporal scales in large river dispersal systems; this would ultimately help model the dynamics of such systems.

Pollution of groundwater induced by inflow of river water enabled recognition of relative differences in the amount of inflowing water. Biogeochemical zonation is a characteristic feature of the investigated groundwater. Inflow of river water is most intensive in the zone of about 1/3 of the bend width, parallel to the channel. It is characterized by macroions concentrations higher than that in the river. Outside, in the central part of the bend, concentrations of macroions significantly decrease. In this part of the bend, the largest head gradient also is observed. It increases toward the apex, and close to the river channel it equals about 40 cm. Groundwaters in the distal part of the bend are the least mineralized as a result of dilution by rain water. Investigations suggest a slow exchange of the hyporheic waters because of the prevalence of sandy-silty sediments. It favours transformation of nitrates, sulphates, and iron mobility in reducing conditions. Reducing their load in the river can be remarkable over the 30 km meandering reach of this river.Show less"

The strength of the exchange directly affects the biogeochemical and ecological processes that occur in the hyporheic zone and aquifer from micro to reach scales. Hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) can be quantified using many field measurement approaches, however, in a relatively large river (scale >10(3) m), these approaches are limited by site accessibility, the difficulty of performing representative sampling, and the complexity of geomorphologic features and subsurface properties. In rivers regulated by hydroelectric dams, quantifying HEF rates becomes more challenging because of frequent hydropeaking events, featuring hourly to daily variations in flow and river stages created by dam operations. In this study, we developed and validated a new approach based on field measurements to estimate shallow water HEF rates across the river bed along the shoreline of the Columbia River, USA. Vertical thermal profiles measured by self-recording thermistors were combined with time series of hydraulic gradients derived from river stages and inland water levels to estimate the HEF rates. The results suggest that the HEF rates had high spatial and temporal heterogeneities over the riverbed, with predicted flux rates varied from +1 x 10(-6) m s(-1) to -1.5 x 10(6) m s(-1) under different flow conditions.Show less"
49,"Harrison, LR",Nov 2019 ,"Physical Controls on Salmon Redd Site Selection in Restored Reaches of a Regulated, Gravel-Bed River",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Large-scale river restoration programs have emerged recently as a tool for improving spawning habitat for native salmonids in highly altered river ecosystems. Few studies have quantified the extent to which restored habitat is utilized by salmonids, which habitat features influence redd site selection, or the persistence of restored habitat over time. We investigated fall-run Chinook salmon spawning site utilization and measured and modeled corresponding habitat characteristics in two restored reaches: a reach of channel and floodplain enhancement completed in 2013 and a reconfigured channel and floodplain constructed in 2002. Redd surveys demonstrated that both restoration projects supported a high density of salmon redds, 3 and 14 years following restoration. Salmon redds were constructed in coarse gravel substrates located in areas of high sediment mobility, as determined by measurements of gravel friction angles and a grain entrainment model. Salmon redds were located near transitions between pool-riffle bedforms in regions of high predicted hyporheic flows. Habitat quality (quantified as a function of stream hydraulics) and hyporheic flow were both strong predictors of redd occurrence, though the relative roles of these variables differed between sites. Our findings indicate that physical controls on redd site selection in restored channels were similar to those reported for natural channels elsewhere. Our results further highlight that in addition to traditional habitat criteria (e.g., water depth, velocity, and substrate size), quantifying sediment texture and mobility, as well as intragravel flow, provides a more complete understanding of the ecological benefits provided by river restoration projects.Show less"
