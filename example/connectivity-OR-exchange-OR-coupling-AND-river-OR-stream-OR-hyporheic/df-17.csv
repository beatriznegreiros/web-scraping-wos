0,"Boon, PJ",Feb 2016 ,The regional hyporheic fauna of gravel-bed rivers and environmental controls on its distribution,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) of rivers is important for functional processes and a critical habitat for a specialist biota (the hyporheos). Knowledge of the hyporheos and its variability within and between rivers, however, remains limited at all scales. This paper describes an extensive survey of the invertebrate fauna and the physicochemical characteristics of the HZ, through sampling 25 geographically dispersed Scottish rivers. Invertebrates were collected using two techniques for comparison of depth of sampling and effectiveness of invertebrate retrieval: Bou-Rouch pumping using standpipes inserted to 0.5 m depth and Karaman-Chappuis pit sampling. The faunal assemblage was dominated by Oligochaeta, cyclopoid Copepoda, Nematoda and Diptera, which accounted for almost 80 % of individuals. The fauna of pits and standpipes was influenced by different but related variables; distance to source and source altitude were strong predictors of pit faunal composition, compared with site altitude and longitude in standpipes. These factors suggest a general biogeographical component to the composition of the hyporheos. Pit assemblages were also influenced by conductivity, and standpipes by total alkalinity, implying a secondary influence of water chemistry or productivity. Explained variation in faunal composition in standpipes was significantly greater than for pits suggesting a higher degree of environmental determinism and associated specialization within the deeper hyporheos. Faunal richness was positively correlated with dissolved oxygen saturation in pit and pipe samples highlighting potential sensitivity to temperature-related effects, siltation and eutrophication. Inclusion of hyporheic sampling in biological assessments might result in greater nature conservation significance being attributed to the hyporheos, thus supporting a call for greater recognition of the HZ and its associated services in environmental protection.Show less"

These fluxes sustain a rich ecotone, whose habitat quality depends on their direction and magnitude. The spatiotemporal variability of hyporheic fluxes is not well understood over several temporal scales and consequently, we studied their spatial and temporal variation over a pool-riffle-pool sequence at multiple locations from winter to summer. We instrumented a pool-riffle-pool sequence of Bear Valley Creek, an important salmonid spawning gravel-bed stream in central Idaho, with temperature monitoring probes recording at high temporal resolution (12 minute intervals). Using the thermal time series, weekly winter season seepage fluxes were calculated with a steady-state analytical solution and spring-summer fluxes with a new analytical solution that can also quantify the streambed thermal properties. Longitudinal pool-riffle-pool conceptualizations of downwelling and upwelling behavior were generally observed, except during the winter season when seepage fluxes tended toward downwelling conditions. Seepage fluxes near the edges of the channel were typically greater than fluxes near the center of the channel, and demonstrated greater seasonal variability. Results show that the interaction between streamflow and streambed topography has a primary control near the center of the channel, whereas the interaction between stream water and groundwater table has a primary control on seepage fluxes near the banks of the stream.Show less"
3,"Huang, T",Feb 2022 ,Removal of Fecal Indicator Bacteria by River Networks,WATER,"Fecal contamination is a significant source of water quality impairment globally. Aquatic ecosystems can provide an important ecosystem service of fecal contamination removal. Understanding the processes that regulate the removal of fecal contamination among river networks across flow conditions is critical. We applied a river network model, the Framework for Aquatic Modeling in the Earth System (FrAMES-Ecoli), to quantify removal of fecal indicator bacteria by river networks across flow conditions during summers in a series of New England watersheds of different characteristics. FrAMES-Ecoli simulates sources, transport, and riverine removal of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Aquatic E. coli removal was simulated in both the water column and the hyporheic zone, and is a function of hydraulic conditions, flow exchange rates with the hyporheic zone, and die-off in each compartment. We found that, at the river network scale during summers, removal by river networks can be high (19-99%) with variability controlled by hydrologic conditions, watershed size, and distribution of sources in the watershed. Hydrology controls much of the variability, with 68-99% of network scale inputs removed under base flow conditions and 19-85% removed during storm events. Removal by the water column alone could not explain the observed pattern in E. coli, suggesting that processes such as hyporheic removal must be considered. These results suggest that river network removal of fecal indicator bacteria should be taken into consideration in managing fecal contamination at critical downstream receiving waters.Show less"
4,"Briggs, MA",Oct 1 2019 ,Return flows from beaver ponds enhance floodplain-to-river metals exchange in alluvial mountain catchments,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River to floodplain hydrologic connectivity is strongly enhanced by beaver- (Castor canadensis) engineered channel water diversions. The hydroecological impacts are wide ranging and generally positive, however, the hydrogeochemical characteristics of beaver-induced flowpaths have not been thoroughly examined. Using a suite of complementary ground- and drone-based heat tracing and remote sensing methodology we characterized the physical template of beaver-induced floodplain exchange for two alluvial mountain streams near Crested Butte, Colorado, USA. A flowpath-oriented perspective to water quality sampling allowed characterization of the chemical evolution of channel water diverted through floodplain beaver ponds and ultimately back to the channel in 'beaver pond return flows'. Subsurface return flow seepages were universally suboxic, while ponds and surface return flows showed a range of oxygen concentration due to in-situ photosynthesis and atmospheric mixing. Median concentrations of reduced metals: manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and arsenic (As) were substantially higher along beaver-induced flowpaths than in geologically controlled seepages and upstream main channel locations. The areal footprint of reduced return seepage flowpaths were imaged with surface electromagnetic methods, indicating extensive zones of high-conductivity shallow groundwater flowing back toward the main channels and emerging at relatively warm bank seepage zones observed with infrared. Multiple-depth redox dynamics within one focused seepage zone showed coupled variation over time, likely driven by observed changes in seepage rate that may be controlled by pond stage. High-resolution times series of dissolved Mn and Fe collected downstream of the beaver-impacted reaches demonstrated seasonal dynamics in mixed river metal concentrations. Al time series concentrations showed proportional change to Fe at the smaller stream location, indicating chemically reduced flowpaths were sourcing Al to the channel. Overall our results indicated beaver-induced floodplain exchanges create important, and perhaps dominant, transport pathways for floodplain metals by expanding chemically-reduced zones paired with strong advective exchange.

5,"Stewardson, MJ",Apr 15 2016 ,Variation in reach-scale hydraulic conductivity of streambeds,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Streambed hydraulic conductivity is an important control on flow within the hyporheic zone, affecting hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes essential to river ecosystem function. Despite many published field measurements, few empirical studies examine the drivers of spatial and temporal variations in streambed hydraulic conductivity. Reach-averaged hydraulic conductivity estimated for 119 surveys in 83 stream reaches across continental France, even of coarse bed streams, are shown to be characteristic of sand and finer sediments. This supports a model where processes leading to the accumulation of finer sediments within streambeds largely control hydraulic conductivity rather than the size of the coarse bed sediment fraction. After describing a conceptual model of relevant processes, we fit an empirical model relating hydraulic conductivity to candidate geomorphic and hydraulic drivers. The fitted model explains 72% of the deviance in hydraulic conductivity (and 30% using an external cross-validation). Reach hydraulic conductivity increases with the amplitude of bedforms within the reach, the bankfull channel width-depth ratio, stream power and upstream catchment erodibility but reduces with time since the last streambed disturbance. The correlation between hydraulic conductivity and time since a streambed mobilisation event is likely a consequence of clogging processes. Streams with a predominantly suspended load and less frequent streambed disturbances are expected to have a lower streambed hydraulic conductivity and reduced hyporheic fluxes. This study suggests a close link between streambed sediment transport dynamics and connectivity between surface water and the hyporheic zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
6,"Hendricks, SP",Jun 1996 ,"Bacterial biomass, activity, and production within the hyporheic zone of a north-temperate stream",ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Bacterial biomass, activity, and production were examined within the hyporheic zone of a sandy-bed, north-temperate stream over three seasons. Date (November, February, and May), zone (upwelling, downwelling), and depth (10 cm, 50 cm into the bed) were significant main effects on bacterial variables. Biomass and production were significantly higher in May than during November and February, and generally higher at the 10 cm depth than at the 50 cm depth. Activity was higher in the downwelling zone in November followed by a minor peak in May. Production in the downwelling zone in May was 10-fold that of the upwelling zone. Response by bacteria to DOC enrichments (glucose, humic acid) was inconsistent and statistically insignificant. However, some general trends emerged which were consistent with observations for unenriched sediments. Bacterial activity increased with DOC enrichment only in the downwelling zone during November and May. Bacterial production in the downwelling zone increased with DOC enrichment only during November. Hyporheic bacterial patterns reflected generally higher metabolic activities (electron transport activity, thymidine uptake into DNA) within the downwelling zone, a region of greater surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange within the streambed and presumably higher DOC quality from surface-derived labile sources.Show less"
7,"Sackett, JD",Oct 21 2019 ,Microbial Community Structure and Metabolic Potential of the Hyporheic Zone of a Large Mid-Stream Channel Bar,GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL,"To develop a greater understanding of hyporheic zone microbial biogeochemistry, we sampled pore fluids from a piezometer array associated with the McCarran Ranch channel bar (MRCB); a partially submerged cobble island in the Truckee River, NV, USA. Flowing surface water and pumped pore fluids were characterized by prokaryotic community structure, metabolic potential, and aqueous physicochemistry. Concentrations of potential respiratory electron acceptors were highest in surface water and riverbed porewater and sequentially depleted in porewaters along the inferred flowpath (O-2, then NO3-, then SO42-). Correspondingly, cultivable nitrate reducers/denitrifiers were most abundant in surface water and riverbed porewater, despite oxic conditions. Cultivable sulfate reducers were overall most abundant in surface water. Prokaryotic community reconstruction from 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that the surface water community was less diverse than that of porewater and supports a shift in metabolic strategy, from aerobic heterotrophy in surface water (e.g., Comamonadaceae and Sporichthyaceae) to chemolithotrophy and anaerobic metabolisms (e.g., Hydrogenophaga spp., Ferribacterium spp., Methanobacterium spp.) along the hyporheic flow path. These data indicate that prokaryotic communities within the MRCB are phylogenetically and metabolically diverse and contribute to biogeochemical cycling in this common yet relatively understudied habitat.Show less"
8,"Caschetto, M",Jun 2017 ,"Evaluation of the sources of nitrogen compounds and their influence on the biological communities in the hyporheic zone of the Sagittario River, Italy: an isotopic and biological approach",ITALIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,"In groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) a significant contribution of nitrogen contamination of the surface waters arises from groundwater input by shallow and deep flow systems. In general, nitrogen surface-groundwater exchanges and processes at the hyporheic scale are difficult to monitor. In order to have a better understanding about these interactions, it is proposed to use stable isotopes (N-15-NO3-, O-18-NO3-, N-15-NH4+) as environmental tracers to identify the sources and fate of the nitrogen compounds in groundwater in the Sagittario River basin, central Italy. The detrimental effect of the groundwater ammonium on the meiofaunal organisms is also evaluated in the hyporheic zone, where N-NH4+ concentrations reach a maximum value of 0.6 mg L-1. The main source of the nitrogen contamination originates from agricultural and urban activities at the catchment scale. The nitrogen compounds reach the gaining stretches of the hyporheic zone along the streambed as nitrate associated to a shallow flow system and ammonium related to a deep flow system. delta N-15 data demonstrate that sewage and fertilizers including manure are the main sources of NO3- and NH4+, the latter being the major pollutant in the study area. delta O-18-NO3- data are consistent with the nitrification of ammonium to nitrate, along with the contribution from inorganic fertilizers. Furthermore, delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- data reveal that denitrification does not play any role on nitrate attenuation in the shallow aquifer and near the discharge areas to the river. The meiofaunal communities, represented by the Crustacea Copepoda selected as the target group, were shown to be sensitive to the high concentration of ammonium found at several hyporheic sites. The statistical analyses indicated a significant reduction of species abundance in the sites polluted by N-NH4+ concentrations > 0.0653 mg L-1.Show less"
9,"Frei, S",Sep 15 2009 ,Patterns and dynamics of river-aquifer exchange with variably-saturated flow using a fully-coupled model,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The parallel physically-based surface-subsurface model PARFLOW was used to investigate the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of river-aquifer exchange in a heterogeneous alluvial river-aquifer system with deep water table. Aquifer heterogeneity at two scales was incorporated into the model. The architecture of the alluvial hydrofacies was represented based on conditioned geostatistical indicator simulations. Subscale variability of hydraulic conductivities (K) within hydrofacies bodies was created with a parallel Gaussian simulation. The effects of subscale heterogeneity were investigated in a Monte Carlo framework. Dynamics and patterns of river-aquifer exchange were simulated for a 30-day flow event. Simulation results show the rapid formation of saturated connections between the river channel and the deep water table at preferential flow zones that are characterized by high conductivity hydrofacies. Where the river intersects low conductivity hydrofacies shallow perched saturated zones immediately below the river form, but seepage to the deep water table remains unsaturated and seepage rates are low. Preferential flow zones, although only taking up around 50% of the river channel, account for more than 98% of total seepage. Groundwater recharge is most efficiently realized through these zones. Subscale variability of K-sat slightly increased seepage volumes, but did not change the general seepage patterns (preferential flow zones versus perched zones). Overall it is concluded that typical alluvial heterogeneity (hydrofacies architecture) is an important control of river-aquifer exchange in rivers overlying deep water tables. Simulated patterns and dynamics are in line with field observations and results from previous modeling studies using simpler models. Alluvial heterogeneity results in distinct patterns and dynamics of river-aquifer exchange with implications for groundwater recharge and the management of riparian zones (e.g. river channel-floodplain connectivity via saturated zones).

10,"Zhao, QH",Oct 2022 ,Optimizing Management Practices to Reduce Sediment Connectivity between Forest Roads and Streams in a Mountainous Watershed,REMOTE SENSING,"Forest roads often increase runoff and sediment loss, thus greatly impacting hydrological processes in mountainous watersheds. While there has been previous investigation on best management practices (BMPs) to reduce soil erosion from forest roads, few studies have attempted to optimize BMPs based on how much they can decrease sediment connectivity between forest roads and streams. To close this gap in knowledge, we analyzed the spatial relationship between forest roads and streams, presented the spatial distribution of sediment connectivity by integrating the forest roads into the calculation of the index of connectivity (IC), determined how sediment connectivity would respond to additional BMPs through simulating scenarios, and used these data to optimize the BMPs so they would intercept the greatest sediment loads. We found that forest roads and streams in the Xiangchagou watershed in the Dabie Mountain area of China tend to occur within 180 m of each other; however, within the same buffer zones, streams are more often accompanied by forest roads. IC was greatest near road-stream crossings but smaller near streams and forest roads, and it tended to decrease as the buffer distance increased. Furthermore, we found that sediment connectivity was decreased through running a variety of scenarios that used sediment basin and riparian buffers as BMPs between forest roads and streams. Specifically, within this watershed, riparian buffers should be 64 m wide, and there should be 30 sediment basins with a minimum upslope drainage area of 2 ha. At these quantities, the BMPs in this watershed would significantly affect sediment connectivity. By contrast, beyond these thresholds, increasing the width of riparian buffers or the number of sediment basins does not lead to meaningful sediment reductions. In this way, we were able to use the mean change point method to determine the optimal sediment basin quantity (30 with corresponding minimum upslope drainage area of 2 ha) and the optimal riparian buffer width (64 m) for the Xiangchagou watershed. While these results are a first approximation in a novel research area, they can guide forest managers and stakeholders to design and optimize BMPs that control the delivery of eroded sediments associated with forest roads.Show less"
11,"Mugnai, R",Aug 2015 ,The hyporheic zone and its functions: revision and research status in Neotropical regions,BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY,"The hyporheic zone (HZ), as the connecting ecotone between surface-and groundwater, is functionally part of both fluvial and groundwater ecosystems. Its hydrological, chemical, biological and metabolic features are specific of this zone, not belonging truly neither to surface-nor to groundwater. Exchanges of water, nutrients, and organic matter occur in response to variations in discharge and bed topography and porosity. Dynamic gradients exist at all scales and vary temporally. Across all scales, the functional significance of the HZ relates to its activity and connection with the surface stream. The HZ is a relatively rich environment and almost all invertebrate groups have colonized this habitat. This fauna, so-called hyporheos, is composed of species typical from interstitial environment, and also of benthic epigean and phreatic species. The hyporheic microbiocenose consists in bacteria, archaea, protozoa and fungi. The HZ provides several ecosystem services, playing a pivotal role in mediating exchange processes, including both matter and energy, between surface and subterranean ecosystems, functioning as regulator of water flow, benthic invertebrates refuge and place of storage, source and transformation of organic matter. The hyporheic zone is one of the most threatened aquatic environments, being strongly influenced by human activities, and the least protected by legislation worldwide. Its maintenance and conservation is compelling in order to preserve the ecological interconnectivity among the three spatial dimensions of the aquatic environment. Although several researchers addressed the importance of the hyporheic zone early, and most contemporary stream ecosystem models explicitly include it, very little is known about the HZ of Neotropical regions. From a biological standpoint, hyporheos fauna in Neotropical regions are still largely underestimated. This review focuses on a brief presentation of the hyporheic zone and its functions and significance as an ecotone. We also highlighted the key aspects considering also the current status of research in Neotropical regions.Show less"

The river has two segments; the Lower Jordan River, which is impaired for dissolved oxygen (DO) and the Upper Jordan River, which is fast flowing with coarse sediments and has no DO impairment. Summer SOD values for the Lower Jordan River ranged from a high 2.2g DO/m(2) per day to a low of 0.97g DO/m(2) per day with most of the sampled sites in the Lower Jordan River having SOD values greater than 1g DO/m(2) per day. SOD values correlated well with volatile solids in surface sediments of the Lower Jordan River. The Upper Jordan River showed SOD values as high as 3.0g DO/m(2) per day, which was attributed to hyporheic exchanges or groundwater upwelling. All sampled sites exhibited high SOD values in winter. A modified chamber method was employed to estimate community respiration (CR24), GPP, and NDM, while characterizing both the water column and benthos. In summer 2010, the sediment tray primary production (TPP) ranged from 1.0 to 7.4g DO/m(2) per day. In winter 2011, TPP ranged from 0.7g DO/m(2) per day to a high value of 5.6g DO/m(2) per day. NDM values indicated that the Upper Jordan River is a year round source of in-stream produced organic matter to the downstream Lower Jordan River with the majority of organic matter produced in the benthos. Reaeration measurements showed that the potential for reaeration is much higher in the mid-sections of the Jordan River, where the river has increased flow velocities due to topography, decreased depths, and a less uniform bottom.Show less"
14,"Geist, DR",Aug 2000 ,"Hyporheic discharge of river water into fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning areas in the Hanford Reach, Columbia River",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawned predominantly in areas of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River where hyporheic water discharged into the river channel. This upwelling water had a dissolved solids content (i.e., specific conductance) indicative of river water and was presumed to have entered highly permeable riverbed substrate at locations upstream of the spawning areas. Hyporheic discharge zones composed of undiluted ground water or areas with little or no upwelling were not used by spawning salmon. Rates of upwelling into spawning areas averaged 1200 L.m(-2).day(-1) (95% CI = 784-1665 L.m(-2).day(-1)) as compared with approximately 500 L.m(-2).day(-1) (95% CI = 303-1159 L.m(-2).day(-1)) in nonspawning areas. Dissolved oxygen content of the hyporheic discharge near salmon spawning areas was about 9 mg.L-1 (+/- 0.4 mg.L-1) whereas in nonspawning areas, dissolved oxygen values were 7 mg.L-1 (+/- 0.9 mg.L-1) or lower. In both cases, dissolved oxygen of the river water was higher (11.3 +/- 0.3 mg.L-1). Physical and chemical gradients between the hyporheic zone and the river may provide cues for adult salmon to locate suitable spawning areas. This information will help fisheries managers to describe the suitability of salmon spawning habitat in large rivers.Show less"
15,"Ren, JH",Sep 1 2005 ,"Coupled stream-subsurface exchange of colloidal hematite and dissolved zinc, copper, and phosphate",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Previous studies have shown that stream-subsurface exchange has important implications for both colloid and reactive solute transport in streams because it increases the opportunity for the interaction of stream-born substances with bed sediments. We executed a series of laboratory flume experiments to study the coupled stream-subsurface exchange of hematite and the sorbing solutes zinc, copper, and phosphate. A fundamental process-based transport model was applied to analyze the experimental results. We found that hematite had a significant effect on the transport of all ions tested. In addition, hematite mobility was substantially modified by the presence of these solutes. Batch and column experiments showed that the difference in hematite mobility was a direct effect of zinc, copper, and phosphate sorption to the hematite surface. Sorption substantially modified the hematite surface charge and subsequently hematite filtration behavior. These results suggest that the behavior of contaminants cannot be analyzed separately from colloids in surface and groundwater systems because surface-chemical processes can cause their behavior to be coupled. In particular, our results show that general and specific interactions between contaminants and iron oxide particles can alter colloid mobility, perturb natural fine particle dynamics, and either favor or disfavor contaminant mobility.Show less"
16,"Sethi, SA",Dec 2017 ,High value of ecological information for river connectivity restoration,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,"Efficient restoration of longitudinal river connectivity relies on barrier mitigation prioritization tools that incorporate stream network spatial structure to maximize ecological benefits given limited resources. Typically, ecological benefits of barrier mitigation are measured using proxies such as the amount of accessible riverine habitat.We developed an optimization approach for barrier mitigation planning which directly incorporates the ecology of managed taxa, and applied it to an urbanizing salmon-bearing watershed in Alaska.A novel river connectivity metric that exploits information on the distribution and movement of managed taxon was embedded into a barrier prioritization framework to identify optimal mitigation actions given limited restoration budgets. The value of ecological information on managed taxa was estimated by comparing costs to achieve restoration targets across alternative barrier prioritization approaches.Barrier mitigation solutions informed by life history information outperformed those using only river connectivity proxies, demonstrating high value of ecological information for watershed restoration. In our study area, information on salmon ecology was typically valued at 0.8-1.2 M USD in costs savings to achieve a given benefit level relative to solutions derived only from stream network information, equating to 16-28% of the restoration budget.Investing in ecological studies may achieve win-win outcomes of improved understanding of aquatic ecology and greater watershed restoration efficiency.Show less"
17,"Tull, N",Mar 2022 ,Bidirectional River-Floodplain Connectivity During Combined Pluvial-Fluvial Events,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydrologic connectivity controls the lateral exchange of water, solids, and solutes between rivers and floodplains, and is critical to ecosystem function, water treatment, flood attenuation, and geomorphic processes. This connectivity has been well-studied, typically through the lens of fluvial flooding. In regions prone to heavy rainfall, the timing and magnitude of lateral exchange may be altered by pluvial flooding on the floodplain. We collected measurements of flow depth and velocity in the Trinity River floodplain in coastal Texas (USA) during Tropical Storm Imelda (2019), which produced up to 75 cm of rainfall locally. We developed a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model at high resolution for a section of the Trinity River floodplain inspired by the compound flooding of Imelda. We then employed Lagrangian particle routing to quantify how residence times and particle velocities changed as flooding shifted from rainfall-driven to river-driven. Results show that heavy rainfall initiated lateral exchange before river discharge reached flood levels. The presence of rainwater also reduced floodplain storage, causing river water to be confined to a narrow corridor on the floodplain, while rainwater residence times were increased from the effect of high river flow. Finally, we analyzed the role of floodplain channels in facilitating surface-water connectivity by varying model resolution in the floodplain. While the resolution of floodplain channels was important locally, it did not affect as much the overall floodplain behavior. This study demonstrates the complexity of floodplain hydrodynamics under conditions of heavy rainfall, with implications for sediment deposition and nutrient removal during floods.Plain Language Summary Unaltered river floodplains can support diverse ecosystems, reduce flooding, and remove nutrients from river water. Floodplains near the coast are particularly important, as they typically experience more frequent flooding. Floodplain function relies on a high degree of connectivity with the river, where water can move easily through the floodplain during periods of high river stage. Our study explores the ways in which heavy rainfall on a floodplain impacts this connectivity. We collected flow measurements in the Trinity River floodplain (Texas, USA) during Tropical Storm Imelda in 2019 that showed distinct flooding patterns between the rainfall and river flooding. We coupled a hydrodynamic model with a particle tracking model to see how particles in the water might move through the floodplain during the transition from rainfall-driven to river-driven flooding. We found that the average time a particle spent in the floodplain changed significantly after the rain in the model stopped. We also noticed that rainwater generally remained in the floodplain for much longer than river water, especially after the rain stopped. This study describes the various interactions that can occur between local rainfall and river flooding and moves toward a better understanding of sediment and nutrient transport in floodplains.Show less"

Many previous studies solely investigated the HE induced by pool-riffle bedforms or meanders but few research studied the interactions between them despite this pair of morphology generally coexisting in natural streams. Adopting similar laboratory and numerical methods as Huang and Chui (2021), https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029182 whose pool-riffle streams were straight, this study adequately studied the impacts of hydraulic and morphologic factors on the HE in meandering pool-riffle streams and highlighted the mutual influence among various factors such as bedform amplitude and sinuosity. The results show that meanders significantly complicate the three-dimensional hyporheic flow paths and increase the flowrate and scale of HE. The HE flowrate increases linearly with discharge, bed slope, and sinuosity. The total HZ volume and maximum lateral and vertical extents of HZ generally increase with discharge. They also increase with bed slope and sinuosity but only up to a particular threshold, and they remain nearly constant or slightly decrease after exceeding the threshold. All HE characteristics exponentially decrease with both losing and gaining groundwater flow, and losing conditions have less significant effects on the HE compared with gaining conditions. The HE in stream bank can be larger than that in streambed, and the former is generally more influenced by discharge and sinuosity than the latter. Effects of bedform amplitude on HE exhibit very complex patterns due to the mutual influence of key factors.Show less"
20,"Gerecht, KE",Mar 22 2011 ,Dynamics of hyporheic flow and heat transport across a bed-to-bank continuum in a large regulated river,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The lower Colorado River (LCR) near Austin, Texas is heavily regulated for hydropower generation. Daily water releases from a dam located 23 km upstream of our study site in the LCR caused the stage to fluctuate by more than 1.5 m about a mean depth of 1.3 m. As a result, the river switches from gaining to losing over a dam storage-release cycle, driving exchange between river water and groundwater. We assessed the hydrologic impacts of this by simultaneous temperature and head monitoring across a bed-to-bank transect. River-groundwater exchange flux is largest close to the bank and decreases away from the bank. Correspondingly, both the depth of the hyporheic zone and the exchange time are largest close to the bank. Adjacent to the bank, the streambed head response is hysteretic, with the hysteresis disappearing with distance from the bank, indicating that transient bank storage affects the magnitude and direction of vertical exchange close to the bank. Pronounced changes in streambed temperature are observed down to a meter. When the river stage is high, which coincides with when the river is coldest, downward advection of heat from a previous cycles' warm-water pulse warms the streambed. When the river is at its lowest stage but warmest temperature, upwelling groundwater cools the streambed. Future research should consider and focus on a more thorough understanding of the impacts of dam regulation on the hydrologic, thermal, biogeochemical, and ecologic dynamics of rivers and their hyporheic and riparian zones.Show less"
21,"Pretty, JL",Oct 30 2006 ,Nutrient dynamics in relation to surface-subsurface hydrological exchange in a groundwater fed chalk stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Mini-piezometers were used to assess surface-subsurface hydrological exchange and biogeochemical processing in different patches on the river bed (coarse gravel, fine gravel/sand, silt/sand) at two sites on the River Lambourn (Berkshire, UK). Positive vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) dominated the riverbed, indicating potentially upwelling subsurface water. Hydraulic conductivity was highly variable in the shallow sediments, but was generally low at greater depths, suggesting that positive VHG may not translate to the rapid movement of subsurface water. Well defined areas of downwelling were not identified, although negative VHG did occur at the low/intermediate depths (similar to 10-20 cm). Furthermore, steep temperature gradients within the top 30 cm suggested that connectivity with the surface water was restricted to a shallow layer within the sediments.The three patch types differed in biogeochemical activity, largely as a function of their sediment size distribution, organic content and surface-subsurface exchange dynamics. Nitrate reduction was associated with hypoxic (< 90 mu M oxygen), organically rich silt/sand deposits and, at one site, with fine gravel/sand. Nitrate reduction was related to the depth of the silt/sand, and did not occur in the deep samples (> 30 cm) that contained oxygen > 90 mu M. A high background concentration of nitrous oxide (similar to 180 nM) occurred within the river bed, regardless of patch type and depth into the bed. In the nitrate reduction zone, N2O concentration was highly variable, with production and reduction of N2O. Ammonium concentration was higher within the river bed than in surface water and decreased with depth, particularly in the organically rich silt/sand and coarse gravels, where organic matter may get trapped.From a hydrological/biogeochemicat perspective, the Lambourn differs from many other rivers. Despite being hypernutrified (surface and subsurface nitrate > 400 mu M), the bed of the Lambourn is predominantly aerobic and does not serve as a significant nitrate sink. In addition, despite the permeable geology of the catchment, biogeochemical processing of nutrients may be restricted to the thin, but biologically productive, layer in the shallow river bed sediments.

22,"Sarremejane, R",Jun 2017 ,Habitat connectivity and dispersal ability drive the assembly mechanisms of macroinvertebrate communities in river networks,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Metacommunity studies commonly use spatial distances or, more recently, landscape resistance measures between study sites as a surrogate for connectivity. However, local communities are connected to many other sources of colonisation than the sites included in a study, and the availability and distance to potential colonisation sources may be better surrogates for dispersal than distances to other sampling sites. Here we test the effect of habitat connectivity on the assembly of stream-riffle macroinvertebrates with different dispersal abilities, after controlling for habitat heterogeneity and among-site distances (62km on average). We used a null model approach to compare observed community dissimilarity to random expectation. Significant deviations from randomness were expected due to the hierarchical structure of river networks with their increasing flux of organisms from headwaters to mainstem reaches. We found a gradual shift in dispersal-based processes driving assembly mechanisms, from dispersal limitation in the isolated headwater streams to randomness in connected headwater and isolated mid-order streams, and to mass effects in the most connected mid-order streams. Weak flyers were constrained by dispersal limitation in the most isolated sites, whereas strong flyers were not restricted by the river network structure and were mainly assembled through mass effects. The approach taken was sufficient to unravel the importance of dispersal and habitat connectivity on community assembly and may therefore be particularly well suited to other large data sets with isolated sites (i.e. low geographical density of sites).Show less"

This study focuses on streambed groundwater chemistry during a period of drought-induced river drying and consequent disconnection between surface water and groundwater. Shallow groundwater underlying vegetated and bare portions of a braided streambed in the Platte River (Nebraska, USA) was monitored during drought conditions in summer 2012. Water temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon (dominated by HCO3-) in streambed groundwater were correlated over a 3month period coinciding with a decline in river discharge from 35 to 0m(3)s(-1). Physical, chemical, and isotopic parameters were monitored to investigate mechanisms affecting the HCO3- trend. Equilibrium thermodynamic modeling suggests that an increase of pCO(2) near the water table, coupled with carbonate mineral weathering, can explain the trend. Stronger temporal trends in Ca2+ and Mg2+ compared to Cl- are consistent with carbonate mineral reequilibria rather than evaporative concentration as the primary mechanism of the increased HCO3-. Stable isotope trends are not apparent, providing further evidence of thermodynamic controls rather than evaporation from the water table. A combination of increased temperature and O-2 in the dewatered portion of the streambed is the most likely driver of increased pCO(2) near the water table. Results of this study highlight potential linkages between surface environmental changes and groundwater chemistry and underscore the need for high-resolution chemical monitoring of alluvial groundwater in order to identify environmental change impacts.Show less"
24,"Qi, JY",Dec 2021 ,Coupling terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes for improving stream temperature modeling at the watershed scale,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Water temperature is an important indicator of the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and influences numerous biological and chemical processes that affect water quality, the health and productivity of biota, and other ecosystem services. In this study, we improved the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of various terrestrial water components (i.e., surface runoff, lateral flow, and base flow) and the heat balance of water in streams. The improved SWAT model with an explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes (SWAT-HB) was compared with previous versions of the SWAT model that employ only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature (SWAT-ER) or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water (SWAT-EH) for the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Greensboro Watershed (GW) in the United States. The results show that, even though the SWAT-HB better simulates terrestrial thermal processes, all three models produce comparable simulations of long-term stream temperatures, indicating that stream temperature is mainly influenced by air temperature as water travels along large rivers. Nevertheless, the SWAT-HB and SWAT-EH models achieved better performance than the SWAT-ER model in the winter and spring but exhibited mixed performance in the summer and fall. The better model performance of the SWAT-HB model than the SWAT-EH model can be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperature components. Although, empirical methods (e.g., SWAT-ER) are suitable for providing estimation of stream temperature, the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance-based methods (e.g., SWAT-HB) allow for the consideration of land and water management practices (e.g. crop irrigation, land use change, and water use for thermoelectric cooling) effects on stream temperature.Show less"
25,"Pennington, R",Jun 2018 ,Measurement of gas-exchange rate in streams by the oxygen-carbon method,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The gas-exchange rate between streams and the atmosphere is needed to measure in-stream ecological processes and C processing in rivers and streams. Current methods include empirical relationships to hydraulics, direct injection of a tracer gas, and modeling based on O-2 or C diel curves. All existing methods have strengths and drawbacks and most are limited to point measurements or are unable to measure diel variation in exchange rate. Researchers continue to search for better techniques, particularly for steep streams with high rates of gas exchange and low primary productivity. We present the O-2-C (OC) method for calculating gas-exchange rates via simultaneous measurement of O-2 and dissolved inorganic C (DIC). Gas-exchange rates are calculated by solving the combined stream transport equation for O-2 and DIC. The output is a time-series of aeration rates at the same sampling frequency as the input O-2 and C data. Field tests in a 4th-order montane stream in Oregon, USA, indicate that the method is suitable for stream reaches with high downstream gas-concentration gradients and saturation deficits. The mean modeled aeration rate adjusted to 17 degrees C (3.25/h) agreed well with the value of 3.22/h from direct gas injection. Net ecosystem production calculated with the modeled aeration rate (-1.69 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) was consistent with the result obtained with direct gas injection (-1.60 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). An assumption of the model is a constant respiration quotient, but results indicated that the respiration quotient may be time variable. Sensitivity analysis indicated that application of the OC method is limited to reaches with a suitable change in combined O-2 and CO2 concentration >= similar to 4 mu mol/L and combined O-2 and CO2 saturation deficits approximate to 4 mu mol/L, characteristic of smaller gaining streams. Preliminary application of the OC method indicates it could be useful to practitioners interested in continuous measurement of gas-exchange rates.Show less"

This fMRI study addressed this question by quantifying regional multivariate representation and network organization underlying audiovisual speech-in-noise perception. Behaviorally, valid lip movements improved recognition of place of articulation to aid phoneme identification. Meanwhile, lip movements enhanced neural representations of phonemes in left auditory dorsal stream regions, including frontal speech motor areas and supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Moreover, neural representations of place of articulation and voicing features were promoted differentially by lip movements in these regions, with voicing enhanced in Broca's area while place of articulation better encoded in left ventral premotor cortex and SMG. Next, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis showed that such local changes were accompanied by strengthened effective connectivity along the dorsal stream. Moreover, the neurite orientation dispersion of the left arcuate fasciculus, the bearing skeleton of auditory dorsal stream, predicted the visual enhancements of neural representations and effective connectivity. Our findings provide novel insight to speech science that lip movements promote both local phonemic and feature encoding and network connectivity in the dorsal pathway and the functional enhancement is mediated by the microstructural architecture of the circuit.Show less"
27,"Whipple, AA",Jun 2019 ,Coupling landscapes and river flows to restore highly modified rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Modifications to landscapes and flow regimes of rivers have altered the function, biodiversity, and productivity of freshwater ecosystems globally. Reestablishing geomorphological and hydrological conditions necessary to sustain ecosystems is a central challenge for restoration within highly altered systems. Meeting this challenge requires simultaneously addressing multiple and interacting stressors within the context of irreversible changes and socio-economic constraints. Traditionally, river restoration approaches either physically change the landscape or channel (channel-floodplain manipulation) or adjust hydrology (environmental flows), and such actions are often independent. We juxtapose these two subfields of river restoration, which have undergone parallel transformations, from goals of reproducing static representations of form and flow regime to goals of reestablishing processes. The parallel transformations have generated shared ideas, which point to benefits of coupling channel-floodplain manipulation and environmental flow actions to achieve process-based goals. Such coupling supports comprehensive river restoration efforts aimed at supporting resilient ecosystems within human dominated landscapes in a nonstationary climate. We identify four elements of coupled approaches for restoring highly modified rivers: (1) identify physical and ecological process potential given interactive effects of altered landscapes and flows; (2) consider capacity for sustaining identified processes under potential future change; (3) model alternatives for coupled restoration actions to support identified processes; and (4) evaluate alternatives using metrics representing integrative effects of coupled actions. We suggest these emergent elements contribute to the development of standard practices for restoring highly modified rivers and encourage an increasing number and quality of coupled applications.Plain Language Summary Freshwater ecosystems globally have been fundamentally altered and degraded by multiple human modifications of rivers, which have affected the amount and timing of water availability as well as the riverine landscape with which river flows interact. Knowing that it is often impossible or infeasible to completely reverse these impacts, a central challenge for restoring freshwater ecosystems of highly modified rivers is to determine what water management changes and physical habitat restoration actions can be taken to reestablish processes necessary to support ecosystems. These different river restoration approaches have traditionally been considered independently of one another. However, both river restoration subfields have shifted in recent decades from goals of reproducing static representations of channel forms or reference flow regimes to those of reestablishing processes driven by flow-landscape interaction. This shared understanding points to the benefits of coupling channel-floodplain manipulation and water management for a combined added positive impact to ecosystems. Four elements of coupled approaches are identified: (1) identify process potential; (2) consider capacity under potential future change; (3) model alternatives; and (4) evaluate metrics of integrative effects. This commentary supports the development of standard practices for coupled approaches for restoring highly modified rivers.Show less"
28,"Fisher, SG",Jan-feb 1998 ,Material spiraling in stream corridors: A telescoping ecosystem model,ECOSYSTEMS,"Stream ecosystems consist of several subsystems that are spatially distributed concentrically, analogous to the elements of a simple telescope. Subsystems include the central surface stream, vertically and laterally arrayed saturated sediments (hyporheic and parafluvial zones), and the most distal element, the riparian zone. These zones are hydrologically connected; thus water and its dissolved and suspended load move through all of these subsystems as it flows downstream. In any given subsystem, chemical transformations result in a change in the quantity of materials in transport. Processing length is the length of subsystem required to ""process"" an amount of substrate equal to advective input. Long processing lengths reflect low rates of material cycling. Processing length provides the length dimension of each cylindrical element of the telescope and is specific to subsystem (for example, the surface stream), substrate (for instance, nitrate), and process (denitrification, for example). Disturbance causes processing length to increase. Processing length decreases during succession following disturbance. The whole stream-corridor ecosystem consists of several nested cylindrical elements that extend and retract, much as would a telescope, in response to disturbance regime. This telescoping ecosystem model (TEM) can improve understanding of material retention in running water systems; that is, their ""nutrient filtration"" capacity. We hypothesize that disturbance by flooding alters this capacity in proportion to both intensity of disturbance and to the relative effect of disturbance on each subsystem. We would expect more distal subsystems (for example, the riparian zone) to show the highest resistance to floods. fn contrast, we predict that postflood recovery of functions such as material processing (that is, resilience) will be highest in central elements and decrease laterally. Resistance and resilience of subsystems are thus both inversely correlated and spatially separated. We further hypothesize that cross-linkages between adjacent subsystems will enhance resilience of the system as a whole. Whole-ecosystem retention transformation, and transport are thus viewed as a function of subsystem extent, lateral and vertical linkage, and disturbance regime.Show less"
29,"Harvey, JW",Oct 9 2012 ,Hydrogeomorphology of the hyporheic zone: Stream solute and fine particle interactions with a dynamic streambed,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Hyporheic flow in streams has typically been studied separately from geomorphic processes. We investigated interactions between bed mobility and dynamic hyporheic storage of solutes and fine particles in a sand-bed stream before, during, and after a flood. A conservatively transported solute tracer (bromide) and a fine particles tracer (5 mu m latex particles), a surrogate for fine particulate organic matter, were co-injected during base flow. The tracers were differentially stored, with fine particles penetrating more shallowly in hyporheic flow and retained more efficiently due to the high rate of particle filtration in bed sediment compared to solute. Tracer injections lasted 3.5 h after which we released a small flood from an upstream dam one hour later. Due to shallower storage in the bed, fine particles were rapidly entrained during the rising limb of the flood hydrograph. Rather than being flushed by the flood, we observed that solutes were stored longer due to expansion of hyporheic flow paths beneath the temporarily enlarged bedforms. Three important timescales determined the fate of solutes and fine particles: (1) flood duration, (2) relaxation time of flood-enlarged bedforms back to base flow dimensions, and (3) resulting adjustments and lag times of hyporheic flow. Recurrent transitions between these timescales explain why we observed a peak accumulation of natural particulate organic matter between 2 and 4 cm deep in the bed, i.e., below the scour layer of mobile bedforms but above the maximum depth of particle filtration in hyporheic flow paths. Thus, physical interactions between bed mobility and hyporheic transport influence how organic matter is stored in the bed and how long it is retained, which affects decomposition rate and metabolism of this southeastern Coastal Plain stream. In summary we found that dynamic interactions between hyporheic flow, bed mobility, and flow variation had strong but differential influences on base flow retention and flood mobilization of solutes and fine particulates. These hydrogeomorphic relationships have implications for microbial respiration of organic matter, carbon and nutrient cycling, and fate of contaminants in streams.Show less"
30,"Su, XR",Nov 2020 ,Scale issues and the effects of heterogeneity on the dune-induced hyporheic mixing,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hyporheic mixing plays a vital role in physical, biogeochemical, and thermal processes in river networks. While many studies have emphasized the role of streambed heterogeneity in hyporheic mixing processes, this study articulates the scale issues inherent in concentration, mixing, heterogeneity, and modeling approaches. It subsequently conducted simulations of hyporheic mixing in synthetic, heterogeneous, 2-D cross-sectional river beds based on prescribed hydraulic conductivity defined at the local-scale. It then investigated the flux variation distribution and the mixing zone under different degrees of heterogeneity and flow scenarios. Since the characterization of the heterogeneities in detail at the local scale is practically impossible, Monte Carlo simulation based on stochastic theory was used to demonstrate the hyporheic mixing under the large-scale control volume (macromixing). Afterward, a first-order stochastic analysis was undertaken to explore the relationship between local-scale flux variance distribution and the mixing zone under different heterogeneity and flow scenarios. The results of this study show that the flux variance in the streambed is an appropriate metric for assessing the magnitude of hyporheic mixing at all scales. Further, surface water velocity and upwelling groundwater are found to be the dominant controlling factors of the flux variance and in turn, the mixing process, followed by the streambed heterogeneity. In addition, it demonstrates that the hyporheic mixing process is significantly affected by the complex surface and groundwater circulation regimes and the stagnation zone under steady-state flow conditions.Show less"

Here, we compared the strengths of intracranial functional connectivity between two main hubs of the dorsal stream, namely the left auditory-related cortex (ARC) and Broca's region, in a sample of simultaneous interpreters (Sls) and multilingual control subjects while the participants performed a mixed and unmixed auditory semantic decision task. Under normal listening conditions such kind of tasks are known to initiate a spread of activation along the ventral stream. However, due to extensive and specific training, here we predicted that Sls will more strongly recruit the dorsal pathway in order to pre-activate the speech codes of the corresponding translation. In line with this reasoning, EEG results demonstrate increased left-hemispheric theta phase synchronization in SLI compared to multilingual control participants during early task-related processing stages. In addition, within the SI group functional connectivity strength in the left dorsal pathway was positively related to the cumulative number of training hours across lifespan, and inversely correlated with the age of training commencement. Hence, we propose that the alignment of neuronal oscillations between brain regions involved in ""hearing"" and ""speaking"" results from an intertwining of training, sensitive period, and predisposition.Show less"
32,"Smidt, SJ",Nov-dec 2015 ,A Comparison of Hyporheic Transport at a Cross-Vane Structure and Natural Riffle,GROUNDWATER,"While restoring hyporheic flowpaths has been cited as a benefit to stream restoration structures, little documentation exists confirming that constructed restoration structures induce comparable hyporheic exchange to natural stream features. This study compares a stream restoration structure (cross-vane) to a natural feature (riffle) concurrently in the same stream reach using time-lapsed electrical resistivity (ER) tomography. Using this hydrogeophysical approach, we were able to quantify hyporheic extent and transport beneath the cross-vane structure and the riffle. We interpret from the geophysical data that the cross-vane and the natural riffle induced spatially and temporally unique hyporheic extent and transport, and the cross-vane created both spatially larger and temporally longer hyporheic flowpaths than the natural riffle. Tracer from the 4.67-h injection was detected along flowpaths for 4.6 h at the cross-vane and 4.2 h at the riffle. The spatial extent of the hyporheic zone at the cross-vane was 12% larger than that at the riffle. We compare ER results of this study to vertical fluxes calculated from temperature profiles and conclude significant differences in the interpretation of hyporheic transport from these different field techniques. Results of this study demonstrate a high degree of heterogeneity in transport metrics at both the cross-vane and the riffle and differences between the hyporheic flowpath networks at the two different features. Our results suggest that restoration structures may be capable of creating sufficient exchange flux and timescales of transport to achieve the same ecological functions as natural features, but engineering of the physical and biogeochemical environment may be necessary to realize these benefits.Show less"
33,"Sawyer, AH",Jun 2014 ,Hydrologic dynamics and geochemical responses within a floodplain aquifer and hyporheic zone during Hurricane Sandy,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Storms dominate solute export budgets from catchments and drive hydrogeochemical changes in the near-stream environment. We captured near-stream hydrogeochemical dynamics during an intense storm (Hurricane Sandy, October 2012), by instrumenting a riparian-hyporheic zone transect of White Clay Creek in the Christina River Basin Critical Zone Observatory with pressure transducers, redox probes, and pore water samplers. In the floodplain aquifer, preferential vertical flow paths such as macropores facilitated rapid infiltration early in the storm. Water table rose quickly and promoted continuous groundwater discharge to the stream. Floodplain-hillslope topography controlled poststorm aquifer drainage rates, as the broad, western floodplain aquifer drained more slowly than the narrow, eastern floodplain aquifer adjacent to a steep hillslope. These changes in groundwater flow drove heterogeneous geochemical responses in the floodplain aquifer and hyporheic zone. Vertical infiltration in the floodplain and hyporheic exchange in the streambed increased DOC and oxygen delivery to microbially active sediments, which may have enhanced respiration. Resulting geochemical perturbations persisted from days to weeks after the storm. Our observations suggest that groundwater-borne solute delivery to streams during storms depends on unique interactions of vertical infiltration along preferential pathways, perturbations to groundwater geochemistry, and topographically controlled drainage rates.Show less"
34,"Leslie, DL",Aug 15 2017 ,"A temporal stable isotopic (delta O-18, delta D, d-excess) comparison in glacier meltwater streams, Taylor Valley, Antarctica",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In this paper, we describe the importance of hyporheic dynamics within Andersen Creek and Von Guerard Stream, Taylor Valley, Antarctica, from the 2010-2011 melt season using natural tracers. Water collection started at flow onset and continued, with weekly hyporheic-zone sampling. The water delta O-18 and delta D values were isotopically lighter in the beginning and heavier later in the season. D-excess measurements were used as an indicator of mixing because an evaporative signature was evident and distinguishable between 2 primary end-members (glacier meltwater and hyporheic zone). Hyporheic-zone influence on the channel water was variable with a strong control on streamwater chemistry, except at highest discharges. This work supports previous research indicating that Von Guerard Stream has a large, widespread hyporheic zone that varies in size with time and discharge. Andersen Creek, with a smaller hyporheic zone, displayed hyporheic-zone solute interaction through the influence from subsurface hypersaline flow. Overall, the evolution of Taylor Valley hyporheic-zone hydrology is described seasonally. In mid-December, the hyporheic zone is a dynamic system exchanging with the glacier meltwater in the channel, and with diminishing flow in January, the hyporheic zone drains back into the channel flow also impacting stream chemistry. This work adds new information on the role of hyporheic zone-stream interaction in these glacier meltwater streams.Show less"

We show that the hydraulic conductivity of shallow alluvial aquifers subject to sinuosity-driven hyporheic flow is dynamic because of transport of fine materials. We analyze changes in hydraulic conductivity over one year at a meander-scale experimental river-aquifer system using water table monitoring, repeat in-situ hydraulic tests, grain size analysis, and flow modeling with particle tracking. Areas with relatively high initial hydraulic conductivity became more permeable after one year, while areas with lower initial hydraulic conductivity became less permeable. Particle tracking suggests fine materials were flushed from the more permeable portions of the aquifer and deposited in the less permeable areas down-gradient. Since hydraulic conductivity evolution has feedback on flow, static or synoptic hydraulic conductivity measurements in river-hyporheic-riparian systems may need to be revisited. Temporally changing hydraulic conductivity has the capacity to impact rates of ecological and biogeochemical processes. Citation: Nowinski, J. D., M. B. Cardenas, and A. F.

36,"Leach, JA",Jun 2021 ,Lake Outflow and Hillslope Lateral Inflows Dictate Thermal Regimes of Forested Streams Draining Small Lakes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Empirical studies have highlighted the important influence of lakes on stream temperature at landscape scales, even when lakes comprise just a small fraction of the catchment area. However, only a few studies have focused on the hydrologic and thermal processes underpinning these landscape patterns. We collected detailed field measurements at a boreal stream that drains a headwater lake and used these data within a process-based stream temperature model to, (a) document the downstream extent of lake influences at both seasonal and event-based timescales, (b) assess the hydrologic and thermal processes that control the observed downstream variability, and (c) compare downstream temperature for streams with and without a headwater lake. Summer and autumn lake outlet temperatures were elevated compared to hillslope lateral inflow temperatures. During periods of low lake outflow, stream temperatures decreased rapidly downstream as local energy fluxes, primarily lateral inflows from the hillslopes and hyporheic exchange, overwhelmed the lake effects. The lake influence on downstream temperature was the greatest during periods of high lake outflow and persisted at least 1.4 km downstream. Since lakes can moderate and delay upstream rainfall runoff response, periods of high lake outflow and high hillslope inflow rates were generally out-of-phase. This difference in timing of warm lake outlet and cool hillslope water creates a dynamic thermal environment downstream of the small lake. Such lakes are ubiquitous in northern landscapes, and accounting for the competing influence of lake and hillslope contributions on downstream water temperature is critical for predicting how network-scale thermal regimes will respond to environmental change.Show less"
37,"Malard, F",Jul 2001 ,Thermal heterogeneity in the hyporheic zone of a glacial floodplain,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"We examined the thermal regime of surface and hyporheic waters at three kryal sites and four krenal streams within the channel network of a glacial floodplain. Temperature was continuously measured for 1 year in the surface stream and at sediment depths of 30 and 80 cm. The vertical pattern of water temperature was strongly influenced by the direction and intensity of surface water - groundwater exchanges. At sites characterized by strong downwelling of surface waters, the thermal regimes of surface and hyporheic waters were virtually identical. In contrast, inputs of groundwater substantially increased mean summer temperatures in the hyporheic zone of the main kryal channel, decreased summer temperatures in the hyporheic zone of krenal streams, and elevated hyporheic temperatures of all stream types during winter. Groundwater from different sources had dramatically different effects on the seasonal regime of temperature in the hyporheic zone. Inflow of shallow alluvial groundwater had minimal effects on seasonal patterns of hyporheic temperature, whereas upwelling from deep alluvial and hillslope aquifers resulted in significant time lags and differences in seasonal amplitudes between surface and hyporheic temperatures. The unexpectedly high thermal heterogeneity of hyporheic waters presumably sustains biodiversity and stimulates ecosystem processes in this glacial floodplain.Show less"
38,"Houze, C",Feb 2022 ,Combining experimental and modelling approaches to monitor the transport of an artificial tracer through the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In order to advance methodologies used in the investigation of Hyporheic Zone (HZ) mixing processes, this article combines experimental and modelling tools to follow a tracer injected into the river and infiltrating into the HZ. A highly concentrated sodium chloride solution was injected into the river; (i) the river conductivity, (ii) the riverbed resistivity by Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and (iii) vertically distributed chloride concentrations within the HZ were monitored. Both ERT and concentration measurements showed an infiltration depth of the tracer of 35 cm, and a partial recovery after injection, which was faster within the superficial layer that was found to be more resistive according to the ERT initial image. The modelling approach used the HydroGeoSphere code to model the coupling between river surface flows and HZ groundwater flows and transport processes. The model set-up involved a 50 cm high existing riverbed step, a vertical contrast in HZ saturated hydraulic conductivity and the aquifer discharge flux. Fitting the vertical chloride profile, the adjusted values were 5 x 10(-2) m s(-1) for the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the first highly permeable layer below the riverbed, and 4 x 10(-6) m s(-1) for the aquifer discharge flux. The bottom layer saturated hydraulic conductivity was found to be at least 10 times lower than the value within the first layer. Numerical simulations showed that the two main parameters controlling the mixing within the HZ were the groundwater discharge and the saturated hydraulic conductivity first sediment layer of the riverbed. The riverbed step was found to be less significant here compared to these two parameters. The combination of experimental and modelling tools allowed us to quantify the aquifer discharge flux, which is complicated to investigate in the field without any model. Results of this study showed that combining modelling with ERT and vertically distributed chloride sampling allows the quantification of the main factors controlling the hyporheic exchange.Show less"

Efforts have been made to assess connectivity between wetlands and streams and possible management implications by comparing existing wetland and stream maps (e.g., National Hydrography Dataset [NHD]) but the reliability of these assessments is affected by the accuracy and inherent nature of input datasets. Stream datasets derived using semi-automated and automated interpretation of LiDAR derived digital elevation models were found to be considerably more accurate than NHD High Resolution (12% less accurate than automatically generated streams) and Plus (29% less accurate than automatically generated streams) and in general use of LiDAR derived datasets was found to significantly increase percent area and total number of wetlands that were considered connected at multiple buffer lengths ranging from 0 to 80 m. When wetland-stream connectivity as judged using NHD was compared to a semi-automatically generated highly accurate LiDAR derived stream dataset, the High Resolution NHD was found to underestimate semi-natural palustrine wetland area connected by 15% and number of wetlands connected by 13% on average while NHD Plus was found to underestimate semi-natural palustrine wetland area and number connected by 27% on average.Show less"
40,"Hussein, M",Aug 2003 ,Modeling of flow and contaminant transport in coupled stream-aquifer systems,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,"This paper describes an integrated approach for modeling flow and contaminant transport in hydraulically connected stream-aquifer systems. The code, FTSTREAM, extended the capabilities of the ground-water model, FTWORK, to incorporate chemical fate and transport in streams. Flow in the stream network is modeled as an unsteady, spatially varying flow, while transport modeling is based on a one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation. In addition to sorption and decay during transport in ground water, the model incorporates volatilization, settling and decay during transport in surface water. The interaction between surface water and ground water is accommodated by a leakage term and is implemented in the model using an iterative Picard-type procedure to ensure mass conservation across the interface between the two systems.The modeling approach is used to simulate contaminant transport in the Mad River, Ohio, which is hydraulically connected to a buried valley aquifer of sand and gravel outwash. The river is a receiving stream in the upstream part of the modeled area. Downstream, heavy pumping from a municipal well field causes the river to become a loosing stream. Induced infiltration from the river is responsible for a considerable portion of the well yield. The flow and transport model, developed for this study, simulates coupling between flow in the aquifer and the river. Hypothetical sources of contamination are introduced at selected locations in the upstream portion of the aquifer. The model is then used to simulate the expected transport in both the aquifer and the stream. A series of simulations elucidates the role of the river in facilitating the transport of the hypothetical contaminants in ground water and surface water. Effect of sorption, retardation and volatilization on contaminant transport is also examined for the case of the volatile organic compounds. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.Show less"

Severe or extreme droughts occurred about 10% of the time over a 105-year record from central New Mexico, U.S.A., based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index.2. Drought lowers water tables, creating extensive areas of groundwater recharge and fragmenting reaches of streams and rivers. Deeper groundwater inputs predominate as sources of surface flows during drought. Nutrient inputs to streams and rivers reflect the biogeochemistry of regional ground waters with longer subsurface residence times.3. Inputs of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon to surface waters decrease during drought, with labile carbon limitation of microbial metabolism a byproduct of drought conditions.4. Decreased inputs of organic forms of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and a decrease in the organic : inorganic ratio of nutrient inputs favours autotrophs over heterotrophs during drought.5. The fate of autotrophic production during drought will be strongly influenced by the structure of the aquatic food web within impacted sites.Show less"
43,"Leathwick, JR",Jan 2011 ,Use of generalised dissimilarity modelling to improve the biological discrimination of river and stream classifications,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"P>1. Classifications that group rivers and streams with similar ecological characteristics are used increasingly to underpin conservation and resource management planning. Uses include identifying systems that may respond similarly to human activities or management actions, setting guidelines and standards to manage human impacts, interpreting data from inventory (survey) and monitoring, and identifying priority sites for conservation management.2. Traditional approaches to river classification have been based mostly on delineating landscape units (ecoregions), often by grouping adjacent catchments having similar ecological character. However, use of this approach can be complicated by marked local heterogeneity of river systems. Instead, classifications may be more ecologically relevant if individual river or stream segments having similar environmental conditions are grouped together, independent of their geographic locations. The latter approach also allows the use of more rigorous classification procedures, including newly emerging techniques that optimise the ability of a classification to discriminate patterns in parallel sets of biological data.3. Here, we explore the use of one of these newer techniques, generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM), an extension of generalised regression techniques, that defines an optimal set of transformations of candidate environmental predictors to maximise explanation of species turnover in site-based biological data.4. Using two biological data sets describing the distributions of freshwater fish and macroinvertebrates and a candidate set of functionally relevant environmental variables, we used GDM to identify the variables, weightings and transformations that best explain biological dissimilarities across sites. We then used these as input to a multivariate classification of 567 000 river and stream segments throughout New Zealand. Weightings and transformations of these variables were also specified from the GDM analysis. The matrix of transformed environmental predictors was classified in a two-stage process, using non-hierarchical mediod clustering to define an initial set of 400 groups, with relationships between these groups then defined using hierarchical clustering.5. The resulting classification better discriminates sites with similar biological character than previous classifications, particularly at higher levels of classification detail. Key factors contributing to this success include the use of detailed, segment-specific environmental variables, coherently accounting for the longitudinal connectivity inherent in rivers including its implications for the construction of biologically relevant predictors, and the use of a modelling technique (GDM) designed to specifically analyse biological turnover and its relationships with environment.Show less"
44,"Yu, ZH",Feb 2022 ,Dynamic impacts of changes in river structure and connectivity on water quality under urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta plain,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The deterioration of river water quality in urbanized areas is getting more serious, and affects the regional ecology and development of social economy; however, its mechanisms of dynamic variation is still an open question. In this study, we detected the dynamics of water quality and its driven mechanisms in the Yangtze River Delta plain, one of the most developed areas in China. The results showed that the spatial agglomerations of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP) presented seasonal differences, which exhibited a trend of shifting from west to east and then to west from spring to winter. Further, the relative contribution rates of the river network characteristics affecting water quality were quantified on the basis of backpropagation artificial neural networks. We found that the average contribution rates of river structure (more than 60%) were higher than that of river connectivity, and the dominant factors influencing water quality were water surface ratio (W-P) and multifractal indices (Delta a, Delta f). Specifically, the average relative contribution rates of W-P, Delta a and Delta f were 18.72%, 15.03%, and 14.52% during the flood season, respectively, and 15.83%, 16.58%, and 14.54% during the non-flood season. The functional connectivity influenced by obstruction of sluices also influences water quality, which accounting for 11.15% and 12.85% in the flood and non-flood seasons, respectively.Show less"
45,"Baki, ABM",Mar 2012 ,"The hydrological characteristics of a stream within an integrated framework of lake-stream connectivity in the Lac de Gras Watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,"Lake-stream networks dominate much of northern Canada. This study explores the hydrological characteristics of an outlet stream from a headwater lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Flow hydrographs indicated that stream flow was maximal in most of the cross sections during the first week of July, and subsequently declined to zero by the first week of August 2009 and last week of August 2010. Water balance analysis indicated that the lake can be recharged by runoff from the catchment, but summer evaporation, combined with groundwater loss, caused draw down of lake level below the outflow threshold. Summer rainfall in this semi-arid environment was insufficient to overcome storage deficits to re-establish flow connectivity between lakes. The suitability of the stream sections were assessed for small and large young-of-the-year Arctic grayling based on stream geometry, stream flow characteristics, stream water temperature, and stream water quality.Show less"
46,"Arnon, S",Jan 1 2010 ,"Effects of overlying velocity, particle size, and biofilm growth on stream-subsurface exchange of particles",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream-subsurface exchange strongly influences the transport of contaminants, fine particles, and other ecologically relevant substances in streams. We used a recirculating laboratory flume (220 cm long and 20 cm wide) to study the effects of particle size, overlying velocity, and biofilm formation on stream-subsurface exchange of particles. Sodium chloride was used as a non-reactive dissolved tracer and 1- and 5-mu m fluorescent microspheres were used as particulate tracers. Surface-subsurface exchange was observed with a clean sand bed and a bed colonized by an autotrophic-heterotrophic biofilm under two different overlying velocities, 0.9 and 5 cm s(-1). Hydrodynamic interactions between the overlying flow and sand bed resulted in a reduction of solute and particle concentrations in the water column, and a corresponding accumulation of particles in both the sediments and in the biofilm. Increasing overlying velocity and particle size resulted in faster removal from the overlying water due to enhanced mass transfer to the bed. The presence of the biofilm did not affect solute exchange under any flow condition tested. The presence of the biofilm significantly increased the deposition of particles under an overlying velocity of 5 cm s(-1), and produced a small but statistically insignificant increase at 0.9 cm(-1). The particles preferentially deposited within the biofilm matrix relative to the underlying sand. These results demonstrate that hydrodynamic transport conditions, particle size, and biofilm formation play a key role in the transport of suspended particles, such as inorganic sediments, particulate organic matter, and pathogenic microorganisms in freshwater ecosystems, and should be taken into consideration when predicting the fate and transport of particles and contaminants in the environment.

47,"Qiu, H",Feb 2019 ,Evaluating a Coupled Phenology-Surface Energy Balance Model to Understand Stream-Subsurface Temperature Dynamics in a Mixed-Use Farmland Catchment,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream temperature is a key variable that controls both physical and biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. Complex physical interactions between land surface and subsurface processes make accurate simulations of stream temperature dynamics at catchment scales a challenging task. In this study we propose an integrated, catchment-scale framework to model stream, soil, streambed, and groundwater temperatures under the influence of hydrologic and vegetation dynamics in a mixed land use catchment in central England. The phenology and surface energy modules in the coupled model were used to quantify the impacts of vegetation processes on radiation fluxes (e.g., canopy shading and the effect of vegetation growth on optical parameters). The model enabled accurate simulations of the movement and partitioning of water and thermal fluxes in different hydrologic domains with R-2 values of observed and simulated temperatures in the range 0.60-0.87. Simulated groundwater heads and stream stages allowed the identification of gaining and losing portions of stream reaches and the estimation of Darcy fluxes. Simulation results show significantly dampened diel streambed temperature fluctuations below 0.3m in gaining reaches, while in losing reaches the diel fluctuations showed relatively strong fluctuations below 0.3m. The model enabled evaluation of the relative contributions of different processes to the stream thermal budget. Results indicate that net radiation was the dominant heat source, while latent heat flux was the primary heat sink. The model provides a useful tool to explicitly simulate water and heat fluxes as well as temperature-dependent reaction rates in biogeochemical analyses.Show less"
48,"Stead, TK",Jun 2004 ,The contribution of subsurface invertebrates to benthic density and biomass in a gravel stream,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"The interstitial sediments of streams and rivers, the 'hyporheic zone', have a diverse and numerous fauna though the relative contribution of the subsurface and surface assemblages to total productivity remains poorly understood. Our main aim was to determine the contribution of hyporheic invertebrates to overall, reach-scale estimates of density and biomass in an acidic, first order stream in south-east England. We estimated metazoan density across a wide range of body sizes (meiofauna [>42mum to <500mum] and macrofauna [>500mum]) over time. A comparison with the assemblage from the streambed surface indicated that surface samples (0 - 5 cm) alone potentially underestimate annual, reach-scale estimates of density and biomass by factors of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively. An invertebrate assemblage of relatively few, large individuals near the surface was replaced by a suite of numerous but small-bodied organisms in the deeper sediments. Although abundances peaked at different depths in the sediments, most taxa were found throughout the profile. The assemblage of numerous, small-bodied invertebrates in the interstices at this stream may contribute substantially towards overall benthic production.Show less"
49,"Garner, G",Mar 15 2015 ,"Inter-annual variability in the effects of riparian woodland on micro-climate, energy exchanges and water temperature of an upland Scottish stream",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The influence of riparian woodland on stream temperature, micro-climate and energy exchange was investigated over seven calendar years. Continuous data were collected from two reaches of the Girnock Burn (a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland) with contrasting land use characteristics: (1) semi-natural riparian forest and (2) open moorland. In the moorland reach, wind speed and energy fluxes (especially net radiation, latent heat and sensible heat) varied considerably between years because of variable riparian micro-climate coupled strongly to prevailing meteorological conditions. In the forested reach, riparian vegetation sheltered the stream from meteorological conditions that produced a moderated micro-climate and thus energy exchange conditions, which were relatively stable between years. Net energy gains (losses) in spring and summer (autumn and winter) were typically greater in the moorland than the forest. However, when particularly high latent heat loss or low net radiation gain occurred in the moorland, net energy gain (loss) was less than that in the forest during the spring and summer (autumn and winter) months. Spring and summer water temperature was typically cooler in the forest and characterised by less inter-annual variability due to reduced, more inter-annually stable energy gain in the forested reach. The effect of riparian vegetation on autumn and winter water temperature dynamics was less clear because of the confounding effects of reach-scale inflows of thermally stable groundwater in the moorland reach, which strongly influenced the local heat budget. These findings provide new insights as to the hydrometeorological conditions under which semi-natural riparian forest may be effective in mitigating river thermal variability, notably peaks, under present and future climates.
