0,"Ward, JV",Nov-dec 2001 ,Understanding natural patterns and processes in river corridors as the basis for effective river restoration,REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT,"Running water ecology is a young science, the conceptual foundations of which were derived largely from research conducted in Europe and North America. However, virtually all European river corridors were substantially regulated well before the science of river ecology developed. While regulation of North American river systems occurred later than in European systems, river ecology also developed later. Therefore, there is a general impression of rivers as being much less heterogeneous and much more stable than they actually are in the natural state. The thesis of this paper is that established research and management concepts may fail to fully recognize the crucial roles of habitat heterogeneity and fluvial dynamics owing to a lack of fundamental knowledge of the structural and functional features of morphologically intact river corridors. Until quite recently, most concepts in river ecology were based on the implicit assumption that rivers are stable, single-thread channels isolated from adjacent floodplains. Unfortunately, many rivers are in just such a state, but it should be recognized that this is not the natural condition. This incomplete understanding constrains scientific advances in river ecology and renders management and restoration initiatives less effective. Examples are given of the high level of spatio-temporal heterogeneity that may be attained in rivers where natural processes still operate on a large scale. The objective of this paper is to promulgate a broader and more integrative understanding of natural processes in river corridors as a necessary prelude to effective river conservation and management.

1,"Ng, GHC",Sep 2017 ,Modeling hydrologic controls on sulfur processes in sulfate-impacted wetland and stream sediments,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Recent studies show sulfur redox processes in terrestrial settings are more important than previously considered, but much remains uncertain about how these processes respond to dynamic hydrologic conditions in natural field settings. We used field observations from a sulfate-impacted wetland and stream in the mining region of Minnesota (USA) to calibrate a reactive transport model and evaluate sulfur and coupled geochemical processes under contrasting hydrogeochemical scenarios. Simulations of different hydrological conditions showed that flux and chemistry differences between surface water and deeper groundwater strongly control hyporheic zone geochemical profiles. However, model results for the stream channel versus wetlands indicate sediment organic carbon content to be the more important driver of sulfate reduction rates. A complex nonlinear relationship between sulfate reduction rates and geochemical conditions is apparent from the model's higher sensitivity to sulfate concentrations in settings with higher organic content. Across all scenarios, simulated e(-) balance results unexpectedly showed that sulfate reduction dominates iron reduction, which is contrary to the traditional thermodynamic ladder but corroborates recent experimental findings by Hansel et al. (2015) that cryptic sulfur cycling could drive sulfate reduction in preference over iron reduction. Following the thermodynamic ladder, our models shows that high surface water sulfate slows methanogenesis in shallow sediments, but field observations suggest that sulfate reduction may not entirely suppress methane. Overall, our results show that sulfate reduction may serve as a major component making up and influencing terrestrial redox processes, with dynamic hyporheic fluxes controlling sulfate concentrations and reaction rates, especially in high organic content settings.Plain Language Summary Unlike in oceans, sulfur reactions have not been considered to play a prominent role in the biogeochemistry of terrestrial environments because of much lower concentrations, but recent studies have been showing terrestrial sulfur reactions to be more important than previously thought. These reactions often take place in wetland, stream, and lake sediments, which can contain a mix of both surface water and underlying groundwater. Our study investigated how water fluxes through these sediments can affect sulfur reactions when the surface water and groundwater chemistry differ significantly, such as through influxes of surface water sulfur from mining activities. Using field measurements and a computer model that simulates chemical reactions and water flow, we found that water flux drives water chemistry in wetland and stream sediments. This affects how rapidly sulfur reactions occur, especially in organic-rich wetland sediments. The model showed sulfur reactions to dominate over iron reactions, which contradicts classic chemical thermodynamics. Also, when water fluxes carry high sulfur concentrations into wetland sediments, sulfur reactions out compete production of methane, a strong greenhouse gas. Our results indicate that sulfur reactions can play a prominent role in terrestrial biogeochemistry, and the degree to which it does is affected by hydrological fluxes.Show less"
2,"Gao, S",Sep 2021 ,Mapping dynamic non-perennial stream networks using high-resolution distributed hydrologic simulation: A case study in the upper blue river basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"More than half of all streams globally are non-perennial, and thus dynamic due to their expanding and retracting nature. Field mapping in conjunction with observational data from gauges and/or in-situ loggers is a typical approach for studying non-perennial stream dynamics, but these approaches underrepresent their spatiotemporal variability. High-resolution distributed hydrological modeling promises to bridge this gap, thanks to advances in model physics, remote sensing, and computational power. As the first step towards this goal, we investigate the capability of distributed hydrologic modeling to capture stream dynamics in Upper Blue River Basin, OK. Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST), a distributed hydrological model, is used to simulate spatiotemporally varied streamflow at 10-meter spatial resolution and daily time steps. USGS stream gauge data and insitu state logger data are used to calibrate and validate the simulation at the watershed outlet and small headwater tributaries, respectively. Dynamic Surface Water Estimate (DSWE), a LANDSAT product is also compared with simulated water presence in high-order streams. Results show that the CREST model can capture low-moderate streamflow values at the watershed outlet with a log-NSE value over 0.7 in the validation period, while underestimating high flow values due to the daily time step. Also, the calibrated model can accurately estimate wet/dry status as monitored by in-situ state loggers in nine headwater catchments. The dynamic stream networks are mapped over 2510 stream segments using the CREST simulation. Non-perennial streams are the most dynamic in small headwater tributaries (contributing area <2 km(2)) and high-order streams are sustained by perennial flow. As hydrologic interpretation of the stream dynamics, the interannual and seasonal variability in rainfall and evapotranspiration is well reflected by the water occurrence in streams. Across various catchments, a consistent threshold behavior is found between drainage density and unit discharge, indicating the control of runoff generation on the flowing stream networks. The mapping also identifies differences in stream dynamics caused by heterogeneities in land cover and soil properties. Given the prevalence of dynamical streams worldwide, our analysis illustrates the potential for mapping them using distributed hydrologic models.Show less"
3,"Ochs, CA",Sep 2019 ,Fluxes of nutrients and primary production between the main channel and floodplain backwaters of the Lower Mississippi River-Development of a simulation model,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Connection between rivers and their floodplain is critical to the function of fluvial systems; however, there has been little research quantitatively examining the dynamics of this interaction for large, alluvial rivers. Critical questions include the following: What are the rates and mechanisms of materials and energy exchange, and in what ways does the exchange impact ecosystem functioning? To address these questions, we built a simple model of a hypothetical reach of the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) containing a single backwater. The model is based on empirical data obtained from the LMR system. Our primary objectives for the model were to assess potential backwater impacts on river nitrate transport and in subsidizing phytoplankton biomass to the main channel. Simulations run over a 10-year period suggest that on an annual basis, (a) LMR backwaters remove NO3-N, and it would require a temporal mean of 34,400 ha functioning like the model backwater, or 2.8 times the current area of oxbow lakes, to eliminate 100% of the river flux of NO3-N of our study region; (b) it would require inputs of phytoplankton from a mean of 5,242 ha of sites functioning like the model backwater to produce observed river flux of phytoplankton biomass; and (c) backwater function is sensitive to the controlling elevation in linking channels hence subject to management. Although simple, this model is a useful first step in quantifying the significance of river-backwater connectivity on ecological processes of the LMR system.Show less"
4,"Nitti, M",Sep 2012 ,Multimedia streaming in Multi-Homed Hybrid Ad Hoc Networks: A model of network connectivity,SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION,"In this paper we consider the scenario of a Multi-Homed Hybrid Ad Hoc Network, which consists of self-organized and self-configured mobile nodes that make use of two or more fixed gateways to connect to the Internet. Accordingly, different network segments are formed, each one associated with a different gateway. A node can maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from a network to another by performing handover procedures and changing its gateway to the Internet. This scenario is quite interesting for its capacity of increasing the geographical extension of a single mobile network. Within this scenario we focus on the modelling of the node connectivity, which is of practical interest for the design of rate control algorithms for multimedia streaming systems. We consider a network structure with gateways placed in a honey cell structure, where nodes move according to the RDMM (Random Direction Mobility Model). We then derive the probabilities for a node to change the route to connect to the Internet and to handover from a network to another, which both cause service interruptions that heavily affect the quality in multimedia streaming services. Numerical results show the accuracy of the proposed theoretical model with respect to simulated data and reveal the benefits of the model in controlling playback buffer starvation occurrences during video streaming.

5,"Malzone, JM",Jul 2016 ,Response of the hyporheic zone to transient groundwater fluctuations on the annual and storm event time scales,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The volume of the water stored in and exchanged with the hyporheic zone is an important factor in stream metabolism and biogeochemical cycling. Previous studies have identified groundwater direction and magnitude as one key control on the volume of the hyporheic zone, suggesting that fluctuation in the riparian water table could induce large changes under certain seasonal conditions. In this study, we analyze the transient drivers that control the volume of the hyporheic zone by coupling the Brinkman-Darcy equation to the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate annual and storm induced groundwater fluctuations. The expansion and contraction of the hyporheic zone was quantified based on temporally dynamic scenarios simulating annual groundwater fluctuations in a humid temperate climate. The amplitude of the groundwater signal was varied between scenarios to represent a range of annual hydrologic forcing. Storm scenarios were then superimposed on the annual scenario to simulate the response to short-term storm signals. Simulations used two different groundwater storm responses; one in-phase with the surface water response and one 14 h out-of-phase with the surface water response to represent our observed site conditions. Results show that annual groundwater fluctuation is a dominant control on the volume of the hyporheic zone, where increasing groundwater fluctuation increases the amount of annual variation. Storm responses depended on the antecedent conditions determined by annual scenarios, where the time of year dictated the duration and magnitude of the storm induced response of the hyporheic zone.Show less"
6,"Riviere, A",Sep 19 2014 ,Experimental and numerical assessment of transient stream-aquifer exchange during disconnection,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Understanding the state of connection processes of stream-aquifer systems is of great interest for water resources management, particularly in semi-arid regions and where groundwater is extracted in the vicinity of a river bank. Here we present a combined experimental-numerical study to explain physical processes involved in disconnected stream-aquifer systems. A stream-aquifer sand box was built to measure the infiltration rate through the stream bed during aquifer drainage. The pressures in the saturated zone of the aquifer and the infiltration rate were measured in order to quantify the fluid flow in this system. The transient transitional stage between connected and disconnected flow regimes, which was obtained experimentally, is characterised by a maximum infiltration rate across the stream bed before a decrease towards a constant value. This behaviour is analysed by means of transient numerical simulations using relevant hydrodynamic parameters. The importance of the drainage kinematics and unsaturated zone parameters for the temporal variation of the infiltration rate is demonstrated. The possible occurrence of a maximum infiltration rate value during the transitional stage is characterised into a general view of the stream-aquifer disconnection with direct implications for pumping near a stream.

7,"Jurisa, JT",May 2012 ,The coupled Hudson River estuarine-plume response to variable wind and river forcings,OCEAN DYNAMICS,"Observations of the Hudson River plume were taken in the spring of 2006 in conjunction with the Lagrangian Transport and Transformation Experiment using mooring arrays, shipboard observations, and satellite data. During this time period, the plume was subjected to a variety of wind, buoyant, and shelf forcings, which yield vastly different responses in plume structure including a downstream recirculating eddy. During weak and downwelling winds, the plume formed a narrow buoyant coastal current that propagated downstream near the internal wave speed. Freshwater transport during periods when the downwelling wind was closely aligned with the coast was near the river discharge values. During periods with a cross-shore component to the wind, freshwater transport in the coastal current estimated by the mooring array is less than the river discharge due to a widening of the plume that leads to the internal Rossby radius scaling for the plume width to be invalid. The offshore detachment of plume and formation of a downstream eddy that is observed surprisingly persisted for 2 weeks under a variety of wind forcing conditions. Comparison between mooring, shipboard, and satellite data reveal the downstream eddy is steady in time. Shipboard transects yield a freshwater content equal to the previous 3 days of river discharge. The feature itself was formed due to a large discharge following a strong onshore wind. The plume was then further modified by a brief upwelling wind and currents influenced by the Hudson Shelf Valley. The duration of the detachment and downstream eddy can be explained using a Wedderburn number which is largely consistent with the wind strength index described by Whitney and Garvine (J Geophys Res 110:C03014 1997).Show less"
8,"Stoffers, T",Sep 10 2022 ,Freshwater fish biodiversity restoration in floodplain rivers requires connectivity and habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"With a sixth mass extinction looming and freshwater biodiversity declining at unprecedented rates, evaluating ecological efficacy of river restoration efforts is critical in combatting global biodiversity loss. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the functioning for fishes of 46 river restoration projects in the river Rhine, one of the world's most heavily engineered lowland rivers. Floodplains with permanent, either one-or two-sided lateral connectivity to the main channel, favour total fish abundance, and are essential as nursery areas for riverine fishes. Habitat heterogeneity had a strong positive effect on species richness but was negatively related with fish abundances. However, the effects of environmental variables varied between ecological groups and spatial scales. Surprisingly, richness of critical rheophilic fishes declined with large-scale habitat heterogeneity (similar to 1000 m), while it increased at small scales (similar to 100 m), possibly because of the presence of unfavourable habitats for this ecological group at larger scales. Clearly, there is no one-size fits-all design for river restoration projects. Whether a river section is free-flowing or impounded dictates the scope and efficacy of restoration projects and, within a river section, multiple complementary restoration projects might be key to mitigate freshwater fish biodiversity loss. An essential element for success is that these projects should retain permanent lateral connection to the main channel.Show less"
9,"Xie, YQ",Apr 2016 ,Uncertainty of natural tracer methods for quantifying river-aquifer interaction in a large river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The quantification of river-aquifer interaction is critical to the conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater, in particular in the arid and semiarid environment with much higher potential evapotranspiration than precipitation. A variety of natural tracer methods are available to quantify river-aquifer interaction at different scales. These methods however have only been tested in rivers with relatively low flow rates (mostly less than 5 m(3) s(-1)). In this study, several natural tracers including heat, radon-222 and electrical conductivity were measured both on vertical riverbed profiles and on longitudinal river samples to quantify river-aquifer exchange flux at both point and regional scales in the Heihe River (northwest China; flow rate 63 m(3) s(-1)). Results show that the radon-222 profile method can estimate a narrower range of point-scale flux than the temperature profile method. In particular, three vertical radon-222 profiles failed to estimate the upper bounds of plausible flux ranges. Results also show that when quantifying regional-scale river-aquifer exchange flux, the river chemistry method constrained the flux (5.20-10.39 m(2) d(-1)) better than the river temperature method (-100 to 100 m(2) d(-1)). The river chemistry method also identified spatial variability of flux, whereas the river temperature method did not have sufficient resolution. Overall, for quantifying river-aquifer exchange flux in a large river, both the temperature profile method and the radon-222 profile method provide useful complementary information at the point scale to complement each other, whereas the river chemistry method is recommended over the river temperature method at the regional scale.

We modified a conceptual model describing responses of aquatic invertebrate assemblages to stream drying to facilitate predictions of fish assemblage shifts in which thresholds of physiochemical gradients lead to punctuated losses of fish diversity as stream connectivity diminishes. We tested the applicability of this model during a record-breaking drought that reduced a perennial reach of a headwater prairie stream to a series of 12 isolated pools with variable levels of hyporheic connectivity that was associated with pool volume. We tracked fish assemblage structure in pools over seven weeks and measured abiotic conditions. Inter-specific differences in drought resistance traits were tested in the lab (i.e., thermal and hypoxia tolerance) for common species experiencing drought conditions. Species richness declined rapidly with pool volume associated with hyporheic connectivity. Abundance of the most common species prior to drought, Chrosomus erythrogaster (southern redbelly dace) declined 95% and was extirpated from five pools during drought due to its low thermal tolerance. Despite being the least tolerant to hypoxia, Campostoma anomalum (central stoneroller) populations persisted in most pools. The remaining pools became dominated by a non-native extremophile fish, Gambusia affinis (western mosquitofish) and abundances of less resistant native species declined. Our study demonstrates that richness in drying pools is driven by factors associated with pool volume, and assemblage composition shifts from dominance by native species adapted to variable hydrological conditions to non-native species able to resist increasing temperatures and hypoxia. Sudden species loss associated with reduced stream connectivity can shift abundance patterns of prairie stream fish communities with potentially lagged effects on population and community dynamics.Show less"
13,"Giblin, SM",Jun 2014 ,"Thresholds in the Response of Free-Floating Plant Abundance to Variation in Hydraulic Connectivity, Nutrients, and Macrophyte Abundance in a Large Floodplain River",WETLANDS,"Duckweed and other free-floating plants (FFP) can form dense surface mats that affect ecosystem condition and processes, and can impair public use of aquatic resources. FFP obtain their nutrients from the water column, and the formation of dense FFP mats can be a consequence and indicator of river eutrophication. We conducted two complementary surveys of diverse aquatic areas of the Upper Mississippi River as an in situ approach for estimating thresholds in the response of FFP abundance to nutrient concentration and physical conditions in a large, floodplain river. Local regression analysis was used to estimate thresholds in the relations between FFP abundance and phosphorus (P) concentration (0.167 mg l(-1)), nitrogen (N) concentration (0.808 mg l(-1)), water velocity (0.095 m s(-1)), and aquatic macrophyte abundance (65 % cover). FFP tissue concentrations suggested P limitation was more likely in spring, N limitation was more likely in late summer, and N limitation was most likely in backwaters with minimal hydraulic connection to the channel. The thresholds estimated here, along with observed patterns in nutrient limitation, provide river scientists and managers with criteria to consider when attempting to modify FFP abundance in off-channel areas of large river systems.Show less"
14,"Argent, DG",Jun 2014 ,PATTERNS OF ICHTHYOFAUNAL DISTRIBUTION AND CONNECTIVITY IN NAVIGABLE AND FREE-FLOWING REACHES OF A MAJOR RIVER SYSTEM: THE ALLEGHENY RIVER IN PENNSYLVANIA,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Connectivity throughout large riverine networks is often compromised by lock and dam (L/D) structures designed to facilitate year-round navigation. The resultant interruption of flow inhibits free passage of aquatic biota potentially isolating mainstem and tributary communities. Our objectives were (i) to evaluate the impact of a series of navigational L/D structures on two targeted fish assemblages (TFAs): large-bodied (>250mm total length) pelagic and benthic (darter) communities and (ii) to examine patterns of tributary and mainstem connectivity. We systematically captured fishes utilizing gillnets, benthic trawls and backpack electrofishers from an impounded and a free-flowing reach extending over 203km of the Allegheny River in Pennsylvania. Species richness among the large-bodied targeted fish assemblage was distributed somewhat evenly throughout each pool, peaking near dams and in an undredged pool. Depauperate darter assemblages of low species richness characterized most of the navigable reach with diversity and abundance concentrated in L/D tailrace areas. By contrast, darter communities inhabiting the free-flowing reach were more diverse, abundant and evenly distributed, indicating the influence of uninterrupted connectivity. Community similarity at mainstem/tributary junctions increased with increasing tributary size with 50% of the mainstem species complement also inhabiting the largest tributary. This study underscores the importance of dams as barriers to ichthyofaunal connectivity, particularly to those benthic fishes which are relatively immobile and habitat specific, and the importance of mainstem/tributary junctions as avenues of riverine connectivity.

15,"Bernal, S",Nov 2013 ,Hydrological extremes modulate nutrient dynamics in mediterranean climate streams across different spatial scales,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Hydrology is a key factor in the terrestrial landscape that connects upland and riparian ecosystems to streams. Hydrological connectivity through the catchment and along the stream network influences not only the timing and the magnitude of terrestrial inputs to stream ecosystems, but also regulates stream metabolism and biogeochemical cycling. In mediterranean climate regions (med-regions), there is a marked seasonal alternation of dry and wet periods, and streams experience a wide range of hydrological conditions from floods to droughts. Moreover, nutrient dynamics in med-streams are highly variable within the year and between years compared to temperate streams. In this review, we explore how seasonal changes in hydrological connectivity and hydrological extremes affect nutrient cycling and transport at different spatial scales in med-catchments. We show that during the dry period, the stream network contracts more severely in med-catchments than in temperate catchments. During the contraction phase, upland-stream disconnection decreases nutrient supply from terrestrial ecosystems, while stream fragmentation increases the spatial variation of stream nutrient concentrations. Moreover, the precipitation regime typical of med-regions (with irregular distribution of precipitation and episodic large rainfall events) decreases the ability of terrestrial and aquatic biota to retain nutrients and favours nutrient export to downstream ecosystems. Altogether, this hydrological setting confers to med-streams a characteristic temporal pattern in stream nutrient dynamics that is analogous to a particular biogeochemical heartbeat with higher amplitude, variation and unpredictability than that observed in temperate streams.Show less"
16,"Karim, F",May 15 2016 ,Impact of climate change on floodplain inundation and hydrological connectivity between wetlands and rivers in a tropical river catchment,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Surface water connectivity between waterbodies in a river-floodplain system is considered one of the key determinants of habitat quality, biodiversity and ecological integrity. This manuscript presents results from an investigation into the potential changes in floodplain inundation and connectivity between wetlands and rivers under projected future climates, in a large river catchment in Western Australia. The study was conducted using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (MIKE 21), and the modelling domain included the floodplain reaches encompassing the ecologically important wetlands. A lumped rainfall-runoff model (SIMHYD) was used to estimate local runoff and inflows from ungauged catchments. A SRTM derived 30-m elevation data was used to parameterize land topography and stream networks in the hydrodynamic model. Hydraulic roughness parameters were estimated using a land cover map, which was developed using a combination of aerial photography, topographic maps and Google Earth imagery. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated using stream gauge data and flood inundation maps derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer imagery. Model simulated stage heights were combined with land topography to identify floodplain pathways that connect wetlands with rivers.The connectivity of 30 off-stream wetlands was evaluated under present and future climates. The duration of connection of the individual wetlands to the main river channel varied from 1 to 40 days depending on flood magnitude and duration. Topographic relief, location on the floodplain and magnitude and duration of the flood were found to be key factors governing the level of connectivity, and the relationship between return period of flood and inundated area was found to be non-linear. Modelling under a drier future climate indicated that the duration of connectivity of wetlands could be up to 20% less than under the current climate, whilst under a wetter climate the connectivity could be 5% longer. The results of this study provide potential use for future studies on movement and recruitment patterns of aquatic biota, wetland habitat characteristics and water quality and wetland biodiversity assessment.

17,"Varner, TS",Dec 2022 ,"Contribution of sedimentary organic matter to arsenic mobilization along a potential natural reactive barrier (NRB) near a river: The Meghna river, Bangladesh",CHEMOSPHERE,"Elevated dissolved arsenic (As) concentrations in the shallow aquifers of Bangladesh are primarily caused by microbially-mediated reduction of As-bearing iron (Fe) (oxy)hydroxides in organic matter (OM) rich, reducing environments. Along the Meghna River in Bangladesh, interactions between the river and groundwater within the hyporheic zone cause fluctuating redox conditions responsible for the formation of a Fe-rich natural reactive barrier (NRB) capable of sequestering As. To understand the NRB's impact on As mobility, the geochemistry of riverbank sediment (<3 m depth) and the underlying aquifer sediment (up to 37 m depth) was analyzed. A 24-hr sediment-water extraction experiment was performed to simulate interactions of these sediments with oxic river water. The sediment and the sediment-water extracts were analyzed for inorganic and organic chemical parameters. Results revealed no differences between the elemental composition of riverbank and aquifer sediments, which contained 40 +/- 12 g/kg of Fe and 7 +/- 2 mg/kg of As, respectively. Yet the amounts of inorganic and organic constituents extracted were substantially different between riverbank and aquifer sediments. The water extracted 6.4 +/- 16.1 mg/kg of Fe and 0.03 +/- 0.02 mg/kg of As from riverbank sediments, compared to 154.0 +/- 98.1 mg/kg of Fe and 0.55 +/- 0.40 mg/kg of As from aquifer sediments. The riverbank and aquifer sands contained similar amounts of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) (17,705.2 +/- 5157.6 mg/kg). However, the waterextractable fraction of SOM varied substantially, i.e., 67.4 +/- 72.3 mg/kg in riverbank sands, and 1330.3 +/- 226.6 mg/kg in aquifer sands. Detailed characterization showed that the riverbank SOM was protein-like, fresh, low molecular weight, and labile, whereas SOM in aquifer sands was humic-like, older, high molecular weight, and recalcitrant. During the dry season, oxic conditions in the riverbank may promote aerobic metabolisms, limiting As mobility within the NRB.Show less"
18,"Grauso, S",Feb 2018 ,Assessment of a Simplified Connectivity Index and Specific Sediment Potential in River Basins by Means of Geomorphometric Tools,GEOSCIENCES,"Sediment connectivity is a major topic in recent research because of its relevance in the characterization of the morphology of river systems and assessing of sediment transport and deposition. Currently, the connectivity indices found in the literature are generally dimensionless and need to be coupled with quantitative soil-loss data for land management and design purposes. In the present work, a simple methodology is proposed to assess two different indices, namely, the simplified connectivity index (SCI) and the specific sediment potential (SSP), based on geomorphometric tools that are commonly available in commercial and open-source geographic information system (GIS) platforms. The proposed metrics allows us to easily assess both the SCI and the SSP as functions of the estimated soil erosion per unit area of the catchment and of the inverse distance of each unit area from the river outlet, this distance being measured along the network path. The proposed indices have been devised to express, respectively, the potential sediment transfer ability and the sediment mass potentially available at a given section of the drainage network. In addition to other parameters used to describe the catchment characteristics potentially affecting the river sediment delivery capacity, the SCI and SSP indices can help to refine theoretical models in order to assess the sediment yield (SY) in ungauged river basins.Show less"

21,"Zhang, W",2014 ,A Coupled Model of the 1D River Network and 3D Estuary Based on Hydrodynamics and Suspended Sediment Simulation,JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS,"River networks and estuaries are very common in coastal areas. Runoff from the upper stream interacts with tidal current from open sea in these two systems, leading to a complex hydrodynamics process. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the two systems as a whole to study the flow and suspended sediment transport. Firstly, a 1D model is established in the Pearl River network and a 3D model is applied in its estuary. As sufficient mass exchanges between the river network and its estuary, a strict mathematical relationship of water level at the interfaces can be adopted to couple the 1D model with the 3D model. By doing so, the coupled model does not need to have common nested grids. The river network exchanges the suspended sediment with its estuary by adding the continuity conditions at the interfaces. The coupled model is, respectively, calibrated in the dry season and the wet season. The results demonstrate that the coupled model works excellently in simulating water level and discharge. Although there are more errors in simulating suspended sediment concentration due to some reasons, the coupled model is still good enough to evaluate the suspended sediment transport in river network and estuary systems.Show less"
22,"Boulton, AJ",Jun 2000 ,River ecosystem health down under: Assessing ecological condition in riverine groundwater zones in Australia,ECOSYSTEM HEALTH,"Below many rivers and extending laterally beneath their banks lies a zone of saturated sediments-the hyporheic zone. This region is the site of dynamic exchanges of water and materials between the groundwater below, lateral alluvial aquifers, and the river flowing above. In this centrally located ecosystem component, the actions of the microbial biofilms coating the sediments are considered to act like a biological filter, enhancing water quality during the exchange process. However, the hyporheic zones in many rivers are threatened by siltation, toxicants and increasing acidity, physical extraction for gravel, or altered groundwater inputs through pumping. Current protocols to assess river health do not explicitly consider that of the hyporheic zone, despite its central role in many rivers. This oversight is due largely to the relative infancy of the discipline of hyporheic research, limited communication to river managers by ecologists, and technical difficulties in sampling the hyporheic zone. Ecosystem health assessments in rivers with potentially important hyporheic zones could include measurements of the extent of hydrological exchange between the river and the hyporheic zone at a range of scales, the rates of some key interstitial chemical processes, and perhaps the biodiversity of hyporheic invertebrates. In Australia, the potential of some of these measurements is being investigated, especially in relation to assessing the health of ""groundwater-dependent ecosystems.""Show less"
23,"Dugdale, SJ",Jan 1 2018 ,Stream temperature under contrasting riparian forest cover: Understanding thermal dynamics and heat exchange processes,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Climate change is likely to increase summer temperatures inmany river environments, raising concerns that this will reduce their thermal suitability for a range of freshwater fish species. As a result, river managers have pursued riparian tree planting due to its ability to moderate stream temperatures by providing shading. However, little is known about the relative ability of different riparian forest types to moderate streamtemperatures. Further research is therefore necessary to inform best-practise riparian tree planting strategies. This article contrasts stream temperature and energy fluxes under three riparian vegetation types common to Europe: open grassland terrain (OS), semi-natural deciduouswoodland (SNS), and commercial conifer plantation (CS). Data was recorded over the course of a year by weather stations installed in each of the vegetation types. Mean daily stream temperature was generally warmest at OS and coolest at CS. Energy gains at all sites were dominated by shortwave radiation, whereas losses where principally due to longwave and latent heat flux. The magnitude of shortwave radiation received at the water surface was strongly dependent upon vegetation type, with OS and SNS woodland sites receiving approximately 6x and 4x (respectively) the incoming solar radiation of CS. Although CS lost less energy through longwave or latent fluxes than the other sites, net surface heat flux was ordered OS > SNS > CS, mirroring the stream temperature results. These findings demonstrate that energy fluxes at the air-water interface vary substantially between different riparian forest types and that stream temperature response to bankside vegetation depends upon the type of vegetation present.

24,"Bray, EN",Sep 2017 ,Subsurface flow in lowland river gravel bars,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Geomorphic and hydraulic processes, which form gravel bars in large lowland rivers, have distinctive characteristics that control the magnitude and spatial patterns of infiltration and exfiltration between rivers and their immediate subsurface environments. We present a bedform-infiltration relation together with a set of field measurements along two reaches of the San Joaquin River, CA to illustrate the conditions required for infiltration and exfiltration of flow between a stream and its undulating bed, and a numerical model to investigate the factors that affect paths and residence times of flow through barforms at different discharges. It is shown that asymmetry of bar morphology is a first-order control on the extent and location of infiltration, which would otherwise produce equal areas of infiltration and exfiltration under the assumption of sinusoidal bedforms. Hydraulic conductivity varies by orders of magnitude due to fine sediment accumulation and downstream coarsening related to the process of bar evolution. This systematic variability not only controls the magnitude of infiltration, but also the residence time of flow through the bed. The lowest hydraulic conductivity along the reach occurred where the difference between the topographic gradient and the water-surface gradient is at a maximum and thus where infiltration would be greatest into a homogeneous bar, indicating the importance of managing sand supply to maintain the ventilation and flow through salmon spawning riffles. Numerical simulations corroborate our interpretation that infiltration patterns and rates are controlled by distinctive features of bar morphology.Show less"
25,"Michaelis, T",Sep 21 2022 ,High-resolution vertical biogeochemical profiles in the hyporheic zone reveal insights into microbial methane cycling,BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Facing the challenges of climate change, policy making relies on sound greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. Rivers and streams emit large quantities of the potent GHG methane (CH4), but their global impact on atmospheric CH4 concentrations is highly uncertain. In situ data from the hyporheic zone (HZ), where most CH4 is produced and some of it can be oxidized to CO2, are lacking for an accurate description of CH4 production and consumption in streams. To address this, we recorded high-resolution depth-resolved geochemical profiles at five different locations in the stream bed of the river Moosach, southern Germany. Specifically, we measured pore-water concentrations and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) of dissolved CH4 as well as relevant electron acceptors for oxidation with a 1 cm vertical depth resolution. Findings were interpreted with the help of a numerical model, and 16S rRNA gene analyses added information on the microbial community at one of the locations. Our data confirm with pore-water CH4 concentrations of up to 1000 mu mol L-1 that large quantities of CH4 are produced in the HZ. Stable isotope measurements of CH4 suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis represents a dominant pathway for CH4 production in the HZ of the river Moosach, while a relatively high abundance of a novel group of methanogenic archaea, the Candidatus ""Methanomethyliales"" (phylum Candidatus ""Verstraetearchaeota""), indicate that CH4 production through H-2 dependent methylotrophic methanogenesis might also be an important CH4 source. Combined isotopic and modeling results clearly implied CH4 oxidation processes at one of the sampled locations, but due to the steep chemical gradients and the close proximity of the oxygen and nitrate reduction zones, no single electron acceptor for this process could be identified. Nevertheless, the numerical modeling results showed potential not only for aerobic CH4 oxidation but also for anaerobic oxidation of CH4 coupled to denitrification. In addition, the nitrate-methane transition zone was characterized by an increased relative abundance of microbial groups (Crenothrix, NC10) known to mediate nitrate and nitrite-dependent methane oxidation in the hyporheic zone.This study demonstrates substantial CH4 production in hyporheic sediments, a potential for aerobic and anaerobic CH4 oxidation, and underlines the high spatiotemporal variability in this habitat.Show less"
26,"Rabanaque, MP",Jan 2022 ,Basin-wide hydromorphological analysis of ephemeral streams using machine learning algorithms,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Sustainable river management now encompasses a much wider concept that includes hydromorphological and fluvial habitat studies. In ephemeral streams, the geomorphological characterization of channels is complex due to episodic flows and riparian vegetation dynamics. Stream channel survey and classification at the watershed scale provide the basis for geomorphological conservation, process interpretation, assessing sensitivity to disturbance, and identifying reaches that supply and store sediment. Here, we present a stream classification based on a two-step approach: (1) automatic river segmentation based on spatial variability in channel/valley morphology from topographic measurements (LiDAR, light, detection and ranging), and (2) fluvial landform and vegetation density mapping derived from multispectral open-source satellite images (Sentinel-2) using support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. These analyses provide continuous, quantitative spatial values of geometric (channel/valley width, slope gradient, and route distance), landform (active channel and gravel bars with five densities of vegetation cover), and hydraulic (specific stream power) variables. Four stream types were identified in the Rambla de la Viuda catchment (similar to 1500 km(2)), an ephemeral gravel-bed river in eastern Spain. The spatial distribution of channel types is explained by differences in geometry (active channel width, valley width, and slope gradient) and a hydraulic parameter (specific stream power). The landforms/vegetation patterns provided insight on causal relationships between erosion and deposition processes during high flow periods and the time since the most recent large disruptive flood event. Channel type distribution provided first-order predictions about the location of reaches that supply and store sediment and thus information on sediment continuity along the river. Dam effects on downstream reaches resulted in geomorphological disequilibrium, producing narrowing of the active channel, slope reduction, and a decrease of gravel bar areal extension. The proposed catchment scale analysis provides a comprehensive and replicable methodology for environmental planning in Mediterranean ephemeral streams to guide further hydromorphological surveys at the reach scale.Show less"
27,"Schade, JD",Mar 2005 ,Hydrologic exchange and N uptake by riparian vegetation in an arid-land stream,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Riparian zones can strongly influence the exchange of nutrients between streams and their watersheds. Most riparian studies have been done in mesic watersheds, which differ significantly from arid-land watersheds hydrologically. The goals of our work were to determine the strength and direction of hydrologic linkages between stream and riparian zone, and to estimate the extent of uptake of streamwater N by riparian trees in Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran Desert stream. Br and (NH4-)-N-15 were added simultaneously to the surface stream to trace water and N from stream to riparian zone. Br concentrations in riparian wells installed downstream of the release point increased during the addition, demonstrating a strong hydrologic linkage from stream to riparian zone. Percentage stream water in wells increased in a downstream direction, Suggesting little or no input of water laterally from uplands or vertically from deep groundwater. Leaf and wood samples collected from willow trees downstream of the addition point became significantly labeled with N-15 during the addition, indicating uptake of streamwater N. Other tree species did not become labeled, most likely because they were located farther from the stream channel than the willows. Results from our study provide evidence of strong hydrologic linkage between stream and riparian zone and suggest that N demand by riparian vegetation is a potentially significant sink for streamwater N.Show less"

We used detailed field observations of the Truckee River, Nevada from 2003 to 2009 to quantify fluid flux between the river and a fluvial island, the streambed, and the adjacent stream bank. We constructed a 3-D numerical flow and heat transport model to further quantify the complex flow paths. Our study expands on previous research typically confined to less comprehensive scales and dimensions, and highlights the transient multidimensionality of the flow field. In fact, 1-D vertical streambed flux estimates indicated that the channel bar tail displayed the highest upward flux throughout the summer; however, 3-D model results indicated that the horizontal contribution was two orders of magnitude higher than the vertical contribution. The channel bar net flux is typically 1.5 orders of magnitude greater than the adjacent stream banks and an order of magnitude less than net streambed fluxes, indicating significant differences in river-aquifer interactions between each of the geomorphic units. Modeling simulations further indicated that the channel bar induces 6 times more fluid flux than an identical location without a fluvial island, consistent with flux estimates from a nearby river restoration location. Moreover, event-based and seasonal transient antecedent moisture and near-stream storage conditions contribute to multidimensional river-groundwater interactions. These results suggest that fluvial islands are a key driver and significant component of river-groundwater interactions and hyporheic flow.Show less"
29,"Kunkel, U",Aug 1 2011 ,Reactive Tracer Test To Evaluate the Fate of Pharmaceuticals in Rivers,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"The fate of pharmaceutically active substances in rivers is still only incompletely understood, especially as the knowledge transfer from laboratory experiments to the real world is complicated by factors like turbidity, hydrodynamics, or heterogeneity. Therefore, we performed a tracer test with pharmaceutically active substances to study their fate and the importance of individual attenuation mechanisms in situ. The experiment was carried out at a small stream in central Sweden. Two dye tracers and six pharmaceuticals were injected as Dirac pulse and water was sampled at five downstream sites along a 16-km-long river reach. Ibuprofen and clofibric acid were the only compounds which were eliminated along the study reach at half-life times of 10 h and 2.5 d, respectively. Based on the shape of the breakthrough curves and the low hydraulic conductivity of the river bed, we can assume that exchange of river water with the hyporheic zone was minor. Thus, the contribution of processes in the hyporheic zone to the attenuation of pharmaceuticals was low. We hypothesize that ibuprofen and clofibric acid were transformed by in-stream biofilms growing on submerged macrophytes and at the water-sediment interface. Phototransformation and sorption were ruled out as major attenuation processes. No attenuation of bezafibrate, diclofenac, metoprolol, and naproxen was observed.Show less"

An integrated modeling approach, combining hydrological and coupled hydrodynamic-fecal indicator bacteria models, was applied to selected scenarios of relevant forcings, on the basis of previously calibrated and validated model applications. The forcings investigated included: tides, winds, waves, atmospheric pressure, bathymetry, river flow, and upstream fecal bacteria concentrations; this study targeted the characterization of the relative importance of these factors on the fecal contamination dynamics, to enhance our understanding of small coastal streams water quality dynamics. Results highlight distinct patterns for dry and wet periods. Fecal bacteria transport is mainly forced by tidal propagation, in dry periods; and by freshwater flows, during wet periods. The analysis reveals a complex hydraulic and water quality dynamic resulting from the interactions between the environmental forcings and strongly dependent on their relative strength. This analysis can be extrapolated for systems with a similar balance between the environmental factors. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.Show less"
31,"Brunke, M",1999 ,Colmation and depth filtration within streambeds: Retention of particles in hyporheic interstices,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY,"Colmation refers to the retention processes that can lead to the clogging of the top layer of channel sediments and decolmation refers to the resuspension of deposited fine particles. Internal colmation, clogging of the interstices directly below the armor layer, may form a thin seal that disconnects surface water from hyporheic water by inhibiting exchange processes. The settling of particles under low flow conditions can cause external colmation. Colmated channel sediments are characterized by reduced porosity and hydraulic conductivity as well as by a consolidated texture. The term 'depth filtration' refers to the transport and storage of fine matrix sediments in interstitial layers. Depth filtration is of significance for the transport of colloidal and fine particulate inorganic as well as organic matter within the hyporheic interstices and into the alluvial aquifer. The role of depth filtration is assessed for the content (given in mg/per liter) of matrix fine particles retained in the coarse framework sediment of a gravel-bed;river in Switzerland. Sediment samples were taken by freeze-coring with liquid nitrogen down to 70 cm depth and by piezometers down to 150 cm depth. Seventy-two percent of the mobile matrix fine particles were smaller than 0.1 mm and 50% were smaller than 0.03 mm. The content of fines tended to increase with depth, although higher accumulations were found at intermediate depths in sediments influenced by 'exfiltrating ground water. Interstitial detrital particles >90 mu m showed vertical distribution patterns opposing those of total particles. These relationships revealed a differential significance of import, storage, and transport within three types of hydrological exchange zones (infiltration, horizontal advection, exfiltration) in the cross-section of the stream.Show less"
32,"Angermann, L",Dec 19 2012 ,A 3D analysis algorithm to improve interpretation of heat pulse sensor results for the determination of small-scale flow directions and velocities in the hyporheic zone,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hyporheic zone is strongly influenced by the adjacent surface water and groundwater systems. It is subject to hydraulic head and pressure fluctuations at different space and time scales, causing dynamic and heterogeneous flow patterns. These patterns are crucial for many biogeochemical processes in the shallow sediment and need to be considered in investigations of this hydraulically dynamic and biogeochemical active interface. For this purpose a device employing heat as an artificial tracer and a data analysis routine were developed. The method aims at measuring hyporheic flow direction and velocity in three dimensions at a scale of a few centimeters. A short heat pulse is injected into the sediment by a point source and its propagation is detected by up to 24 temperature sensors arranged cylindrically around the heater. The resulting breakthrough curves are analyzed using an analytical solution of the heat transport equation. The device was tested in two laboratory flow-through tanks with defined flow velocities and directions. Using different flow situations and sensor arrays the sensitivity of the method was evaluated. After operational reliability was demonstrated in the laboratory, its applicability in the field was tested in the hyporheic zone of a low gradient stream with sandy streambed in NE-Germany. Median and maximum flow velocity in the hyporheic zone at the site were determined as 0.9 x 10(-4) and 2.1 x 10(-4) m s(-1) respectively. Horizontal flow components were found to be spatially very heterogeneous, while vertical flow component appear to be predominantly driven by the streambed morphology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Stream-water samples were collected upstream and downstream of the braided section at fortnightly intervals throughout the 2001-2002 hydrological year and subsequently at finer resolution over two rainfall events. The braided reach was found to exert a significant downstream buffering effect on the alkalinity of these waters, particularly at moderate flows (4-8 m(3) s(-1)/congruent toQ(30-70)). Extensive hydrochemical surveys were undertaken to characterize the different source waters feeding the braids. Shallow groundwater flow systems at the edge of the braided floodplain, recharged by effluent streams and hillslope drainage, appeared to be of particular significance. Deeper groundwater was identified closer to the main channel, upwelling through the hyporheic zone. Both sources contributed to the significant groundwater-surface-water interactions that promote the buffering effect observed through the braided reach. Their impact was less significant at higher flows (> 15 m(3) s(-1)/>Q(10)) when acidic storm runoff from the peat-covered catchment headwaters dominated, as well as under baseflow conditions (<4 m(3) s(-1)/Show less"
34,"Favaro, C",Dec 2014 ,Potential loss and rehabilitation of stream longitudinal connectivity: fish populations in urban streams with culverts,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Riverine connectivity is important to the persistence of fish communities, but culverts may impede fish movements to varying degrees and in both directions. Baffles can be installed in culverts to mitigate upstream connectivity loss; however, evaluation of their effectiveness is limited. To examine the potential impacts of culverts and their potential rehabilitation with baffles, we sampled fish populations in 26 streams that contained either (i) nonbaffled culverts or (ii) baffled culverts or (iii) lacked culverts (reference streams) in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Using mixed effects models, we compared fish responses across these three stream types to infer effects at the whole-stream scale (i.e., over both upstream and downstream positions equally), the within-stream scale (i.e., upstream versus downstream of culverts), and the interaction of scales. Densities (n.m(-2)) of coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) were significantly lower in nonbaffled and baffled stream types than in reference stream types, while densities of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were significantly lower in reference stream types, indicating whole-stream differences. Using multivariate statistics, we similarly found that fish community compositions were significantly different across stream types. For our various fish responses, we found no interaction between stream type and upstream or downstream position. Further, we found reaches directly downstream of baffled culverts had greater fish biomass and that overall species richness increased with age of baffles. These data suggest that culverts may drive changes in fish populations at whole-stream scales, and restoration of these effects with baffles may take decades.Show less"
35,"Liu, SD",Dec 2018 ,Hydrologic controls on pCO(2) and CO2 efflux in US streams and rivers,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS,"Streams and rivers emit petagrams of CO2, yet there is little known about how discharge variability impacts stream CO2 at broad scales. This article analyzed changes of pCO(2) and CO2 efflux with discharge in 813 conterminous US streams and rivers. Half of the streams and rivers (49%) showed positive pCO(2)-discharge responses, while significantly more (80%) showed positive CO2 efflux-discharge responses. More CO2 efflux therefore occurred at higher discharge. While CO2 efflux tended to increase with discharge at all stream orders, pCO(2) tended to decrease with discharge in small rivers (stream order 1-6) and increase in large rivers (stream order 7-10). Small streams and rivers tended to release more CO2 at higher discharge due to highly responsive gas transfer velocity. While high CO2 efflux in small streams (stream order 1-3) pointed to strong terrestrial input, high CO2 responsiveness in large rivers was likely due to increased riverine metabolism and river-corridor exchanges.Show less"
36,"Miller, WL",Oct 2015 ,The importance of terrestrial dispersal for connectivity among headwater salamander populations,ECOSPHERE,"Many organisms are primarily constrained to the channels of the upstream terminus of river networks with limited capacities for both in-stream and overland dispersal. Dispersal is believed to contribute to gene flow and the demographic stability of headwater populations. While assumed, the importance of overland dispersal to gene flow is largely unexplored in headwater salamanders. Six microsatellite markers were used to assess patterns of genetic population structure for a headwater salamander, Desmognathus fuscus. Tissue samples were collected using a nested hierarchical study design, which specifically addressed the contribution of overland movements to the genetic connectivity of headwater populations. Genetic divergence was significant among all populations (F-st = 0.027-0.405) and at all hierarchical spatial scales. However, lower degrees of genetic population structure were observed among proximal streams that shared no downstream hydrologic connections. Mantel tests indicated a significant relationship between genetic divergence and overland distance, suggesting that D. fuscus populations conform to an isolation-by-distance model of gene flow. Estimated dispersal among headwater streams was limited, with an average of less than one effective migrant per generation moving between paired headwater streams. These results indicate that regional patterns of genetic population structure are influenced by overland dispersal and suggest the importance of terrestrial movements in maintaining population connectivity among D. fuscus populations.Show less"
37,"Cooper, JR",Apr 2018 ,Does the permeability of gravel river beds affect near-bed hydrodynamics?,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"The permeability of river beds is an important control on hyporheic flow and the movement of fine sediment and solutes into and out of the bed. However, relatively little is known about the effect of bed permeability on overlying near-bed flow dynamics, and thus on fluid advection at the sediment-water interface. This study provides the first quantification of this effect for water-worked gravel beds. Laboratory experiments in a recirculating flume revealed that flows over permeable beds exhibit fundamental differences compared with flows over impermeable beds of the same topography. The turbulence over permeable beds is less intense, more organised and more efficient at momentum transfer because eddies are more coherent. Furthermore, turbulent kinetic energy is lower, meaning that less energy is extracted from the mean flow by this turbulence. Consequently, the double-averaged velocity is higher and the bulk flow resistance is lower over permeable beds, and there is a difference in how momentum is conveyed from the overlying flow to the bed surface. The main implications of these results are three-fold. First, local pressure gradients, and therefore rates of material transport, across the sediment-water interface are likely to differ between impermeable and permeable beds. Second, near-bed and hyporheic flows are unlikely to be adequately predicted by numerical models that represent the bed as an impermeable boundary. Third, more sophisticated flow resistance models are required for coarse-grained rivers that consider not only the bed surface but also the underlying permeable structure. Overall, our results suggest that the effects of bed permeability have critical implications for hyporheic exchange, fluvial sediment dynamics and benthic habitat availability. (c) 2017 The Authors.

However, the characterization of hyporheic exchange dynamics has thus far failed to adequately account for the complex subsurface heterogeneity of river bed sediments in a spatial explicitly manner, in particular for highly complex lowland river bed sediments. Here we demonstrate the ability of ground penetrating radar (GPR) to efficiently map floodplain and river bed sediment structures within a lowland meandering river. The aim of this study was to delineate the type and spatial extent of complex, texturally heterogeneous facies of high and low conductive streambed materials. GPR surveys in this study involved not only state-of-the-art terrestrial applications but also an aquatic survey conducted from a floating rig. The surveys revealed substantial sub-surface heterogeneity of depositional materials in the streambed and riparian zone. Eight characteristic radar facies were identified through the floodplain and ground-truthed against core samples and exposures of bank deposits. The majority of GPR profiles were dominated by trough-shaped depositional elements with erosional, curved, concave upward bounding surfaces, indicative of abandoned and chute stream channel structures. The identified abandoned channel structure was found to extend into the riverbed and to be filled by suspension fall-out fine-grained deposits (mud with organic matter and interbedded clay as indicated by observed signal attenuations). GPR proved to be a successful method to identify the spatial patterns of low conductivity peat and clay structures in the streambed and riparian zone of the investigated meander bend, highlighting its potential for larger scale analysis of these structures that have shown to control the exchange flow patterns between groundwater and surface water in lowland rivers.

Thirty-one landform types were defined with respect to their role within sediment cascades. As such, the classification and the related symbology partly differ from a traditional geomorphological map where several areal objects are frequently represented by scaled and rotated point symbols. The catchment (similar to 130 km(2)), exhibits a high geomorphological variability as well as relatively large glacierized areas. We used the geomorphological map for a first qualitative estimate of the main differences between the two major sub-basins concerning the components of the sediment cascades: while the Trafoi sub-catchment exhibits a high number of small landslides and debris flow channels (i.e. source and transport landforms), the Sulden sub-catchment is rather characterized by large proglacial and talus landforms (i.e. temporary storage landforms).Show less"

Connectivity of the largest boulder and cobble fractions has been evaluated in steep streams found in the transitional zones between the hillslopes and alluvial cones of similar lithology and watershed morphometry. Two longitudinal profiles affected by past debris-flow activity and two longitudinal profiles void of such processes were selected. In the first case, active channels were characterised by the presence of the coarsest fraction, while a downstream trend of sediment coarsening or fining lacked any influence of contemporary fluvial processes and sediment supply. In addition, debris-flow-affected streams showed greater differences between the middle axis of the coarsest particle and the particle-size index including the lengths of all three axes, which is most likely the result of limited active fluvial transport. All the studied streams demonstrated general downstream fining of the largest particles, which resulted from local flysch lithology containing more resistant sandstones in the upper parts of the watershed. The trend of sediment fining was more rapid in the longitudinal profiles unaffected by past debris flows. These types of streams also showed adjustment of the coarsest bed fraction to contemporary processes in channels by sediment coarsening in incised reaches and sediment fining in depositional reaches as well as by downstream response to some lateral sediment inputs. The index of the unit stream power showed no correlation with the considered coarsest fraction in both fluvial-dominated channels and debris-flow-affected channels.Show less"

The exchange of water between the surface-subsurface generates the hyporheic exchange flow: the engine that drives the ecological functioning of the HZ. The magnitude and direction of hydrological fluxes in theHZ followcomplex spatial patterns, strongly influenced by the temporal dynamics of surface flow in rivers.The direction and magnitude of hydrological fluxes also shapes the structure of hyporheic communities (hyporheos). During surface disturbances such as flooding or drought, benthic organisms may also use the HZ as a refuge, although the importance of this role is debated.Streambed organisms differ in their ability to colonize the HZ depending on the biological traits they possess. The reduction in oxygen concentration and pore size with increasing sediment depth imposes a limit on the distribution of macroinvertebrates, which are replaced by a suite of smaller organisms (meiofauna and protists) at deeper sediment layers. Therefore, a concomitant reduction in net biomass and productivity might be expected through depth. However, only a few studies have assessed the contribution of the hyporheos to whole system production, and they have focused only on the fraction of relatively large organisms.The bioreactor ability of the HZ to transform nutrients and pollutants is an important ecosystem service sustained by the life activities of hyporheos. Biofilms have the key role in this process due to their capacity to metabolize a wide range of dissolved compounds, including emerging pollutants. However, the residence time of water in pore sediments (resulting from hyporheic exchange flow) and the rest of the community (constantly reworking the sediments and grazing biofilms) are indirectly involved.

42,"Shakhane, T",Jun 2019 ,An investigation into structural discretisation as a first-order and pilot framework to understand groundwater-stream water connectivity at a reach scale,SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"This study undertook a structural discretisation as a first-order and pilot framework to understand groundwater-stream connectivity at a local to reach scale. Structural discretisation was used as the categorisation of hydrogeological landscapes, where areas having relatively uniform geology and hydrogeological characteristics were conceived of as a single-hydrologic landscape. The results of the study led to the development of reach-scale groundwater-stream typologies, a new paradigm recommended as a first-order and pilot tool to establish a groundwater-surface water interaction framework in similar settings. The typology on the southeastern side reach of the study area is the lateral contact type where groundwater enters the riparian area aquifer from the terrestrial area aquifer through the laterally continuous alluvial gravel sequence. Therefore, over-abstraction from the terrestrial and/or riparian area aquifer may result in the loss of baseflow into the river. The confined contact-type typology operates on the northern reach where the groundwater-surface exchange primarily takes place between the stream and the riparian area aquifer because, due to low-hydraulic conductivities, the terrestrial area aquifer only permits little groundwater to enter or leave the terrestrial area aquifer. In this case, progressive over-abstractions from the riparian area will primarily draw water originating from the stream through transmission losses, resulting in progressively induced stream infiltration. Consequently, groundwater-surface water interaction typologies can also play a key role in the formulation of conjunctive water resource management for greater water supply security and stability.Show less"

The studied lakes were selected because of their position at opposite ends of a surface connectivity gradient. Los Matadores Lake, with high connectivity, has a direct connection to the river via a short channel that is active during a large part of the year. At the other extreme, the low connectivity El Tigre Lake has an indirect connection to the river through a swampy area that is only active for short periods. During ordinary hydrologic periods, zooplankton abundance and species richness appear to be controlled by the degree of connectivity of the lakes. Abundance was higher in El Tigre, which is isolated for longer periods and consequently has a longer water-residence time. Contrary to expectations, species richness was also higher in this lake, a result that was surprising because water bodies with low conectivity/disturbance are predicted to have a lower biodiversity. This unexpected outcome reflects the nature of the connecting route, which crosses a long and complex swampy ecotone.Show less"
45,"Reis, V",Aug 2019 ,Conservation planning for river-wetland mosaics: A flexible spatial approach to integrate floodplain and upstream catchment connectivity,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,"Systematic conservation planning has contributed to the spatial design of reserve networks in river ecosystems by recognizing the importance of maintaining longitudinal connectivity. In the complex and dynamic landscapes of river-floodplain systems, however, it is still challenging to account for the longitudinal and, especially, lateral connections that are relevant to their management. Adequate protection of floodplain ecosystems requires accounting for spatio-temporal connectivity among all waterbodies that compose the riverine landscape. In this study we present a new framework to account for both within-floodplain (lateral) and longitudinal river connectivity in freshwater systematic conservation planning. We run four prioritization scenarios comparing different rules of connectivity for the rivers and floodplains of the entire Amazon River basin. The scenarios involved the comparison of local protection only versus integrated upstream protection for floodplains. The spatial framework combined two types of planning units, with connectivity between them assessed using two distance-based measures for within-floodplain and upstream-downstream connectivity. We found different levels of protection afforded to floodplain wetlands across scenarios. The scenario including only within-floodplain connectivity failed to detect the propagation of impacts from the surroundings and upstream catchment. In contrast, the scenario that integrated within-floodplain and longitudinal river connectivity agglomerated subcatchments around the priority wetlands, generating catchment-integrated units that efficiently reduced impacts. We also demonstrate that the integrated connectivity can be manipulated to meet different conservation objectives. The new approach presented here offers more ecologically meaningful protection to floodplains because it considers local wetland boundaries and connectivity within wetland complexes together with connectivity with the upstream landscape. This framework can be applied to integrated wetland conservation and management throughout the world and provide a valuable tool to safeguard the ecosystem functioning of complex river-floodplain mosaics.Show less"

The observed reduction in [NO3-] along the reach results from one or more internal sinks, not dilution by ground water, hill-slope water, or other water inputs. Observed reductions in [NO3-] and channel discharge along the experimental reach result in a net loss of 200-400 kg/d of NO3--N, similar to 50% of the input load. High-resolution (temporal and spatial) sampling indicates that most of the NO3- loss occurs along the lower part of the reach, where there is the greatest seepage loss and surface-subsurface exchange of water. Stable isotopes of NO3-, total dissolved P concentrations, and streambed chemical profiles suggest that denitrification is the most significant NO(3)(-)sink along the reach. Denitrification efficiency, as expressed through downstream enrichment in N-15-NO3-, varies considerably during the water year. When discharge is greater (typically earlier in the water year), denitrification is least efficient and downstream enrichment in N-15-NO3- is greatest. When discharge is lower, denitrification in the streambed appears to occur with greater efficiency, resulting in lower downstream enrichment in N-15-NO3-Show less"
47,"Zhu, HY",Dec 2019 ,Nitrogen cycles within the stream-to-riparian continuum under flood waves,EPISODES,"By using a 2D-coupled flow and solute transport and reaction model across the stream-to-riparian continuum, this paper systematically studied the nitrogen-cycling processes driven by a flood wave and their spatial-temporal distributions. The influences on hyporheic nitrogen removal of different waves that vary by amplitude (A), duration (T), wave-type parameter (r) and rising duration (t(p)) were investigated. During the surface-water-infiltration period, the aerobic respiration, nitrification and denitrification in the hyporheic zone were gradually enhanced, and aerobic respiration was dominant. During the groundwater-backflow period, the reactions gradually weakened, and the role of denitrification was improved. The consumption of each solute continuously increased in the whole process, and the groundwater-backflow period corresponded to a larger consumption but at a smaller consumption rate. The reaction rates in space from high to low were as follows: riparian phreatic zone > variable saturated zone > stream bed. Hyporheic nitrogen removal increased with increasing A, T and t(p )and with decreasing]; which was contrary to the change rule of nitrogen removal efficiency. The hyporheic nitrogen removal exhibited a good linear relationship with the polynomial 'A*T*t(p)/r which had great predictive significance.Show less"
48,"Moldovan, OT",Jan 2013 ,A simple method for assessing biotic indicators and predicting biodiversity in the hyporheic zone of a river polluted with metals,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The task of designating biotic indicators for the assessment of the ecological status of freshwater environments is difficult. The purpose of this study was to develop a method that uses different ecological categories of Crustacea from the hyporheic zone of the Aries River (north-western Romania) to monitor water and sediment quality. Samples of fauna, water and sediments were collected monthly during one year and classification and regression tree analysis was employed to identify bioindicator species and predict the effects of metal pollution on species diversity. For almost all dissolved metals and those partitioned into sediments in the hyporheic zone, microcrustaceans were good indicators of pollution, as they were absent in samples where concentrations of these elements were high. Most macrocrustaceans were good indicators only for high concentrations of Cu and Zn in water, and only one macrocrustaceans, Niphargus transylvanicus, could be considered as good indicator for sediment metal pollution. Hyporheic microcrustaceans such as Elaphoidella elaphoides, and representatives of Acanthocyclops and Bryocamptus cuspidatus should be used in future hyporheic zone quality assessments. The statistical method described by this study can also be applied for communities in surface habitats and for other types of pollutants. Typical hyporheos species can successfully indicate past or discontinuous pollution episodes and river basin managements should consider their use together with the benthic species to monitor water quality.

49,"Han, BS",Feb 2014 ,Detailed river stage mapping and head gradient analysis during meander cutoff in a laboratory river,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Analytical models of river evolution predict meander narrowing and elongation which creates sinuosity-driven hyporheic exchange across the meander neck, by decreasing flow distance and increasing head loss. We used a laboratory river table and close range photogrammetry to map and analyze sinuosity as a driver of head gradients and hyporheic exchange during cutoff. The river valley had relatively high slopes (1.8%) and moderately cohesive sediment (10% talc, 90% sand) to facilitate cutoff, and ratios of horizontal to vertical scaling were distorted to achieve dynamic similitude (Re=3200). Incipient to cutoff, the head gradient across the neck increased due to a narrowing neck, upstream aggradation, and downstream degradation. Longitudinal and transverse river surface slopes around the meander bend increased as the meander approached cutoff. The steep head gradient across the moderately cohesive meander neck generated seepage erosion and scour that formed a low-sinuosity avulsion. Sediment-rich flow in the avulsed channel aggraded the downstream bed and separated the active channel and oxbow lake. The limitation in geometric and dynamic similitude in the river table limits extrapolation to natural rivers, yet river evolution may involve aggradation and degradation induced channel head loss and turnover hyporheic exchange as well as seepage-induced meander neck erosion. Our submillimeter maps of meander morphology and water stage provide data to parameterize river evolution and hyporheic exchange models, and may inform analysis and mapping of field sites.Key Points Novel method to create free water surface maps along laboratory meander Laboratory meander evolves through neck cutoff and free water surface change Meander evolution triggers cycle of hydraulic gradient and hyporheic flux changeShow less"
