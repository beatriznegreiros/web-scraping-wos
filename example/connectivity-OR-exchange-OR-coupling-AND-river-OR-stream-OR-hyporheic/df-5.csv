Transient hyporheic zones occur in the riparian zone (bank storage or ""lung model"" exchange) during channel stage fluctuations. Recent studies show that soil pipes are widespread in stream banks and beneath floodplains, creating highly preferential flow between channel and riparian groundwater such that the traditional Darcy model of flow does not apply. We used MODFLOW with the conduit flow package to model a series of stream bank soil pipes and examined soil pipe density (number per m), length, diameter, height above baseflow water surface, connectivity, and matrix hydraulic conductivity on transient particle flow paths and total hyporheic exchange volume (i.e., bank storage) over the course of a peak flow (e.g., storm) event. We found that adding five soil pipes per meter more than doubled hyporheic volume. Soil pipe length was the most important control; adding one 1.5-m-long soil pipe caused a 73.4% increase in hyporheic volume. The effect of increasing soil pipe diameter on hyporheic volume leveled off at similar to 1 cm, as flow limitation switched from pipe flow to pipe-matrix exchange. To validate our approach, we used the model to successfully reproduce trends from field studies. Our results highlight the need to consider soil pipes when modeling, monitoring, or managing bank storage, floodplain connectivity, or hyporheic exchange.Show less"
1,"Yi, YJ",Feb 2022 ,The impact of dams on the river connectivity of the two largest river basins in China,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Dams are built on rivers for power generation, flood prevention and control, and water resources utilization. However, dams also reduce the connectivity of rivers, which hinders the exchange of material and organisms within rivers. The Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin are the two largest river basins in China. In this study, the connectivity of these two huge and highly impacted systems was investigated. The Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) was applied to evaluate the impact on river connectivity of dams with a reservoir capacity of larger than 0.1 km(3). The results show that river connectivity decreased following an increase in dam construction. The connectivity of the Yangtze River Basin was close to 80 (0 is completely disconnected and 100 is connectivity under natural condition) in the 1980s, but declined significantly after the Gezhouba Dam was constructed on the mainstream of the Yangtze River. From 1980 to 2010, the connectivity of the Yellow River Basin was always lower than that of the Yangtze River Basin. The changes in the connectivity indices of potamodromous fish (DCIp) and diadromous fish (DCId) were determined for the period of 1980-2010. In the Yangtze River Basin, the DCIp decreased by 67.28% and the DCId decreased by 65.72%. In the Yellow River Basin, the DCIp decreased by 43.8% and the DCId decreased by 100%. In conclusion, the construction of dams, especially those on the main stream, has reduced the connectivity of the basin. The connectivity of the Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin has been severely affected.Show less"
2,"Fernald, AG",Dec 2006 ,"Water quality changes in hyporheic flow paths between a large gravel bed river and off-channel alcoves in Oregon, USA",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Changes in water quality that occur as water flows along hyporheic flow paths may have important effects on surface water quality and aquatic habitat, yet very few studies have examined these hyporheic processes along large gravel bed rivers. To determine water quality changes associated with hyporheic flow along the Willamette River, Oregon, we studied hyporheic flow at six-bar deposit sites positioned between the main river channel and connected lentic alcoves. We installed piezometers and wells at each site and measured water levels and water quality in river, hyporheic and alcove water. Piezometric surfaces along with substrate characteristics were used to determine hyporheic flow path direction and hyporheic flow rate. At all sites, hyporheic flow moved from the river through bar deposits into alcove surface water. Stable isotope analysis showed little influence of upwelling groundwater. At a majority of sites, hyporheic dissolved oxygen and ammonium decreased relative to river water, and hyporheic specific conductance, nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorous increased relative to river water. At three sites, hyporheic temperature decreased 3-7 degrees C relative to river water; there was less temperature change at the other three sites. At the two sites with the highest hyporheic flow rates, hyporheic cooling was propagated into the alcove surface water. Hyporheic changes had the greatest effect on alcove water quality at sites with highly permeable substrates and high-hyporheic flow rates. The best approach to enhancing hyporheic flows and associated water quality functions is through restoring fluviogeomorphic channel processes that create and maintain high-permeability gravel deposits conducive to hyporheic flow.

3,"Nutzmann, G",Jun 30 2014 ,Coupled groundwater flow and heat transport simulation for estimating transient aquifer-stream exchange at the lowland River Spree (Germany),HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Subsurface flow and heat transport near Freienbrink, NE Germany, was simulated in order to study groundwater-surface water exchange between a floodplains aquifer and a section of the lowland River Spree and an adjacent oxbow. Groundwater exfiltration was the dominant process, and only fast surface water level rises resulted in temporary infiltration into the aquifer. The main groundwater flow paths are identified based on a 3D groundwater flow model. To estimate mass fluxes across the aquifer-surface water interfaces, a 2D flow and heat transport modelling approach along a transect of 12 piezometers was performed. Results of steady-state and transient water level simulations show an overall high accuracy with a Spearman coefficient =0.9996 and root mean square error (RMSE)=0.008m. Based on small groundwater flow velocities of about 10-7 to 10-6ms-1, mean groundwater exfiltration rates of 233lm-2 d-1 are calculated. Short periods of surface water infiltration into the aquifer do not exceed 10days, and the infiltration rates are in the same range. The heat transport was modelled with slightly less accuracy (=0.8359 and RMSE=0.34 degrees C). In contrast to the predominant groundwater exfiltration, surface water temperatures determine the calculated temperatures in the upper aquifer below both surface water bodies down to 10m during the whole simulation period. These findings emphasize prevailing of heat conduction over advection in the upper aquifer zones, which seems to be typical for lowland streams with sandy aquifer materials and low hydraulic gradients. Moreover, this study shows the potential of coupled numerical flow and heat transport modelling to understand groundwater-surface water exchange processes in detail.

4,"Byrne, P",Aug 15 2014 ,Control of river stage on the reactive chemistry of the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"We examined the influence of river stage on subsurface hydrology and pore water chemistry within the hyporheic zone of a groundwater-fed river during the summer baseflow period of 2011. We found river stage and geomorphologic environment to control chemical patterns in the hyporheic zone. At a high river stage, the flux of upwelling water in the shallow sediments (>20 cm) decreased at sample sites in the upper section of our study reach and increased substantially at sites in the lower section. This differential response is attributed to the contrasting geomorphology of these subreaches that affects the rate of the rise and fall of a river stage relative to the subsurface head. At sites where streamward vertical flux decreased, concentration profiles of a conservative environmental tracer suggest surface water infiltration into the riverbed below depths recorded at a low river stage. An increase in vertical flux at sites in the lower subreach is attributed to the movement of lateral subsurface waters originating from the adjacent floodplain. This lateral-moving water preserved or decreased the vertical extent of the hyporheic mixing zone observed at a low river stage. Downwelling surface water appeared to be responsible for elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and manganese (Mn) concentrations in shallow sediments (0-20 cm); however, lateral subsurface flows were probably important for elevated concentrations of these solutes at deeper levels. Results suggest that DOC delivered to hyporheic sediments during a high river stage from surface water and lateral subsurface sources could enhance heterotrophic microbial activities.

5,"Bianchin, MS",Aug 18 2011 ,Defining the hyporheic zone in a large tidally influenced river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"An investigation was conducted to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the hyporheic zone of a large tidally influenced river. The field site is located on the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, approximately 30 km from its outlet to the ocean. The physical attributes of the riverbed were mapped using geophysical techniques coupled with sediment sampling. The spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater composition beneath the riverbed was determined through detailed profiling. Contaminated (fresh) groundwater discharges through a narrow band of the riverbed at a distance approximately 88-105 m from the shoreline coinciding with the termination of a massive silty unit. Saline groundwater, as part of a regional flow system, dominates the riverbed sediments from 105 m beyond the shoreline towards the centre of channel. Three water types occur within the upper 2 m of the riverbed sediments; a result of both mixing of river water, contaminated (fresh) groundwater, and saline groundwater and modification by cation exchange reactions. The interaction of these waters produced distinct zones of Ca-HCO3-, Na-Cl, and Ca-Cl type waters. The distribution of groundwater solutes indicates that during a single tidal cycle, river water penetrates the riverbed to a depth of approximately 15 cm but the long term effects of tidal pumping of river water into the riverbed is observed to a depth of approximately 1 m below the river bed.

6,"Ryan, RJ",Jun 15 2007 ,Lateral and longitudinal variation of hyporheic exchange in a piedmont stream pool,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"A conservative solute tracer experiment was conducted in Indian Creek, a small urban stream in Philadelphia, PA, to investigate the role of subsurface properties on the exchange between streamwater and the hyporheic zone (subsurface surrounding the stream). Sodium bromide (NaBr) was used as a conservative tracer, and it was monitored in the surface water and in the bed sediments of a 15 m long pool. Subsurface sampling occurred at 12 locations in the upper layer sediments (extending from 7.5 to 10 cm below the streambed) and 13 locations in the lower layer sediments (extending from 10 to 12.5 cm below the streambed). The hydraulic conductivity (K) of the upper bed sediments and the lower bed sediments was measured in situ. Several locations within the streambed exhibited an increase in tracer concentration with depth, suggesting the presence of horizontal flow paths within this small pool. Over the entire pool, the influence of K heterogeneity on hyporheic exchange was masked by the groundwater head gradient and the morphology of the stream. Together, the groundwater head gradient and stream morphology induced a generally high tracer concentration and fast hyporheic exchange on the left side and center of the channel and low concentrations and slower exchange on the right side. Although the reach-scale effects on the surface water concentration were small, groundwater greatly influenced the local-scale hyporheic exchange in the pool. Understanding how physical stream characteristics control the location and extent of hyporheic exchange pathways will lead to a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and contaminants.Show less"
7,"Mugnai, R",Nov 2015 ,Hyporheic invertebrate assemblages at reach scale in a Neotropical stream in Brazil,BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY,"In the Neotropical Region, information concerning hyporheic communities is virtually non-existent. We carried out a sampling survey in the hyporheic zone of the Tijuca River, in the Tijuca National Park, located in the urban area of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Biological samples from the hyporheic zone were collected in three different stream reaches, in June 2012. The main objectives were: 1) to describe the structure of invertebrate assemblages in the hyporheic zone of a neotropical stream; 2) to apply a reach-scale approach in order to investigate spatial patterns of the hyporheic assemblages in relation to hydrology, depth and microhabitat typology. A total of 1460 individuals were collected and identified in 31 taxa belonging to Nematoda, Annelida, Crustacea, Hydrachnidia and Insecta. The class Insecta dominated the upper layer of the hyporheic zone. Copepods were the most abundant taxon among crustaceans and occurred mostly in the upwelling areas of the reaches. The results of this study represent one of the few contributions so far about hyporheic invertebrate assemblages of the Neotropical Region.Show less"
8,"Schindler, JE",Nov 1998 ,The hyporheic zone as a source of dissolved organic carbon and carbon gases to a temperate forested stream,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"The objective of this study was to examine chemical changes in porewaters that occur over small scales (cm) as groundwater flows through the hyporheic zone and discharges to a stream in a temperate forest of northern Wisconsin. Hyporheic-zone porewaters were sampled at discrete depths of 2, 10, 15, 61, and 183 cm at three study sites in the study basin. Chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4, and pH show dramatic changes between 61 cm sediment depth and the water-sediment interface. Unless discrete samples at small depth intervals are taken, these chemical profiles are not accounted for. Similar trends were observed at the three study locations, despite each site having very different hydraulic-flow regimes. Increases in DOC concentration by an order of magnitude from 61 to 15 cm depth with a corresponding decrease in pH and rapid decreases in the molecular weight of the DOC suggest that aliphatic compounds (likely organic acids) are being generated in the hyporheic zone. Estimated efflux rates of DOG, CO2, and CH4 to the stream are 6.2, 0.79, 0.13 moles m(2) d(-1), respectively, with the vast majority of these materials produced in the hyporheic zone. Very little of these materials are accounted for by sampling stream water, suggesting rapid uptake and/or volatilization.Show less"
9,"Kim, H",Jan 2014 ,Groundwater and stream water exchange revealed by water chemistry in a hyporheic zone of agricultural area,PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT,"Groundwater-stream water exchange and mixing in a hyporheic zone were examined using the water chemistry data and multivariate statistical analyses. The study area was the Munsan stream of agricultural area in Paju, Korea. Three rounds of water samplings (August, September, and November, 2008) were conducted for five monitoring nests along the stream flow, with each having three different-depth piezometers in the streambed, one surrounding groundwater well and one stream water point. The chemical compositions of hyporheic water were controlled by those of the groundwater and stream water. The factor analysis identified four main factors that explain 67 % of total variance of the water chemistry data and also revealed that the parameters responsible for water quality variances were mainly related to rainfall, anthropogenic activities, and dissolution of carbonate minerals. The cluster analysis produced a few different groups in August (3 groups), September (4 groups), and November (4 groups), respectively, which showed that the water quality parameters of the three water bodies were very different and the hyporheic water showed a different mixing of the stream water and groundwater at each monitoring point.Show less"
10,"Wohl, E",Jun 2017 ,Connectivity in rivers,PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT,"Connectivity describes the degree to which matter and organisms can move among spatially defined units in a natural system. River connectivity is typically described in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dimensions within the river corridor and the watershed and can be conceptualized as a continuum from fully connected to disconnected over diverse temporal and spatial scales. Explicit characterization of connectivity helps understanding of disparities among short-term, local rates of flux and inferred fluxes over larger scales. Connectivity also strongly influences the response of rivers to natural and human disturbances. Investigations of connectivity facilitate the recognition of processes that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries, as well as understanding of nonlinear behavior and retention within rivers. Enhancing the ability to identify, quantify, and predict the processes that create and maintain connectivity is integral to the effective management of rivers.Show less"

While many individual studies have been conducted to investigate specific mechanisms, they have not been synthesized to account for heterogeneity in space, nonstationarity, and multiscale feedbacks that typify the river corridor. As a result, contradictory predictions of exchange flux, geometry, and timescale are prevalent in the literature. We attribute these contradictions to (a) failure to account for multiscale feedbacks and (b) uncertainty in the information content of common measurement methods. Here, we apply the concept of interacting multiscale spatial and time-variable domains to the river corridor to demonstrate why more complete multiscale characterization is necessary to achieve predictive understanding. Next, we highlight uncertainties and inconsistencies in measurement methods which may obfuscate our understanding of river corridor exchange. Finally, we briefly outline four necessary advances to achieve predictive understanding of river corridor exchange: standardization of metadata, critical evaluation of the information content and support volumes for measurement techniques, multiscale model-data integration, and advancing theoretical models of river corridor exchange.

14,"Johnson, ZC",Mar 14 2014 ,Factors affecting hyporheic and surface transient storage in a western US river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hyporheic storage accounts for a significant fraction of solute residence time in small streams and has been shown to have a large effect on the transport of solutes. It is not clear whether this characteristic is preserved in larger streams and rivers, as increased discharge and decreased slope may reduce overall exchange between the channel and subsurface, and the size of surface storage zones may increase. Conservative tracer tests conducted in the Truckee River, a stream with mean annual discharge >0.5 m(3) s(-1), were simulated with both one (1-SZ) and two-storage zone (2-SZ) transport models to quantify the relative role of surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) on the physical transport of solutes in a large stream. Tracer injections were conducted at two different discharge levels in two reaches with distinct geomorphic characteristics. STS was the dominant storage mechanism for all reaches and discharge levels and surface storage accounted for a larger fraction of median transport time (F-MED(200)) than hyporheic storage in all but one case. Increased discharge significantly reduced the influence of the HTS (primarily) and STS zones on median transport time at the study site. Comparisons with studies of discharge and geomorphic effects on TS characteristics in other streams indicated differing physical controls on STS and HTS zones. Therefore, measurements such as slope, sinuosity, width, depth, and gross gains and losses of discharge need to be considered along with discharge. This work adds to the growing sentiment that up-scaling and prediction of stream storage characteristics based on discharge and channel properties is far from straightforward. Since biogeochemical processing occurs differently in the HTS and STS, two-zone storage models provide necessary representations of transport in river systems for studies focused on aspects of water quality. Extra parameters are required for model optimization but simple cross-section surveys (area and velocity) provide enough information to ensure enhanced parameter reliability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

15,"Hester, ET",Dec 2016 ,Effects of inset floodplains and hyporheic exchange induced by in-stream structures on nitrate removal in a headwater stream,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Stream restoration efforts in the United States are increasingly aimed towards water quality improvement, yet little process-based guidance exists to compare pollutant removals from different restoration techniques for variable site conditions. Excess nitrate (NO3-) is a frequent pollutant of concern due to eutrophication in downstream waterbodies such as the Chesapeake Bay. We used MIKE SHE to simulate hydraulics and NO3- removal in a 90 m restored reach of Stroubles Creek, a second-order stream in Blacks-burg, Virginia. Site specific geomorphic, hydrologic, and hydraulic data were used to calibrate the model. We evaluated in-stream structures that induce hyporheic zone denitrification during baseflow and inset floodplains that remove NO3- during storm flows. We varied hydraulic conditions (winter baseflow, summer baseflow, storm flow), biogeochemical parameters (literature hyporheic zone denitrification rates and newly available inset floodplain removal rates) and boundary conditions (upstream NO3- concentration), sediment conditions (hydraulic conductivity), and stream restoration design parameters (inset floodplain length). Our results indicate that NO3- removal rates within the 90m reach were minimal. Structure-induced hyporheic zone denitrification did not exceed 3.1% of mass flowing in from the upstream channel, was achieved only during favorable background groundwater hydraulic conditions (i.e. summer baseflow), and was transport-limited such that non-trivial removal rates were achieved only when the streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) was at least 10(-4) m/s. Inset floodplain nitrogen removal was limited by floodplain residence time and NO3- removal rate, and did not exceed 1% of inflowing mass. Summing these removals for both restoration practices over the course of the year based on the frequency of storm and summer baseflow conditions yielded similar to 2.1% annual removal. Achieving 30% NO3- removal required increasing the length of stream reach restored to 0.9 km-819 km (depending on hydraulic conductivity) and 3.8-46 km (depending on inset floodplain length and nitrogen removal rate) for in-stream structures during baseflow and inset floodplains during storm flow, respectively. In one of the first comparisons of process-based modeling to the Chesapeake Bay Program stream restoration guidance, we found that the guidance overestimated hyporheic NO3- removal for our modeled reach, but correctly estimated inset floodplain removal. Overall, our results indicate that in-stream structures and inset floodplains can improve water quality, but overall required level of effort may be high to achieve desired results.

16,"Kawanishi, R",Nov 2017 ,Vertical migration in streams: seasonal use of the hyporheic zone by the spinous loach Cobitis shikokuensis,ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH,"Vertical hydrological connectivity between the surface stream and benthic and hyporheic zones plays a key ecological role in the biodiversity of lotic ecosystems because it allows surface and benthic organisms to use the hyporheic zone as a seasonal habitat and refuge. Use of the hyporheic zone by surface/benthic organisms has been well studied in invertebrates, but little is known about the importance of this connectivity for fishes. We investigated streambed surface and hyporheic densities (5-10, 15-20 and 20-25 cm below the streambed surface) of a stream fish, Cobitis shikokuensis, over a 20-month period in the Shigenobu River, southwestern Japan, to test the hypothesis that it uses the hyporheic zone for spawning and overwintering. In total, 1,804 individuals (13-58 mm total length) were captured from 33 streambed surface samplings and 102 individuals (10-46 mm total length) were present in 1,147 samples of 57 hyporheic samplings. Population densities in both zones peaked in late summer-early autumn due to the recruitment of age 0+ fish and a female with eggs was found in the hyporheic zone during the reproductive season. Both 0+ and older fish were absent from the streambed surface during winter, and fish densities were also lower in the hyporheic zone at this time. However, the vertical distribution of the fish tended to be skewed towards the deeper hyporheic layers from autumn to spring. These findings indicate that C. shikokuensis vertically migrates between the streambed surface and the hyporheic zone for spawning, rearing and overwintering, suggesting that the integrity of vertical hydrological connectivity in lotic systems is crucial for certain fish species.Show less"
17,"Harris, EC",Mar 2020 ,1-D Vertical Flux Dynamics in a Low-Gradient Stream: An Assessment of Stage as a Control of Vertical Hyporheic Exchange,WATER,"This study characterized vertical one-dimensional (1-D) flux rates in the top 150 cm of the streambed and explored the relationship between stage and 1-D vertical flux rates in a low-gradient stream. Six multi-level samplers were installed along a 25 m stretch of the thalweg spaced at 5 m intervals. Each sampler recorded temperature at five separate depths (30, 60, 90, and 150 cm) from February 2009 to March 2010. Temperature and stage data were collected at 15 min intervals. For the midpoint between sensors, 1-D flux rates were calculated using the 1-D conduction-advection-dispersion equation utilized in the VFLUX MATLAB program. The dominant flux direction at a depth of 15 cm was downward (negative), while the average flux directions at depths of 45, 75, and 120 cm were upward (positive). Variable flux directions above 15 cm indicated hyporheic exchange with background upwelling groundwater between 15 to 120 cm. Flux rates approach zero in the summer, representing limited hyporheic exchange. Relationships between stage and flux at the near-surface streambed (15 cm) were weak, but statistically significant, with Spearman's rank correlations for all six multi-level samplers ranging from -0.032 to 0.369 with an average of 0.085.Show less"
18,"Toran, L",May 15 2013 ,"Observing lingering hyporheic storage using electrical resistivity: variations around stream restoration structures, Crabby Creek, PA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Time-lapse geophysical surveys can map lingering hyporheic storage by detecting changes in response to saline tracer. Tracer tests were conducted in Crabby Creek, an urban stream outside Philadelphia, to examine the influence of stream restoration structures and variable sediment thickness. We compared electrical resistivity surveys with extensive well sampling (57 wells) in two 13.5-m-long reaches, each with a step drop created by a J-hook. The two step drops varied in tracer behaviour, based on both the well data and the geophysical data. The well data showed more variation in arrival time where the streambed sediment was thick and was more uniform where sediment was thin. The resistivity in the reach with thin sediment showed lingering tracer in the hyporheic zone both upstream and downstream from the J-hook. In the second reach where the sediment was thicker, the lingering tracer in the hyporheic zone was more extensive downstream from the J-hook. The contrasting results between the two reaches from both methods suggested that sediments influenced hyporheic exchange more than the step at this location. Resistivity inversion differed from well data in both reaches in that it showed evidence for tracer after well samples had returned to background, mapping lingering tracer either upstream or downstream of a step. We conclude that resistivity surveys may become an important tool for hyporheic zone characterization because they provide information on the extent of slow moving fluids in the hyporheic zone, which have the potential to enhance chemical reactions.

19,"Magliozzi, C",Sep 2019 ,Functional traits of hyporheic and benthic invertebrates reveal importance of wood-driven geomorphological processes in rivers,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Large wood (LW) is a natural element of river environments and an integral component of many river restoration schemes to promote biodiversity. It is an important habitat in itself, but it also induces a wide range of hydraulic, hydrological, geomorphological and chemical conditions that influence the ecological community. However, the effects of hydro-geomorphological processes induced by LW on local benthic and hyporheic invertebrates have not been well characterized. A functional approach was applied to invertebrate data collected in a field survey at sites with LW and without LW (control) to investigate the response of hyporheic and benthic invertebrates' trait profiles in response to local LW-induced processes. We hypothesized LW sites to be associated with different trait modalities than control sites in relation to wood-induced processes and conditions (i.e., hyporheic exchange flow, oxygen availability, temporal stability, organic matter, denitrification, hydraulic conductivity). Multivariate analyses and partial least squares (PLS) path modelling were used to detect the differences in trait profiles between LW and control sites and to study the variation of traits as a function of hydrological, sedimentological, physical and chemical variables. Biological (i.e., aquatic stages, reproduction), physiological (i.e., dispersal, feeding habits) and behavioural (i.e., substrate preferences) trait utilization by the hyporheic meiofauna differed between LW and control sites. At LW sites, the hyporheic meiofaunal assemblage was significantly associated with aquatic active dispersal, aquatic eggs and hard substrate preferences. This trait category selection was linked to changes in physical-sedimentological processes at LW sites when compared to control sites. Macrofaunal benthic and hyporheic functional traits did not differ significantly between wood and control sites, suggesting similar functioning of these assemblages at the surface-subsurface interface. This study found that LW affects invertebrate traits by altering fluvial processes to produce, locally, a mosaic of habitats. Hyporheic meiofauna trait responses to LW processes have suggested (a) the crucial role of LW in supporting river benthic zone functioning and thus (b) a possible benefit to river restoration by enhancing functional interactions among different ecological niches.

20,"Aubeneau, AF",Mar 2015 ,Effects of benthic and hyporheic reactive transport on breakthrough curves,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"In streams and rivers, the benthic and hyporheic regions harbor the microbes that process many stream-borne constituents, including O-2, nutrients, C, and contaminants. The full distribution of transport time scales in these highly reactive regions must be understood because solute delivery and extended storage in these metabolically active zones control the opportunity for biogeochemical processing. The most commonly used transport models cannot capture these effects. We present a stochastic model for conservative and reactive solute transport in rivers based on continuous-time random-walk theory, which is capable of distinguishing and capturing processes not described by classical approaches. The model includes surface and subsurface storage zones with arbitrary residence-time distributions. We used this model to evaluate the effects of sorption and biological uptake on downstream solute transport. Linear or mildly nonlinear sorption in storage delays downstream transport without changing the fundamental shape of the breakthrough curves (BTCs). Highly nonlinear sorption isotherms can induce power-law tailing in stream BTCs. Model simulations show that sorption of commonly used solute tracers is not sufficient to explain the power-law tailing that has been observed in field tracer-injection studies, and instead, such tailing most probably reflects broad distributions of hyporheic exchange time scales. First-order biological uptake causes an exponential decline in in-stream tracer concentrations at the time scale of the uptake kinetics, thereby tempering power-law BTCs. The model can be used to calculate reach-scale reaction-rate coefficients in surface and subsurface storage from observed BTCs of co-injected conservative and reactive solutes, providing new capability to determine reaction-rate coefficients in storage zones with broad residence-time distributions.Show less"
21,"Grygoruk, M",Dec 3 2021 ,Revealing the influence of hyporheic water exchange on the composition and abundance of bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrates in a temperate lowland river,KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS,"We studied distributions and abundances of macroinvertebrates in relation to hyporheic water exchange (HWE) patterns of the upper Biebrza - a small, lowland, low dynamic European river located in Northeast Poland. On a 6-km stretch of the river; we determined the variability of water exchange in the hyporheic zone by using direct field measurements of the pressure gradient to determine groundwater-surface water interactions. We identified locations with upwelling and downwelling fluxes of HWE as well as ambiguous hydraulic contact between groundwater and surface water along the river. In these locations, we sampled bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrates. In total, 627 individuals of benthic macroinvertebrates of 34 taxa were identified. We revealed that bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrate fauna is more abundant and diverse in river stretches where water from the river infiltrates the hyporheic zone. Results also show higher taxonomic richness and abundances of benthic macroinvertebrates in stretches with diagnosed infiltrating conditions (downwelling flux in a hyporheic zone) compared to in stretches where the river drained groundwater (upwelling flux in a hyporheic zone), but the recorded differences were not statistically significant.Show less"
22,"Harvey, JW",Oct 2013 ,Hyporheic zone denitrification: Controls on effective reaction depth and contribution to whole-stream mass balance,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream denitrification is thought to be enhanced by hyporheic transport but there is little direct evidence from the field. To investigate at a field site, we injected (NO3-)-N-15, Br (conservative tracer), and SF6 (gas exchange tracer) and compared measured whole-stream denitrification with in situ hyporheic denitrification in shallow and deeper flow paths of contrasting geomorphic units. Hyporheic denitrification accounted for between 1 and 200% of whole-stream denitrification. The reaction rate constant was positively related to hyporheic exchange rate (greater substrate delivery), concentrations of substrates DOC and nitrate, microbial denitrifier abundance (nirS), and measures of granular surface area and presence of anoxic microzones. The dimensionless product of the reaction rate constant and hyporheic residence time, (hzhz) define a Damkohler number, Da(den-hz) that was optimal in the subset of hyporheic flow paths where Da(den-hz) approximate to 1. Optimal conditions exclude inefficient deep pathways where substrates are used up and also exclude inefficient shallow pathways that require repeated hyporheic entries and exits to complete the reaction. The whole-stream reaction significance, R-s (dimensionless), was quantified by multiplying Da(den-hz) by the proportion of stream discharge passing through the hyporheic zone. Together these two dimensionless metrics, one flow-path scale and the other reach-scale, quantify the whole-stream significance of hyporheic denitrification. One consequence is that the effective zone of significant denitrification often differs from the full depth of the hyporheic zone, which is one reason why whole-stream denitrification rates have not previously been explained based on total hyporheic-zone metrics such as hyporheic-zone size or residence time.Show less"

We focused on faunal gradients as functions of environmental conditions reflecting 1) hydrological exchange patterns, 2) sediment depths, 3) physicochemical and fine particle gradients, and 4) interactions between these 3 factors;Three clustered sets of steel piezometers were installed at 4 depths in the sediment (20, 50, 100 150 cm) at locations with distinctly different types of hydrological exchange (infiltration, exfiltration, horizontal advection) to obtain samples of the fauna and the physicochemical and sedimentological conditions.Sixty taxa were identified, the most abundant of which were cyclopoid copepods (33%), ostracods (23%), and chironomids (11%). Total animal density patterns were strongly related to the ratio of particulate organic carbon to total fine particles (POC/TFP) which explained 63% of the variation in abundance within the sediment. Gradients in hyporheic community structure corresponded most to changes in POC/TFP, hydrological variables, and distance between the surface and groundwater habitats. Interstitial POC/TFP was determined mainly by the interaction between sediment depth and type of hydrological exchange in conjunction with season. The POC/TFP optima for individual taxa indicated that the depth to which epigean taxa penetrate sediments may be restricted by availability of the food resource, which decreases with decreasing POC/TFP, Therefore, the proportion of fine inorganic particles appears to be a critical determinant of the availability of food resources for interstitial invertebrates.Show less"

To understand this role through time and space, hydrogeochemical parameters, particularly nitrate concentrations (NO3-N), were measured monthly between February 2013 and April 2014 in surface water (SW), interstitial water (IW) and groundwater (GW) along a 170-km stretch from the river's source to the outlet into the main stream of the Tafna River and its Isser and Chouly tributaries. The significant longitudinal evolution of NO3-N in the HZ was related to stream order and distance from the source. Moreover, the study indicated a significant difference between nitrate concentrations in the riffles (R) and pools (P) of the Tafna wadi. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the considerable impact of agriculture on nitrate concentrations. This study indicated on a large scale that nitrate-rich HZ contributed to increasing surface nitrate concentrations in upwelling sites and could be an important nitrate source for downstream SW, particularly during low-water (LW) periods when the Tafna can run dry on the surface. Thus, these results underline the importance of hyporheic zones functioning to the water quality of the watershed (process of enrichment and retention of nitrogen).Show less"
25,"Knapp, JLA",Feb 2017 ,Tracer-based characterization of hyporheic exchange and benthic biolayers in streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Shallow benthic biolayers at the top of the streambed are believed to be places of enhanced biogeochemical turnover within the hyporheic zone. They can be investigated by reactive stream tracer tests with tracer recordings in the streambed and in the stream channel. Common in-stream measurements of such reactive tracers cannot localize where the processing primarily takes place, whereas isolated vertical depth profiles of solutes within the hyporheic zone are usually not representative of the entire stream. We present results of a tracer test where we injected the conservative tracer bromide together with the reactive tracer resazurin into a third-order stream and combined the recording of in-stream breakthrough curves with multidepth sampling of the hyporheic zone at several locations. The transformation of resazurin was used as an indicator of metabolism, and high-reactivity zones were identified from depth profiles. The results from our subsurface analysis indicate that the potential for tracer transformation (i.e., the reaction rate constant) varied with depth in the hyporheic zone. This highlights the importance of the benthic biolayer, which we found to be on average 2 cm thick in this study, ranging from one third to one half of the full depth of the hyporheic zone. The reach-scale approach integrated the effects of processes along the reach length, isolating hyporheic processes relevant for whole-stream chemistry and estimating effective reaction rates.Show less"

Hyporheic solute fluxes are commonly dominated by advective exchange. However, fluxes from the HZ also may include diffusion and upward advection of ground water from underlying aquifers. We compared the relative importance of these transport mechanisms on solute budgets of a large, spring-fed river in north-central Florida using measurements of spring, river, and porewater chemistry, hydraulic gradients, and sediment hydraulic conductivity, and dilution of an injected dye (Rhodamine WT). Downstream increases in Fe, soluble reactive P (SRP), Ca2+, and Cl- concentrations of the river water suggest solute sources in addition to the major source springs. Shallow porewater concentrations of Fe, Mn, Ca2+, SRP, and Cl- were elevated relative to the river. Calculations of Fickian diffusion based on concentration gradients of these solutes indicate diffusion could account for the downstream increase in Fe concentration but only 5% of the downstream increase in SRP and <0.1% of the increases in Ca2+ and Cl-. Downstream decreases in Mn concentrations reflect in-stream retention despite predicted diffusion. Dye-trace results indicate that approximate to 13% of the river discharge originates from sources other than the major springs. Measured head gradients and low sediment hydraulic conductivity suggest vertical groundwater flow through the HZ is small. We used the SRP budget to partition the additional groundwater inputs between seepage through the HZ (approximate to 3% of river discharge) and flow paths that bypass the HZ (approximate to 10% of total river discharge). Flow paths that bypass the HZ dominated additional water delivery to the river, but diffusion, resulting from steep chemical gradients and low-permeability sediments, is an important mechanism for transporting solutes from the HZ to the river.Show less"
27,"Harvey, J",Sep 2015 ,River corridor science: Hydrologic exchange and ecological consequences from bedforms to basins,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Previously regarded as the passive drains of watersheds, over the past 50 years, rivers have progressively been recognized as being actively connected with off-channel environments. These connections prolong physical storage and enhance reactive processing to alter water chemistry and downstream transport of materials and energy. Here we propose river corridor science as a concept that integrates downstream transport with lateral and vertical exchange across interfaces. Thus, the river corridor, rather than the wetted river channel itself, is an increasingly common unit of study. Main channel exchange with recirculating marginal waters, hyporheic exchange, bank storage, and overbank flow onto floodplains are all included under a broad continuum of interactions known as hydrologic exchange flows. Hydrologists, geomorphologists, geochemists, and aquatic and terrestrial ecologists are cooperating in studies that reveal the dynamic interactions among hydrologic exchange flows and consequences for water quality improvement, modulation of river metabolism, habitat provision for vegetation, fish, and wildlife, and other valued ecosystem services. The need for better integration of science and management is keenly felt, from testing effectiveness of stream restoration and riparian buffers all the way to reevaluating the definition of the waters of the United States to clarify the regulatory authority under the Clean Water Act. A major challenge for scientists is linking the small-scale physical drivers with their larger-scale fluvial and geomorphic context and ecological consequences. Although the fine scales of field and laboratory studies are best suited to identifying the fundamental physical and biological processes, that understanding must be successfully linked to cumulative effects at watershed to regional and continental scales.Show less"

The engineering of river ecological restoration can significantly change the hydrodynamics, as well as solute transport and reaction processes, but it is still not fully understood. In this study, nitrogen transport and reaction processes were analyzed in the HZ with an in-stream weir structure. An HZ model was built, and three reactions were considered with different design parameters of the weir structure and different permeability characteristics of porous media. The results show that a structure with a greater height on the overlying surface water enables the species to break through deeper porous media. It promotes the mean spatial reaction rates of nitrification and denitrification and results in increased net denitrification in most cases. In addition, increasing the burial depth of the structure leads to the same variation trends in the mean spatial reaction rates as increasing the structure height. Larger permeability coefficients in porous media can enhance flow exchange and increase mean spatial reaction rates. The results can help deepen the understanding of nitrogen transport and transformation in the HZ and optimize the design parameters and location of the in-stream structure.Show less"
29,"Kuriata-Potasznik, A",Dec 2021 ,Role of River-Lake System Sediments and Microbial Activity in the Hyporheic Zone,WATER,"The effect of river-lake systems on the surface water self-purification process is a significant and not fully recognised scientific issue. The conditions prevailing in the hyporheic zone of these ecosystems are of great importance in the process of component exchange between water and sediments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the type of sediments located at the bottom of the riverbed being part of a river-lake system on microbial activity in the hyporheic zone. An ex situ experiment was used to study the microbiological activity and the transformation of components in the collected river sediments. It was found that the specific properties of sediments varied depending on their location in the riverbed between the lakes comprising the system and that the prevailing meteorological conditions can also have an effect on microbial activity in the hyporheic zone, e.g., aerobic conditions. These conditions determined the intensity of component conversion in the sediments due to microbial metabolism. A closer understanding of the processes occurring in the hyporheic zone may allow the processes of water self-purification within river-lake systems to be supported in the future, which will contribute to the improvement of surface water quality.Show less"

Nevertheless, the factors that influence biotic communities along spatial and temporal gradients remain poorly understood. This study aimed to characterise the diversity and spatial pattern distribution of Cyclopoida and Ostracoda from the hyporheic zone in relation to the riverbed sediment structure and the quantity of organic matter in two second-order rivers in central Spain, whose alluvium is derived from materials of contrasting geology (siliceous vs. carbonates). Both streams were found to be characterised by marked habitat heterogeneity along the hyporheic flow path, as reflected by the different lithology, riverbed permeability and distinct hyporheic biota assemblages. The results indicate that the alluvium riverbeds dominated by carbonates rocks and associated with high permeable riverbeds had slightly diverse hyporheic assemblages (25 species in all) with species of mixed ecology (stygobites/stygophiles/stygoxenes). Conversely, the siliceous alluvium riverbeds with low mineralised waters, associated with reduced permeability and relatively less active surface/ground water exchanges, displayed slightly lower diversity (23 species) with assemblages exclusively composed of stygophiles/stygoxenes. The results highlight the role of the riverbed substratum for the hyporheic biota and provide forthcoming approaches for depicting surface subsurface hydrological exchanges.Show less"

In this paper, the surface water-groundwater coupling models of five wavy riverbed topographies were developed, and surface water velocity and pressure distribution under different wavy bed surface morphologies were studied. The upflows and downflows of sediment-water interface (SWI) were determined and quantified; in addition, the depth of hyporheic exchange and the locations of slow flow points were obtained. The obtained results showed that rippled bed morphologies disturbed the surface water flow field and separated adherent water flow at the water-sediment interface. The slope angle of water-slope of rippled beds was negatively correlated with the pressure of the water-sediment interface and positively correlated with flow velocity at the peak of the rippled bed. Upwelling and downwelling distributions basically depended on the geometry of the riverbed and did not change by changing the surface water velocity. The crest was a stable demarcation point between upflows and downflows, and the hyporheic exchange flux was negatively correlated with the angle of sloping slope. A stagnation zone existed in the hyporheic zone where both lateral and vertical flow velocity components approached zero, and its depth was similar to the depth of hyporheic zone. A lateral stagnation zone was located near the boundary of the reverse exchange zone in the hyporheic zone, and vertical stagnation zones were located on both sides of the maximum pressure of the water-sediment interface.Show less"
32,"Wang, WZ",Mar 2018 ,The influence of hyporheic upwelling fluxes on inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the pore water of the Weihe River,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Hyporheic zone is an important region of nitrogen removal in river systems. Hyporheic exchange generally leads to heterogeneous redox environments, which are conducive to nitrogen transformation. This study seeks to determine the influence of hyporheic upwelling fluxes on inorganic nitrogen (NH4+, NO3-, and NO2-) concentrations in the sediment pore water of the Weihe River, China. The patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange on 12 August 2016 were derived by a one-dimensional heat transport model, and inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the pore water, surface water, and groundwater were obtained. The results indicated that hyporheic water exchange was characterized by upwelling at each point during the test period. Moreover, NH4+ dominated the hyporheic zone from 0 to 45 cm, likely due to organic nitrogen mineralization. Additionally, a non-linear relationship was observed between NH4+ concentrations and upwelling fluxes. This relationship was derived by analyzing the effect of upwelling on biogeochemical activity and nitrogen transformation. Notably, increasing upwelling fluxes less than 400 mm/d resulted in high NH4+ concentrations, whereas fluxes exceeding 400 mm/d led to low NH4+ concentrations. Overall, the variations in inorganic nitrogen associated with hyporheic water exchange are of great importance for controlling nitrogen pollution and maintaining sustainable health in river systems.Show less"
33,"Singh, HV",Jun 2018 ,"Floodplain restoration increases hyporheic flow in the Yakima River Watershed, Washington",ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Hyporheic exchange between a river channel and its floodplain region assists in mediating processes such as nutrient removal and temperature regulation. Floodplain restoration in the form of levee setbacks are often carried out to improve the hyporheic exchange. In this study Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were used along with the head data from observation wells and stage data from rivers to setup and calibrate a groundwater model for 458 km(2) of area within Gap to Gap reach of the Yakima River, WA. This area has witnessed several efforts of floodplain restoration in the form of levee setbacks. The groundwater model was used to quantify hyporheic flow emerging from the Yakima River in steady and transient states during pre-restoration (using LiDAR data of 2008) and post-restoration period (after levee setback using LiDAR data of 2013). The comparison of results from the model runs during pre and post-restoration periods showed that the length of the pathlines increased after levee setback for both steady and transient state model simulations. The largest increase of about 62 m was noticed in the month of September 2014 (pre: 398 m and post: 460 m). The study also showed that the direction of the flow changed following levee setback, expanding the area for hyporheic flux exchange between surface and groundwater. The model run during transient state also suggested that pathlines were longer during drier months compared to wet months. Overall, the study showed that levee setbacks improved the hyporheic connection between surface and groundwater in the Yakima floodplain which demonstrates that levee setback can provide a valuable hydrologic tool to restore ecosystem processes in previously leveed rivers.Show less"

However, the supporting evidence is unclear, especially regarding the survival of hyporheic refugees and their contribution to the recovery of post-disturbance populations. Moreover, few studies have focused on the importance of the hyporheic refuge for aquatic vertebrates such as fish. In this study, we present evidence that the hyporheic zone acts as a refuge for a small benthic fish (Cobitis shikokuensis) following surface drying in an intermittent river. We examined its survival during and recolonization after dry periods by direct hyporheic sampling and mark-and-recapture surveys. When the streambed dried, hyporheic sampling was conducted 58 times across 33 locations in the intermittent reach and 31 individuals of C. shikokuensis were captured from extracted hyporheic water. Mark-and-recapture surveys revealed that recolonizers after re-wetting included C. shikokuensis individuals that had survived dry periods in the hyporheic refuge. The condition factor of C. shikokuensis significantly declined after dry periods, suggesting that most recolonizers suffered from physiological stress, probably within the hyporheic refuge. These results clearly support the long-debated, hyporheic refuge hypothesis, and provide a striking example of the critical role of the hyporheic zone in population maintenance of lotic organisms.Show less"

Despite having low settling velocities, these particles can leave suspension during downstream transport by a series of processes such as hyporheic filtration, flocculation, and biofilm entrapment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the retention of clay particles within a stream reach due to streambed filtration. To this end, we quantify hyporheic exchange through coupled formulations of turbulent surface water flow in the overlying stream and saturated groundwater flow in the streambed. Particle filtration models are informed by flow-through column experiments conducted with repacked streambed material. Results of our model simulations of hyporheic exchange demonstrate that streambed particle filtration depends on overlying streamflow and, to a lesser extent, on hyporheic zone substrate. Retention of suspended particles within the streambed sediments more than doubles between high and drought flows and varies by less than 45% across substrate grain size classes.Show less"

Field measurements and numerical simulations show the formation of a low-permeability layer (LPL) near the bed surface due to fine particle clogging, and consequently reduction of exchange fluxes between the bed and river water. A characteristic porosity (epsilon*) and time scale were derived to quantify the clogging process and effects on transport. Both the exchange flux and mean solute residence time were found to follow a power law relationship with epsilon*. For the normalized particle exchange flux, the exponent is close to unity, i.e., a linear relationship with epsilon*. The results also showed significant effects of the fine particle concentration, pressure difference, sediment collision efficiency and fine particle diameter on the bed clogging. Large values of these parameters led to intensified clogging, with the formation of different types of LPL.Show less"
37,"Mouw, JEB",Oct 2009 ,INFLUENCES OF FLOODING AND HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE ON FLOODPLAIN PLANT RICHNESS AND PRODUCTIVITY,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Flooding disturbance and associated fluvial processes are generally thought to be the primary controls on floodplain species richness patterns. We expanded this idea to include ground and surface water (hyporheic) exchange within alluvial flood plains. At the floodplain scale, we hypothesized that upwelling areas would be richer in species and support higher growth rates of woody plants. At reaches within each flood plain, we evaluated the mechanisms of flood duration, patterns in sedimentation and driftwood as influences. We found patterns of species richness within the shifting mosaic of floodplain wetland habitats to be incoherent with flood duration for large flood plains on the Flathead and Talkeetna Rivers. Rather, species richness was closely associated with hyporheic exchange at the floodplain scale and locally with alluvial particle size. Species richness was highest in areas of both flood plains characterized by upwelling groundwater. On annually scoured surfaces, richness was affected by large wood debris that reduced flow competence, allowing fine sediment deposition and plant establishment. Richness within upwelling and downwelling reaches was highest at sites with the finest alluvia.Growth rates of woody species used as indices of site productivity were also significantly higher at areas characterized by upwelling. We concluded that plant species richness was strongly controlled by hyporheic exchange at the floodplain scale and locally by the deposition of fine alluvia. This interpretation was not consistent with intermediate levels of flood disturbance. Indeed, areas of the flood plain least influenced by flow energy had the highest richness on both flood plains.

Hyporheic processes have been well-documented in surface water-groundwater mixing zones underlying and directly adjacent to streams. Alluvial aquifers underlying meander necks provide a further extension of the hyporheic zone. Hydraulic head and temperature data, collected from a set of wells across a meander neck, show stream water moves through the meander neck. The hydraulic gradient across the meander neck (0.006) is greater than the stream gradient (0.003) between the same points, driving the bypass. Rapid subsurface response to elevated stream stage shows a hydraulic connection between the stream and the alluvial aquifer. Temperature data and a Peclet number (Pe) of 43.1 indicate that thermal transport is dominated by advection from the upstream side to the downstream side of the meander neck. The temperature observed within the alluvial aquifer correlates with seasonal temperature variation. Together, the pressure and temperature data indicate that water moves across the meander neck. The inflow of stream water through the meander neck suggests that the meander system may host biogeochemical hyporheic zone processes.Show less"

Empirically parameterized and calibrated groundwater flow models were used to assess the influence of sub-channel thaw on hyporheic exchange. Average thaw depths were at least two-fold greater under the higher-energy, alluvial stream than under the low-energy, peat-lined stream. Alluvial hyporheic exchange had shorter residence times and longer flowpaths that occurred across greater portions of the thawed sediments. For both reaches, the morphologic (longitudinal bed topography) and hydraulic conditions (surface and groundwater flow properties) set the potential for hyporheic flow. Simulations of deeper thaw, as predicted under a warming arctic climate, only influence hyporheic exchange until a threshold depth. This depth is primarily determined by the hydraulic head gradients imposed by the stream morphology. Therefore, arctic hyporheic exchange extent is likely to be independent of greater sub-stream thaw depths.Show less"

We performed four whole-stream solute tracer injections under steady state flow conditions at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, United States) and collected electrical resistivity (ER) imaging to directly quantify the 2-D spatial extent of hyporheic exchange through seasonal base flow recession. ER images provide spatially distributed information that is unavailable for stream solute transport modeling studies from monitoring wells alone. The lateral and vertical extent of the hyporheic zone was quantified using both ER images and spatial moment analysis. Results oppose the common conceptual model of hyporheic ""compression'' by increased lateral hydraulic gradients toward the stream. We found that the extent of the hyporheic zone increased with decreasing vertical gradients away from the stream, in contrast to expectations from conceptual models. Increasing hyporheic extent was observed with both increasing and decreasing down-valley (i.e., parallel to the valley gradient) and cross-valley (i.e., from the hillslope to the stream, perpendicular to the valley gradient) hydraulic gradients. We conclude that neither cross-valley nor down-valley hydraulic gradients are sufficient predictors of hyporheic exchange flux nor flow path network extent. Increased knowledge of the controls on hyporheic exchange, the temporal dynamics of exchange flow paths, and their the spatial distribution is the first step toward predicting hyporheic exchange at the scale of individual flow paths. Future studies need to more carefully consider interactions between spatiotemporally dynamic hydraulic gradients and subsurface architecture as controls on hyporheic exchange.Show less"

Mussel populations vary from high to low density downstream of Kinzua Dam, and the direction, amount, and range of hyporheic exchange (seepage) at the sediment-water interface were suspected to influence their distribution and abundance. Nineteen hydrogeomorphic variables, including the quantification of seepage metrics, substrate size, river stage, river discharge, and shear stress, were measured at five reaches on the Allegheny River within 80km downstream of Kinzua Dam. Analysis revealed significant (=005) non-linear correlations between mussel population density and directional mean seepage (positive relationship), river width (positive relationship), and median substrate size (negative relationship). Specifically, seepage findings showed that increases in upward seepage and decreases in the overall range of seepage related to increases in mussel population density. River width, directional mean seepage, and median substrate size were also found to co-vary with marginal significance (=01), making their individual influences on mussel population density uncertain. Absolute mean seepage, water depth, hydraulic head, temperature differences between the surface water and substrate, and other substrate metrics besides median grain size were not found to significantly correlate to mussel population density. Considering the physical processes often linking seepage to other explanatory variables, future research in seepage-mussel relationships should work to isolate the mechanistic influence of hyporheic exchange independently from its common covariation with substrate size and geomorphology.

42,"Wu, LW",Mar 2020 ,Impact of Flow Alteration and Temperature Variability on Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Coupled groundwater flow and heat transport within hyporheic zones extensively affect water, energy, and solute exchange with surrounding sediments. The local and cumulative implications of this tightly coupled process strongly depend on characteristics of drivers (i.e., discharge and temperature of the water column) and modulators (i.e., hydraulic and thermal properties of the sediment). With this in mind, we perform a systematic numerical analysis of hyporheic responses to understand how the temporal variability of river discharge and temperature affect flow and heat transport within hyporheic zones. We identify typical time series of river discharge and temperature from gauging stations along the headwater region of Mississippi River Basin, which are characterized by different degrees of flow alteration, to drive a physics-based model of the hyporheic exchange process. Our modeling results indicate that coupled groundwater flow and heat transport significantly affects the dynamic response of hyporheic zones, resulting in substantial differences in exchange rates and characteristic time scales of hyporheic exchange processes. We also find that the hyporheic zone dampens river temperature fluctuations increasingly with higher frequency of temperature fluctuations. This dampening effect depends on the system transport time scale and characteristics of river discharge and temperature variability. Furthermore, our results reveal that the flow alteration reduces the potential of hyporheic zones to act as a temperature buffer and hinders denitrification within hyporheic zones. These results have significant implications for understanding the drivers of local variability in hyporheic exchange and the implications for the development of thermal refugia and ecosystem functioning in hyporheic zones.Show less"
43,"Zheng, LZ",Sep 2018 ,Diel Stream Temperature Effects on Nitrogen Cycling in Hyporheic Zones,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Stream temperature often varies diurnally and seasonally, and these variations propagate into hyporheic zones (HZs), forming dynamic and heterogeneous thermal patterns. The complex thermal distribution creates potential biogeochemical hotspots and hot moments. Yet, how diel temperature variations affect HZ nitrogen cycling is unknown. We thus conducted a series of multiphysics numerical simulations of nonisothermal fluid flow and multicomponent reactive solute transport to investigate this problem. We imposed a sinusoidally varying stream temperature representing diel warming and cooling and studied the effects of different temperature means and amplitudes on HZ nitrate removal efficiency inside a streambed with a dune. The results showed that the time-variable nitrification, denitrification, and nitrate removal efficiency responded differently to the diel stream temperature signal. The temporal variation of spatially averaged nitrification rate tracks the stream temperature signal, whereas the spatially averaged denitrification variation pattern has a more complex connection to temperature. We observed a persistent hotspot where significant denitrification rates are present over the 24-hr period. We further evaluated and estimated the bulk nitrate removal efficiency calculated by time integration of spatially averaged reaction rates over a day. For denitrification-dominant systems, the bulk nitrate removal efficiency for cases with dynamic stream temperature was effectively the same as those with an equivalent constant mean temperature. Therefore, the bulk removal efficiency of a thermally dynamic diel system may be represented by an equivalent isothermal system given stable flow conditions. However, since large instantaneous variations in various rates were observed, the results imply that randomly timed field measurements are unlikely to be representative. This has to be considered for both past and future synoptic observational studies.Stream temperature naturally varies over daily and seasonal periods. This could cause temperature-dependent chemical and biological processes to vary simultaneously. Within the permeable streambed are areas called hyporheic zones where stream water circulates through in and out of the bed. The heat carried by this hyporheic flow that originates from the stream forms dynamic and complex temperature distributions in the hyporheic zone. The thermal patterns within the streambed could determine the presence of denitrification hotspots and hot moments since the hyporheic zone is an important site for many chemical reactions including nitrogen cycling. Through modeling the flow and reaction transport processes within the hyporheic zone, we found that denitrification hotspots persisted despite dynamic and complex hyporheic zone thermal patterns. Our simulation results can help explain previous observations of warmer stream temperature corresponding to lower in-stream nitrate concentrations. The results also imply that instantaneous snapshots through synoptic chemical sampling or reaction rate quantification may not be representative since the results and interpretations from such sampling strategies will depend on the time the samples were taken. Despite exploring a large range of modeled instantaneous variations of stream temperature, the results show that the steady, mean temperature can be used to estimate the bulk nitrate removal efficiency of the hyporheic zone.Show less"

The hyporheic zone plays a key role in hydrological exchange and biogeochemical processes in streambed sediments. The clogging of sediments caused by the deposition of particles in the bed of streams and rivers can decrease sediment permeability and hence greatly affect hyporheic microbial processes.2. The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of sediment clogging on hyporheic microbial processes in three French rivers (the Usses, Drome and Isere). In each river, microbial abundance and activity were studied at three depths (10, 30 and 50 cm) in the sediment at one unclogged (high porosity) and one clogged site (low porosity).3. The results showed that the sediment clogging had inconsistent effects on microbial processes in the three rivers. Increases (Usses) or decreases (Drome and Isere) in both aerobic and anaerobic processes were detected at the clogged sites compared to unclogged sites. These results suggest that microbial changes because of the sediment clogging are mainly mediated by the residence time of water within the hyporheic sediments.4. A single model predicting the effect of clogging on hyporheic microbial processes cannot be applied generally to all rivers because the degree of clogging creates heterogeneous effects on flow rates between surface and interstitial waters. As a consequence, the influence of heterogeneous clogging on surface water-hyporheic exchanges needs to be evaluated by water tracing and hydraulic modelling to determine the links between microbial processes and hydraulic heterogeneity induced by clogging in hyporheic sediments.Show less"
45,"Knust, AE",Apr 15 2009 ,"Using a fluctuating tracer to estimate hyporheic exchange in restored and unrestored reaches of the Truckee River, Nevada, USA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The goal of this research was to compare hyporheic activity in recently restored and adjacent un-restored reaches of the Truckee River downstream from the Reno/Sparks metropolitan area. The installation of rocky riffles and raised channel bed elevations in the restored reaches may have increased the degree of surface-subsurface interaction. A fluctuating chloride concentration signal served as the tracer, induced by the variable influx of higher salinity water several miles upstream from the Study reach. The solute transport model, OTIS, was used ill Conjunction with the hydrodynamic model. DYNHYD5, to estimate transient storage parameters under unsteady flow conditions. The model was calibrated to chloride concentrations measured over a period of three days at six in-stream locations representing restored and un-restored reaches. An automated parameter estimation algorithm (SCE-UA) Was used to optimize parameters for multiple reaches simultaneously and generate a distribution of parameter estimates. Results Suggest that the transient storage zone cross-sectional area (A(s)) is larger in the restored reaches than in the unrestored reaches, but the exchange coefficient (alpha) is smaller, leading to increased hyporheic residence time and hydrologic retention in the vicinity of channel reconstructions. Scenarios were used to simulate the potential effects of increased subsurface residence time oil denitrification and in-stream NO3-N concentrations. Monte Carlo analysis was performed to assess uncertainty in the simulation results and show the potential for greater nutrient retention ill the lower Truckee River as a result of channel restoration.

46,"Wohl, E",Jan 15 2017 ,Mapping longitudinal stream connectivity in the North St. Vrain Creek watershed of Colorado,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"We use reach-scale stream gradient as an indicator of longitudinal connectivity for water, sediment, and organic matter in a mountainous watershed in Colorado. Stream reaches with the highest gradient tend to have narrow valley bottoms with limited storage space and attenuation of downstream fluxes, whereas stream reaches with progressively lower gradients have progressively more storage and greater attenuation. We compared the distribution of stream gradient to stream-reach connectivity rankings that incorporated multiple potential control variables, including lithology, upland vegetation, hydroclimatology, road crossings, and flow diversions. We then assessed connectivity rankings using different weighting schemes against stream gradient and against field based understanding of relative connectivity within the watershed. We conclude that stream gradient, which is simple to map using publicly available data and digital elevation models, is the most robust indicator of relative longitudinal connectivity within the river network.

47,"Czuba, JA",Mar 2019 ,Dynamics of Surface-Water Connectivity in a Low-Gradient Meandering River Floodplain,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"High-resolution topography reveals that floodplains along meandering rivers in Indiana commonly contain intermittently flowing channel networks. We investigated how the presence of floodplain channels affects lateral surface-water connectivity between a river and floodplain (specifically exchange flux and timescales of transport) as a function of flow stage in a low-gradient river-floodplain system. We constructed a two-dimensional, surface-water hydrodynamic model using Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) 2D along 32km of floodplain (56km along the river) of the East Fork White River near Seymour, Indiana, USA, using lidar elevation data and surveyed river bathymetry. The model was calibrated using land-cover specific roughness to elevation-discharge data from a U.S. Geological Survey gage and validated against high-water marks, an aerial photo showing the spatial extent of floodplain inundation, and measured flow velocities. Using the model results, we analyzed the flow in the river, spatial patterns of inundation, flow pathways, river-floodplain exchange, and water residence time on the floodplain. Our results highlight that bankfull flow is an oversimplified concept for explaining river-floodplain connectivity because some stream banks are overtopped and major low-lying floodplain channels are inundated roughly 19days per year. As flow increased, inundation of floodplain channels at higher elevations dissected the floodplain, until the floodplain channels became fully inundated. Additionally, we found that river-floodplain exchange was driven by bank height or channel orientation depending on flow conditions. We propose a conceptual model of river-floodplain connectivity dynamics and developed metrics to analyze quantitatively complex river-floodplain systems.Show less"
48,"Chen, XB",Apr 2015 ,Three-dimensional versus two-dimensional bed form-induced hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone is often a critical component of river systems. Hyporheic exchange is generally forced by variation in riverbed topography such as due to bed forms. Most previous research on bed form-driven hyporheic flow has focused on two-dimensional (2-D) dunes and ripples, while little has been done on their three-dimensional (3-D) counterparts. Here we compared hyporheic exchange and associated metrics for a previously studied pair of corresponding 2-D and 3-D bed forms. To accomplish this, a series of multiphysics computational fluid dynamics models were conducted both in 2-D and 3-D with similar open channel Reynolds numbers (Re). Results show that the pressure gradient along the sediment-water interface is highly sensitive to the spatial structure of bed forms, which consequently determines hyporheic flow dynamics. Hyporheic flux is a function of Re for both 2-D and 3-D dunes via a power law; however, the equivalent 3-D dunes have a higher flux since the 3-D form induces more drag. The hyporheic zone depths and volumes are only slightly different with the 3-D case having a larger volume. The mean fluid residence times for both cases are related to Re by an inverse power law relationship, with the 3-D dune having smaller residence times at moderate to high Re. The effects of increasing flux on residence time in 3-D dunes are partly modulated by a slightly increasing hyporheic volume. Our results suggest that a 2-D idealization is a reasonable approximation for the more complex 3-D situation if local details are unimportant but that development of predictive models for mean fluxes and residence times, which are critical for biogeochemical processes, based on 2-D models may be insufficient.Show less"
49,"Peterson, EW",Oct 15 2008 ,High frequency stream bed mobility of a low-gradient agricultural stream with implications on the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Little Kickapoo Creek (LKC), a low-gradient stream, mobilizes its streambed-fundamentally altering its near-surface hypoheic zone-more frequently than do higher-gradient mountain and karst streams. LKC streamed mobility was assessed through streamed surveys, sediments sampling, and theoretical calculations comparing basal shear stress (tau(b)) with critical shear stress (tau(b)). Baseflow tau(b) is capable of entraining a d(50) particle; bankfull flow could entrain a 51.2 mm particle. No particle that large occurs in the top 30 cm of the substrate, suggesting that the top 30 cm of the substrate is mobilized and redistributed during bankfull events. Bankfull events occur every 7.6 months; flows capable of entraining d(50) and d(85) particles occur on average every 0.85 and 2.1 months, respectively. Streamed surveys verify streamed mobility at conditions below bankfull. While higher gradient streams have higher potential energy that LKC, they achieve streamed-mobilization thersholds less frequently. Heterogenous sediments redistribution creates an environment where substrate hydraulic conductivity (K) varies over four orders of magnitude. The frequency and magnitude of the substrate entrainment has implication on hyporheic zone function in fluid, solute and thermal transport models, interpretations of hyporheic zone stability, and understanding of LKC's aquatic ecosystem.
