1,"Bai, T",Mar 15 2021 ,Seawater exchange rates for harbors based on the use of MIKE21 coupled with transport and particle tracking models,JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION,"The water self-purification capacities of coastal areas can be affected by the extension of adjacent harbors. Studies of the seawater exchange capacities of harbors are viewed as an important index and means of protecting coastal water environments. In this paper, the MIKE21 hydrodynamic model (HD) is established and coupled with the transport model (TR) and particle tracking model (PT). Taking the Budai Harbor of Chiayi County along the southwestern coast of Taiwan as an example, five scenarios of upstream river inflow and corresponding pollutant distributions are explored. The tidal exchange rates (TER) of the five scenarios are quantitatively calculated. The results show the following: (1) Water exchange and self-purification capacities of the coastal area are stronger than those of other areas of the wetland region. (2) The self-purification capacities of the wetland are improved close to estuary due to upstream inflows. (3) With an increase in upstream flows, the wetland TER increases from 0.85 to 0.95, showing that inflows improve the water exchange capacity of the wetland. These have results applications for quantifying the influence of engineering construction in coastal areas close to harbors, for revealing the rates of seawater exchange that govern areas within and outside of harbors.Show less"
2,"Song, XH",Jul 2021 ,Scale-dependent spatial variabilities of hydrological exchange flows and transit time in a large regulated river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrological exchange flows (HEFs) across the river-aquifer interface and the associated transit time of river water in the aquifer have important implications for contaminant plume migration and biogeochemical processes in the river corridor. HEFs and transit time are influenced by both subsurface physical features and hydrologic forcing related to the transport process, which can exhibit complex spatial and temporal variations. In this study, we used a massively parallel subsurface flow model and a particle-tracking model to study the influences of different control factors on spatial variability of HEFs and transit time distributions in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington State. 100 million particles were randomly injected in time and space and then tracked in a model domain that covers a 51-km(2) area (15.1million model cells). We used hourly river stages and groundwater levels to drive the model to provide dynamic velocity fields for the particle tracking in the two + -year simulation period. The groundwater flow simulation and particle-tracking results provide a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of HEFs and transit time in a large, complex river corridor. Our results show that the aquifer hydrogeological structure has strong correlations with the extent and magnitude of exchange flux. The transit time exhibits complex patterns that are affected by all the river geomorphologic, hydrodynamic, and hydrogeologic factors and are strongly correlated with the downwelling ratio of exchange flux. The new insights gained through this study can be used to support the development of reduced-order models of HEFs and transit time distributions for large complex river systems.Show less"
3,"Reuter, CN",Jan 2019 ,"Fish Assemblage Response to Altered Dendritic Connectivity in the Red River Basin, Central Louisiana",AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST,"Louisiana's streams provide habitat for a diversity of ecologically and economically important fish species. However, most stream systems in the state have been subject to substantial anthropogenic alterations related to municipal, agricultural, and forest resource development. Extensive reservoir construction has also resulted in altered dendritic connectivity in many drainages, which has been shown to significantly alter the function and biodiversity of streams throughout the U.S. This study explored interactions among stream connectivity, watershed characteristics, stream physicochemistry, and fish assemblage composition and abundance in 21 headwater streams within the Red River basin of Louisiana, with half flowing directly into a reservoir. In 2014 and 2015, fish were sampled by electrofishing and seining, and habitats and physicochemistry were characterized. Six fish species were exclusively found in reservoir streams, three fish species were only found in river tributaries, seven fish species were more abundant in river tributaries, and all richness metrics (total, stream specialist, and generalist) calculated for seined fishes were higher in river tributaries. Notably, Grass Pickerel (Esox americanus) was more abundant in river tributaries. Because of its potential role as an obligate glochidial host for the Louisiana Pearlshell Mussel (Margrnitifera hembelt), the influence of stream fragmentation on Grass Pickerel may have significant implications regarding conservation of this endangered mussel. Our results parallel trends observed in similar studies indicating decreased species richness and abundance in streams truncated by reservoirs.Show less"

6,"Preziosi-Ribero, A",Feb 2020 ,Fine Sediment Deposition and Filtration Under Losing and Gaining Flow Conditions: A Particle Tracking Model Approach,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Fine particle deposition within riverbeds plays a major role in riverine ecology and biogeochemistry by altering hyporheic exchange flux. Moreover, it is ubiquitous within streams and rivers across all flow stages. However, the dynamics of fine particle deposition are still not completely understood in rivers, and continuum models like the advection dispersion equation require modifications to represent the processes accurately. To enhance understanding of fine particle dynamics, we developed a novel numerical particle tracking model that simulates fine particle deposition as a stochastic process under losing, neutral, and gaining streamflow conditions. These flow conditions generate three different velocity profiles by combining the free surface and groundwater flows. In addition, a novel aspect of our model is the storage of filtered particles to estimate concentration fields within the bed. Our simulated results are qualitatively compared with previous laboratory flume experimental results of kaolinite deposition under similar conditions. The model indicates that fine particle deposition patterns and residence time functions depend heavily on the exchange flux between stream and groundwater, as well as bed filtration properties as the deposition of particles occurs at greater depths in the losing stream condition than in the neutral and gaining cases. Therefore, the spatial pattern of particle deposition is a direct result of pore water velocity profiles, while the concentration depends on filtration dynamics within the bed.Show less"
7,"Timbadiya, PV",Feb 2015 ,A 1D-2D Coupled Hydrodynamic Model for River Flood Prediction in a Coastal Urban Floodplain,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"In this work, a one dimensional-two dimensional (1D-2D) coupled hydrodynamic model is developed for prediction of water levels in the lower Tapi River and its coastal urban floodplain (Surat city in Gujarat, India). A one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic model, calibrated for the 1998 flood, is coupled with a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model of an urban floodplain with due consideration of the upstream (releases from Ukai reservoir) and downstream (tidal level of the sea) boundary conditions. The resistance coefficient for the floodplain is estimated using satellite imagery based on the land use and land cover pattern. The coupled hydrodynamic model is validated with independent data for flooding in the year 2006 and is used to develop a stage-discharge curve along the lower Tapi River for computation of the stream power during the flood. The methodology for river flood prediction on a coastal urban floodplain using the 1D-2D coupled hydrodynamic model is generic and can be applied to similar geographical conditions.

8,"Saeedpanah, I",Feb 2019 ,Solution of Unsteady Flow in a Confined Aquifer Interacting with a Stream with Exponentially Decreasing Stream Stage,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The solution of interactions between groundwater and surface water provides good insight into the mechanism of these water resources. Considering groundwater as a significant source of irrigation and a main freshwater supply for agricultural purposes, a stream-aquifer system is studied to investigate the groundwater level and flow direction. The solution is obtained and applicable for streams fully penetrating the aquifer. The system is solved and a set of expressions for computing level and exchange in the aquifer are derived by means of the Laplace transformation technique, wherein the right end of the aquifer is a constant head boundary and the stream stage at the left boundary decreases exponentially with time. A broad range of sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of variations in aquifer parameters on groundwater head. Aquifer response for exponential and sudden drops in stream stage is investigated. A useful expression describing the relation of stream stage variation rate and volumetric exchange is found, which clarifies whether the final volumetric exchange is negative, zero, or positive. For a sudden drop in stream stage, a water divide takes place in the aquifer and therefore flow reversal occurs at the water divide position. It is shown that how and how much the position of the water divide changes depends on changes in aquifer parameters. In addition, it is observed that groundwater level stabilization occurs relatively faster in aquifers with a greater hydraulic conductivity, smaller specific storage, or smaller length.Show less"
9,"Calles, EO",Nov 2005 ,Evaluation of nature-like fishways for re-establishing connectivity in fragmented salmonid populations in the River Eman,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"We evaluated the function of two nature-like fishways for re-establishing connectivity for anadromous salmonids in the regulated River Eman. Between 90 and 100% of the salmonids that entered the fishways actually passed through them, with median speeds of 180-190 m h(-1). Only 50% of the anadromous brown trout that passed the first fishway also passed the second one, indicating that the fish might have had problems locating the upstream fishway. The fishways were also observed to function as a passage for downstream post-spawning migrants. The densities of brown trout yearlings upstream of the fishways were higher in 2002, after the fishways were built, than during pre-fishway years. In control sites in other parts of the river as well as in a nearby river, no changes in yearling densities were observed. Thus, the fishways are working for upstream spawners, albeit at a recolonization rate that is slower than expected. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
10,"Malard, F",Apr 2003 ,Influence of groundwater upwelling on the distribution of the hyporheos in a headwater river flood plain,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"We examined the influence of groundwater upwelling on the distribution of the hyporheic fauna in a 2.6-km long glacial flood plain, the downstream part of which behaved as a major groundwater upwelling zone. Hyporheic water and invertebrates were collected during the four different phases of the expansion-contraction cycle at a depth of 30cm in the bed sediment of 28 channels. Multivariate methods and analysis of variance were used to test for differences in the concentration of nutrients and composition of the hyporheos between the upstream and downstream parts of the flood plain. The large scale groundwater upwelling flow pattern maintained permanent flow conditions in the lower flood plain but had no detectable influence on temperature and nutrient concentrations of shallow hyporheic water. In contrast, the density and taxonomic richness of hyporheic assemblages were distinctly higher in the upwelling zone, essentially because of an increase in the number and density of taxa belonging to the permanent hyporheos and true groundwater fauna. The longitudinal pattern of hyporheic assemblages remained remarkably stable over the four different phases of the expansion-contraction cycle. We concluded that the strength of hydrological connections between ground water and surface water had a major influence on hyporheic biodiversity by controlling not only the degree of flow permanency but also the recolonization pathways of organisms inhabiting streambed sediments.Show less"

15,"Rudorff, CM",Jan 2018 ,Recent increase of river-floodplain suspended sediment exchange in a reach of the lower Amazon River,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"We analyzed variation of channel-floodplain suspended sediment exchange along a 140km reach of the lower Amazon River for two decades (1995-2014). Daily sediment fluxes were determined by combining measured and estimated surface sediment concentrations with river-floodplain water exchanges computed with a two-dimensional hydraulic model. The average annual inflow to the floodplain was 4088 +/- 2017 Gg yr(-1) and the outflow was 2251 +/- 471 Gg yr(-1), respectively. Prediction of average sediment accretion rate was twice the estimate from a previous study of this same reach and more than an order of magnitude lower than an estimate from an earlier regional scale study. The amount of water routed through the floodplain, which is sensitive to levee topography and increases exponentially with river discharge, was the main factor controlling the variation in total annual sediment inflow. Besides floodplain routing, the total annual sediment export depended on the increase in sediment concentration in lakes during floodplain drainage. The recent increasing amplitude of the Amazon River annual flood over two decades has caused a substantial shift in water and sediment river-floodplain exchanges. In the second decade (2005-2014), as the frequency of extreme floods increased, annual sediment inflow increased by 81% and net storage increased by 317% in relation to the previous decade (1995-2004).

16,"Sheshjavani, AG",Mar 2017 ,An adaptive buffer-map exchange mechanism for pull-based peer-to-peer video-on-demand streaming systems,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,"Unlike P2P live video streaming in which all the peers in a channel watch a video with tiny differences in viewing points, in P2P video on demand (VoD) streaming systems, neighbor peers may watch the same video with more different viewing points; therefore, using push-based approach is not efficient for such systems, and the overhead of the pull-based approaches is challenging due to the periodical exchange of buffer-maps among the peers. In pull-based P2P VoD systems, to achieve better quality of experience it is necessary to use large buffers at the peers that results in more buffer-maps exchange overhead. In this paper, we study buffer-map exchange challenging in pull-based P2P VoD streaming systems and propose an adaptive mechanism for decreasing overhead by sending the buffer-maps with regard to the viewing points of the peers. Bandwidth overhead of the proposed mechanism is independent of the used buffer sizes and is less dependent to the buffer-map exchange period. By using this effective mechanism, better quality of service can be achieved through using large buffers at the peers, without increasing in the overhead. Our simulation based performance evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in decreasing the bandwidth overhead of buffer-map exchange in P2P VoD streaming systems.Show less"
17,"Falke, JA",Sep-oct 2011 ,"The role of groundwater pumping and drought in shaping ecological futures for stream fishes in a dryland river basin of the western Great Plains, USA",ECOHYDROLOGY,"Across the western Great Plains of North America, groundwater pumping for irrigated agriculture is depleting regional aquifers that sustain streamflow for native fishes. We investigated linkages between groundwater pumping from the High Plains Aquifer and stream fish habitat loss at multiple spatial scales during spring and summer 2005-2007 in the Arikaree River, eastern Colorado, USA. Monthly low-altitude flights showed that flowing reaches were reduced from about 65 to <= 15 km by late summer, and long permanently dry segments in the lower basin prevent recolonization. Drying occurred rapidly during summer within three 6.4-km river segments, and patterns in habitat connectivity varied among segments owing to hydraulic conductivity. Most refuge pool habitats dried completely or lost more than half their volume, disconnecting from other pools by late summer. On the basis of these empirical habitat data, and historical groundwater and streamflow data, we constructed a MODFLOW model to predict how groundwater pumping will affect water table levels and fish habitat under three future scenarios. Under the most conservative scenario, we predicted that only 57% of refuge pools will remain in 35 years (2045), nearly all isolated in a 1.7-km fragment of river. A water balance model indicated that maintaining current water table levels and refuge pools for fishes would require a 75% reduction in groundwater pumping, which is not economically or politically feasible. Given widespread streamflow declines, ecological futures are bleak for stream fishes in the western Great Plains, and managers will be challenged to conserve native fishes under current groundwater pumping regimes.

18,"Troni, N",2021 ,Water Quality Examination in the Stream Sediment of River Sitnica - the Assessment of Toxic Trace Elements,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"It is presently well-recognized that the contamination of aquatic sediments in Kosovo is a widespread phenomenon. The observation of the chemical analyses of water and sediments is essential to determine the extent of trace elements in these ecosystems. Hence, in order to be able to determine the mass concentration of the predominant elements present in river Sitnica, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was used for this research. Moreover, a comparison of the mass concentration of water elements with the mass concentration of the elements found in the Sitnica sediments was provided. Utilizing the results obtained from the ICP-MS analysis, it was shown that the mass concentration of nickel, arsenic, zinc, cadmium, lead, copper, aluminum in certain water sample stations exceeds the permissible sediment quality criteria. Considering the toxicity that heavy metals exert on the aquatic environment, this research aimed to assess and measure the metal toxicity, because only then, a proper solution can be suggested to sustain freshwater ecosystems and to prevent constant damage from the human activity.Show less"

Therefore, models that seek to characterize stream temperatures, and predict their changes due to landscape and climatic changes, are extremely important. In this study, we extend a mechanistic stream temperature model within the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) by explicitly incorporating radiative flux components to more realistically account for radiative heat exchange. The extended stream temperature model is particularly useful for simulating the impacts of landscape and land use change on stream temperatures using SWAT. The extended model is tested for the Marys River, a western tributary of the Willamette River in Oregon. The results are compared with observed stream temperatures, as well as previous model estimates (without radiative components), for different spatial locations within the Marys River watershed. The results show that the radiative stream temperature model is able to simulate increased stream temperatures in agricultural sub-basins compared with forested sub-basins, reflecting observed data. However, the effect is overestimated, and more noise is generated in the radiative model due to the inclusion of highly variable radiative forcing components. The model works at a daily time step, and further research should investigate modeling at hourly timesteps to further improve the temporal resolution of the model. In addition, other watersheds should be tested to improve and validate the model in different climates, landscapes, and land use regimes.Show less"

22,"Papazekou, M",Jun 2022 ,A river-based approach in reconstructing connectivity among protected areas: Insights and challenges from the Balkan region,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,"Global efforts to halt biodiversity loss mandate the establishment of protected areas. In the face of habitat loss and climate uncertainty, large-scale networks of protected areas connected by corridors are needed to increase the dispersal and persistence potential of biota. For example, the recent European Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 defines clear targets for identifying, establishing and integrating ecological corridors, as part of a Trans-European Nature Network. Here, we examined whether rivers could serve as such corridors, facilitating landscape connectivity (i.e. extent to which landscape facilitates or impedes species movement, exchange of genes, natal dispersal and metapopulation dynamics) among protected areas hosted within different countries in the Balkan Peninsula, southeastern Europe. To quantitatively address this question, we calculated the proportion of the river network enclosed within a protected area per country to detect patterns of protection coverage and explored the degree to which spatial connections between 1878 protected areas are supported by the river network. Acknowledging that dams hinder instream continuity, we further quantified potential loss of connections between protected areas caused by the existence of already implemented or planned dam projects upon critical river habitats of endangered fish species. Our results highlight that Balkan rivers have great potential in providing the spatial connections needed to establish landscape connectivity between most of protected areas in the region. Still, heedless hydropower growth and dissimilarities in river protection between neighboring countries remain key challenges for the evolution of a relative framework. Transnational cooperation and systematic planning of infrastructure development could be the only efficient steps towards supporting the establishment of a river-based network to reconstruct connectivity between protected areas and meet biodiversity goals.Show less"
23,"Rolls, RJ",Aug 2014 ,Multiple factors determine the effect of anthropogenic barriers to connectivity on riverine fish,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Habitat fragmentation is a key anthropogenic factor in biodiversity decline, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. We predicted that differences in fish assemblage composition due to the impact of fragmentation would most strongly affect migratory species, and these effects would be dependent on the interaction between the characteristics of each barrier and the antecedent flow conditions that determine temporal variation in connectivity. These hypotheses were applied to a coastal river network in eastern Australia that is fragmented by multiple weirs and dams, including some with passage facilities. How these facilities interact with flow to mediate hydrological connectivity and hence patterns of community structure is unknown. Five distinct assemblages were identified that were associated with different combinations of environmental factors and barrier characteristics (spatial arrangement, passability), and key differences were due to variation in migration traits. Two spatially distinct assemblages were associated with fragmentation by two impassable barriers. However, the migration traits that accompanied these community changes were inconsistent between these groups, and likely reflected effects of barriers near the estuary and in the middle of the stream network on diadromous and freshwater-migratory species, respectively. Two assemblage groups in the vicinity of passable weirs varied temporally as a function of hydrology and the seasonal upstream movement of juvenile diadromous species. The effect of habitat loss in conjunction with fragmentation was evident, with a further assemblage group occurring in reaches where riparian vegetation and instream habitat have been altered by poor management of agriculture. This study indicates that the impact of habitat fragmentation in rivers depends on the interaction of the migration characteristics of biota, temporal variation in hydrology which mediates connectivity, and the location of anthropogenic barriers. Conservation policies aimed at minimizing human impacts on aquatic biodiversity need to jointly account for the separate impacts of habitat fragmentation and habitat loss.Show less"

This study selects the urban river network of Rencheng District, Jining City, China as a case to map and construct a river-based recreational network (RRN) in an urban river restoration context. Morphological spatial pattern analysis, connectivity evaluation methods, and an overlay method of ArcGIS are applied to identify river network connectivity and ecological sources, which are used to map RRN. The research findings show that except rivers in the Liangshan-Jining Canal, other rivers have medium, poor, or extremely poor ecological connectivity. The ecological sources are mainly distributed in the vicinity of Nanyang lake and Taibai lake. The distribution of river connectivity is largely correlated with the regional physical geography pattern (e. g., geological structure and topological position of water patches), as well as historical human activities (e.g., canalization). Furthermore, the continuous subsidence of coal mining subsidence areas, urban expansion and rural construction, environmental damage and pollution, natural changes (e.g., climate change) are the risk sources of river network connectivity. To restore the ecological and social connectivity of urban river network, an adaptive RRN is proposed according to the current environmental status and the factors affecting the river connectivity. Specifically, form-based and process-based restoration measures can be adopted in urban built-up areas and rural areas, respectively. The findings provide a holistic solution for the restoration and recreational use of urban river network at a regional scale, thereby promoting the coordination of urban ecosystems and sociocultural systems.Show less"
25,"Zeinali, M",Jan 2020 ,Simulating Unsaturated Zone of Soil for Estimating the Recharge Rate and Flow Exchange Between a River and an Aquifer,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"Coupling surface water and groundwater models dynamically based on a simultaneous simulation of saturated and unsaturated zones of soil is a useful method for determining the recharge rate and flow exchange between a river and an aquifer as well as simultaneous operation of water resources systems. Thus, the main objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of surface water and groundwater interactions through their systematic simulation and to create a dynamic coupling between surface water and groundwater resources of the area by relevant mathematical models. Accordingly, hydrologic soil moisture method and MODFLOW model were employed to simulate the unsaturated and saturated zones, respectively. The results revealed that simultaneous simulation of the saturated and unsaturated zones of the soil can illustrate the interaction between surface water and groundwater at any spatial and temporal intervals well through using complete hydroclimatological balance components in the form of a coupled model. The application of this method in the Loor-Andimeshk Plain, located in the southwest of Iran, showed that aquifer recharge through the plain area from November to March is due to precipitation. On the other hand, in the warm months (June to September), the plain is merely fed through irrigation water penetration. As the level of river water in both Dez and Balarood rivers is higher than the Loor-Andimeshk aquifer level, hence the exchange occurs as a leakage from the river to the aquifer. The highest and lowest values of average exchangeable water in Balarood River occur in March and April and in Dez River are from June to September.Show less"
26,"Segurado, P",Jul 2015 ,Historical changes in the functional connectivity of rivers based on spatial network analysis and the past occurrences of diadromous species in Portugal,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"The disruption of longitudinal connectivity caused by artificial barriers in rivers is considered to be a major threat to freshwater fish communities at the global scale. In Portugal, the construction of several big dams all through the 20th century was a major cause of disappearance or decline of long distance migratory fish species from various rivers. In this study we analysed the historical changes of functional connectivity for diadromous fish at the Tagus basin river network (Portugal), using a spatial graph approach that integrates both structural connectivity and habitat suitability. Due to the presence of many artificial barriers, the current distribution of species does not reflect natural environmental conditions. Therefore, historical data on the occurrence of species is paramount to assess the potential habitat suitability. The compilation of historical data on the distribution of diadromous species [Sea Lamprey-Petromyzon marinus (Linnaeus 1758) and Allis shad-Alosa alosa (Linnaeus 1758)] was based on geographical dictionaries and geo-referenced information for Portugal dated between 1700 and 1900. Habitat suitability was expressed as the probabilities of occurrence of empirical predictive models based on the historical records and a set of regionalized environmental data. The loss of connectivity caused by big dam construction between 1928 and 2004 was then analysed using a spatial graph approach. The output of this analysis will aid decision-makers to optimize targets of connectivity restoration actions aiming at enhancing the functional connectivity of the river network for diadromous species, using the historical situation as a benchmark.Show less"
27,"Vinagre, C",Jul 2011 ,Food Web Structure and Habitat Connectivity in Fish Estuarine Nurseries-Impact of River Flow,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,"River flow variability is known to influence estuarine production, yet knowledge on its effect upon estuarine food webs dynamics is still scarce. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were used to assess the effect of river flow in the connectivity and food web interactions between the two main fish nursery areas of the Tagus estuary. The aims of the present work were to investigate the seasonal variation in food web structure and the exchange rate of individuals of marine juvenile fish among estuarine nurseries, to compare the spring of a rainy year (2001) with that of an average year (2000), and to investigate the impact of the winter floods of 2001. A low level of connectivity was observed for the fish species that use these areas as nurseries. In low river flow conditions, two isotopically distinct food webs were established in each nursery area. These food webs were very sensitive to small variations in the freshwater input. Winter floods seem to disrupt the localized food webs that are established in low river flow periods, leading to the re-establishment of a wider food web. While in rainy years this wide food web is maintained until spring, in average years the food web undergoes fragmentation into two localized and isotopically distinctive food webs. The increase in frequency of droughts due to climate change should lower the connectivity of the estuarine fish nurseries food webs, causing habitat fragmentation and consequent loss in complexity and resilience.Show less"
28,"Wohl, E",Jan 15 2017 ,Introduction to the special issue: Connectivity in Geomorphology,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"With the increased recent attention on understanding the complex pathways and fluxes of material, energy, and organisms and the multidimensional coupling between various geomorphic process domains, the 47th Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium was organized around the theme of Connectivity in Geomorphology. Six key sub themes emerged: sediment connectivity, hydrologic connectivity, geochemical connectivity, riverine connectivity, landscape connectivity, and modeling of connectivity. Papers presented at the symposium and collected in this special issue elucidate the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of connectivity but also provide field-based and analytical approaches to document the fundamental role of connectivity in geomorphic and ecological functioning. Among the consistent themes that emerged from the papers and from discussion during the symposium were (1) the interconnectedness of diverse forms of connectivity, (2) the appropriateness (or not) of conceptualizing connectivity as a gradient or continuum, and (3) the importance of an explicitrecognition of disconnectivity as a mechanism to retain ecologically important materials and organisms within landscapes. Knowledge gaps identified in discussions during the symposium include: identifying questions that can be usefully addressed within a framework emphasizing connectivity; identifying feedbacks that enhance and limit connectivity; and quantification of diverse aspects of connectivity, of thresholds of connectivity, and of interactions among different types of connectivity.

29,"Perkin, JS",Dec 2012 ,Fragmentation alters stream fish community structure in dendritic ecological networks,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Effects of fragmentation on the ecology of organisms occupying dendritic ecological networks (DENs) have recently been described through both conceptual and mathematical models, but few hypotheses have been tested in complex, real-world ecosystems. Stream fishes provide a model system for assessing effects of fragmentation on the structure of communities occurring within DENs, including how fragmentation alters metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity. A recently developed habitat-availability measure, the ""dendritic connectivity index'' (DCI), allows for assigning quantitative measures of connectivity in DENs regardless of network extent or complexity, and might be used to predict fish community response to fragmentation. We characterized stream fish community structure in 12 DENs in the Great Plains, USA, during periods of dynamic (summer) and muted (fall) discharge regimes to test the DCI as a predictive model of fish community response to fragmentation imposed by road crossings. Results indicated that fish communities in stream segments isolated by road crossings had reduced species richness (alpha diversity) relative to communities that maintained connectivity with the surrounding DEN during summer and fall. Furthermore, isolated communities had greater dissimilarity (beta diversity) to downstream sites not isolated by road crossings during summer and fall. Finally, dissimilarity among communities within DENs decreased as a function of increased habitat connectivity (measured using the DCI) for summer and fall, suggesting that communities within highly connected DENs tend to be more homogeneous. Our results indicate that the DCI is sensitive to community effects of fragmentation in riverscapes and might be used by managers to predict ecological responses to changes in habitat connectivity. Moreover, our findings illustrate that relating structural connectivity of riverscapes to functional connectivity among communities might aid in maintaining metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity in complex dendritic ecosystems.Show less"

Hydrological connectivity (the percent of river channel water interacting with floodplain wetlands), water age (the time elapsed since water entered the system via the main river channel) and water temperature have strong impacts on the biogeochemical processes controlling the fate of sediment and nutrients at continental margins. A Delft3D hydrodynamic model was used to explore the role of river and tide forcings, hydrogeomorphology, and vegetation roughness on hydrological connectivity, water age, and water temperature of a young, prograding river delta in coastal Louisiana, Wax Lake Delta. Across a simulation period of January to June 2015, an average of 39.9% of river flow entered the delta floodplains and water within the floodplains had an average water age of 0.8 days. In winter and spring, floodplain zones with higher sediment surface elevations (supratidal hydrogeomorphic zones) were characterized by increased water age and warmer water temperatures compared to subtidal floodplains and channels. Our experimental models indicate that the presence of wetland vegetation decreases hydrological connectivity by preventing flow of water into deltaic floodplain, but increases water age by retaining water within the floodplains. Despite small amplitudes (-30 cm), tides create hourly exchange between channels and floodplains, which decreases water age in floodplains, but has little impact on average connectivity. Our results emphasize the role of both hydrological forcings (river and tides) and ecosystem features (vegetation and sediment surface elevation) in regulating channel-floodplain interactions in deltaic systems. Evaluated against field data, which is often difficult to collect at high spatial and temporal frequency in floodplains, this model performs well, highlighting the utility of numerical models in capturing landscape-scale hydrodynamics.Show less"
32,"Besacier-Monbertrand, AL",Jun 2014 ,SHORT-TERM IMPACTS OF LATERAL HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY RESTORATION ON AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"In floodplain ecosystems, the lateral hydrological connectivity between the main river channel and the secondary channels plays a major role in shaping both the habitat conditions and the macroinvertebrate diversity. Among other threats, human activities tend to reduce the lateral connectivity, which increases floodplain terrestrialization and induces a loss of aquatic biodiversity. Consequently, the restoration of lateral connectivity is of growing concern. We studied four secondary channels of the Rhone floodplain that were subjected either to no restoration or to three different restoration measures (river flow increase only, flow increase plus dredging and flow increase plus reconnection to the river). Macroinvertebrate and environmental data were analysed one year before and during a period of five years after restoration. We expected a progressive increase of lateral connectivity according to the type of restoration. Changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages were predicted to be towards more rheophilic communities and proportionally related to the changes in lateral connectivity.In the reconnected channel, lateral connectivity increased and remained high fiveyears after restoration. In the dredged channel, the immediate increase of the lateral connectivity metric induced by sediment removal was followed by a rapid decrease. In the unrestored channel and the channel only influenced by flow increase, the metric remained constant in time. The macroinvertebrate composition and the rarefied EPT richness changes were proportionally related to the changes in lateral connectivity. Alien species richness and densities increased progressively in all channels after restoration. Our results showed that modifications of the lateral connectivity lead to predictable changes in macroinvertebrate diversity. Synergistic interactions between restoration and longer-term changes (e.g. climatic change, invasion of alien species) encourage long-term monitoring to assess the durability and trends of restoration measures.

33,"Perkin, JS",Oct 2015 ,Fragmentation and drying ratchet down Great Plains stream fish diversity,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,"1. Stream fragmentation alters the structure of aquatic communities on a global scale, generally through loss of native species. Among riverscapes in the Great Plains of North America, stream fragmentation and hydrologic alteration (flow regulation and dewatering) are implicated in the decline of native fish diversity.2. This study documents the spatio-temporal distribution of fish reproductive guilds in the fragmented Arkansas and Ninnescah rivers of south-central Kansas using retrospective analyses involving 63 years of fish community data.3. Pelagic-spawning fishes declined throughout the study area during 1950-2013, including Arkansas River shiner (Notropis girardi) last reported in 1983, plains minnow (Hybognathus placitus) in 2006, and peppered chub (Macrhybopsis tetranema) in 2012. Longitudinal patterns in fish community structure in both rivers consisted of strong breaks associated with dams, and pelagic-spawning fishes were missing from shorter fragments upstream of those barriers. Among downstream and longer fragments, probability of occurrence for pelagic-spawning fishes declined or fell to zero during periods of drought.4. Based on these data, interactions between fragmentation and drying are hypothesized as operating as an ecological ratchet mechanism in which forward movement toward pelagic-spawning fish extirpation occurs during desiccation, and reciprocated reverse movement toward recolonization following return of flows is blocked by fragmentation. 5. The ratchet mechanism is capable of explaining the long-term 'ratcheting down' of fish diversity in Great Plains rivers and has implications for managing biodiversity in fragmented riverscapes where water is scarce or might become so in the future.

34,"Norton, SA",Sep 2000 ,Response of a first-order stream in Maine to short-term in-stream acidification,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"An experimental short-term acidification with HCl at a first-order stream in central Maine, USA was used to study processes controlling the changes in stream chemistry and to assess the ability of stream substrate to buffer pH. The streambed exerted a strong buffering capacity against pH change by ion exchange during the 6-hour acidification. Streambed substrates had substantial cation and anion exchange capacity in the pH range of 4.1 to 6.5. The ion exchange for cations and SO42- were rapid and reversible. The speed of release of cations from stream substrates was Na1+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Aln+ > Be2+, perhaps relating to charge density of these cations. Ca2+ desorption dominated neutralisation of excess H+ for the first 2 hr. As the reservoir of exchangeable Ca diminished, desorption land possibly dissolution) of Al3+ became the dominant neutralising mechanism. The exchangeable land possibly soluble) reservoir of Al was not depleted during the 6-hour acidification. Sulphate adsorption during the acidification reduced the concentration of SO42- in stream water by as much as 20 mu eq L-1 (from 70 mu eq L-1). Desorption of SO42- and adsorption of base cat ions after the artificial acidification resulted in a prolongation of the pH depression. The streambed had the capacity to buffer stream water chemistry significantly during an acidifying event affecting the entire upstream catchment.Show less"
35,"Teitelbaum, Y",Apr 2021 ,Dynamics of Hyporheic Exchange Flux and Fine Particle Deposition Under Moving Bedforms,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Deposition of fine suspended particles can reduce hyporheic exchange flux (HEF), which may result in impairment of various ecological processes. However, the dynamics of fine particle deposition and streambed clogging are still not well understood, especially when the bed is in motion. We conducted flume experiments to study the effects of coupled sand-clay dynamics on HEF with episodic (pulse) inputs of suspended kaolinite. Three experiments with a mobile sand bed and constant discharge were conducted with repeated injection of suspended kaolinite pulses at fixed concentration increments of 0.16, 0.41, and 0.66 g/L, respectively. HEF and participating porewater volume were assessed using tracer tests. Kaolinite deposition rates were inferred from turbidity measurements while deposition patterns were measured using core samples. We found that fine sediment primarily accumulated within a layer below the bedform scour zone, and that this layer was thicker when kaolinite was added in larger pulses. HEF declined linearly over time as kaolinite accumulated in the bed sediment; an increase of 0.1% kaolinite in the bed led to a decrease in HEF of 26.6 cm/day, regardless of the pulse concentration. However, the same kaolinite increase led to a reduction of 50% in participating pore volume for larger kaolinite pulses, versus only 30% for the smallest pulse. These results indicate that clogging occurs not just during and after high-flow events, but also under constant flow conditions in which episodic deposition of suspended clay by HEF leads to the formation of a low-conductivity layer in the bed.Show less"
36,"Rooney, RC",Dec 2013 ,River Connectivity Affects Submerged and Floating Aquatic Vegetation in Floodplain Wetlands,WETLANDS,"The submerged and floating plant communities in floodplain wetlands of the Upper Columbia River have never been described. To explore mechanisms behind the influence of the annual flood pulse on vegetation, we investigated how species group into flood response guilds whose distributions vary along a connectivity gradient between 44 floodplain wetlands and the river, how connectivity influences water and sediment, and to what degree the effect of connectivity on vegetation is mediated by its effects on these environmental variables. We characterised assemblages with cluster and indicator species analysis, as well as non-metric scaling ordination and tested a structural equation model, which defined the relationship between assemblage composition, sediment and water quality, and connectivity to the river. We found four assemblages, each associated with different water and sediment conditions, and positioned at differing degrees of connectivity. The model provided a good fit to the data. We conclude that in highly connected floodplain wetlands the direct effect of flooding supersedes the influence of water and sediment quality in structuring vegetation assemblages. Yet where flooding is less intense, these environmental variables resume their structuring role.Show less"
37,"Andersen, DC",Jun 2018 ,"Flood effects on soil thermal regimes in contrasting cold-desert river floodplains (Yampa and Green rivers, Colorado)",ECOHYDROLOGY,"Heat transfer theory suggests that floodplain soils in dryland riverine ecosystems can be cooled by hyporheic flows generated during spring floods. I compared soil temperature cycles and associated hydrologic factors on a free-flowing river to those on a river where flows and surface water temperatures are now regulated. Spring surface water temperatures were comparable on the 2 rivers, as was apparent diffusivity of the soil under mature Populus fremontii in a year when severe drought produced similar soil moisture regimes. Over 9years of monitoring, mean annual maximum soil temperature was higher on the regulated river than on the free-flowing river (10cm depth: 33 vs. 23 degrees C; 40cm depth: 30 vs. 20 degrees C, respectively), and sinusoidal models of the annual temperature cycle at each depth indicated higher means and greater amplitudes on the regulated river. The annual maximum soil temperature was inversely related to peak flood discharge on the free-flowing river but not on the regulated river. Temporal shifts in the lag between diel cycles at 40 and 10cm depthsan index of soil thermal diffusivitysuggested that the capillary fringe is strongly involved in heat exchange. An increase in the lag during some water table declines suggested that shallow soils may undergo flood-induced evaporative cooling. Hyporheic recharge can be an ecologically important determinant of growing-season soil temperatures at plant rooting depth in dryland river floodplains. Reductions in spring flood magnitude due to river regulation, water abstraction, or climate change can increase these temperatures and thereby alter ecosystem structure and functioning.Show less"
38,"O'Mara, K",Sep 20 2021 ,Connectivity of fish communities in a tropical floodplain river system and predicted impacts of potential new dams,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Longitudinal and lateral connectivity is important for mobile aquatic species in rivers for reproductive migrations, recruitment, gene flow and access to food resources across habitat types. Water resource developments such as dams and levees may disrupt these connections, causing river fragmentation and loss of access to highly productive habitats such as floodplain wetlands. We used sulfur stable isotopes as a tracer to estimate patterns of fish movement in an unregulated river in tropical northern Australia, taking advantage of observed spatial variation in sulfur isotope values of their food resources across the catchment. We also modelled the flow and barrier related impacts of potential dam development scenarios on fish movement. Fish with isotope values significantly different from local prey values were determined to be migrants. In the 'no dams' scenario, movement varied among fish species (0-44% migrant fish within species where n > 5) and sites (0-40% migrant fish within sites where n > 5), and immigration was higher in more connected sites. Impacts of water resource development on fish movement varied between dam scenarios, with predictions that a dam on the main channel of the Mitchell River would have the highest impact of the three individual dam scenarios. This study provides critical information on how flow-mediated connectivity supports patterns of fish community movement in an unregulated river system. The generic quantitative approach of combining tracers of fish movement with connectivity modelling provides a powerful predictive tool. While we used sulfur stable isotopes to estimate fish movement, our approach can be used with other tracers of movement such as otoliths and acoustic telemetry, making it widely applicable to guide sustainable development in other river systems.Crown Copyright (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

39,"Briggs, MA",Jun 16 2015 ,A physical explanation for the development of redox microzones in hyporheic flow,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Recent observations reveal a paradox of anaerobic respiration occurring in seemingly oxic-saturated sediments. Here we demonstrate a residence time-based explanation for this paradox. Specifically, we show how microzones favorable to anaerobic respiration processes (e.g., denitrification, metal reduction, and methanogenesis) can develop in the embedded less mobile porosity of bulk-oxic hyporheic zones. Anoxic microzones develop when transport time from the streambed to the pore center exceeds a characteristic uptake time of oxygen. A two-dimensional pore-network model was used to quantify how anoxic microzones develop across a range of hyporheic flow and oxygen uptake conditions. Two types of microzones develop: flow invariant and flow dependent. The former is stable across variable hydrologic conditions, whereas the formation and extent of the latter are sensitive to flow rate and orientation. Therefore, pore-scale residence time heterogeneity, which can now be evaluated in situ, offers a simple explanation for anaerobic signals occurring in oxic pore waters.Show less"
40,"Mock, M",,Relational coupling of multiple streams: The case of COVID-19 infections in German abattoirs(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,"After a series of COVID-19 outbreaks among employees in the German meat-processing industry, the Work Safety Control Act protecting these workers made it on the government's agenda in July 2020. From a Multiple Streams perspective, local corona hotspots may be understood as policy windows for introducing respective measures. However, this alone is not sufficient to explain agenda setting. This study investigates the coupling of streams within policy windows. Introducing the notion of relational coupling to the MSF research agenda, discourse network analysis provides a new methodology to reveal entrepreneurial activities. Studying the German mass media discourse on the issue identifies two stages: (1) An initial problem brokerage without coupling of core policies, followed by (2) a coupling across all streams based on a focusing event. We argue that relational coupling allows for an enhanced understanding of agenda setting.Show less"
41,"Richardson, WB",Jun 2019 ,Nitrogen cycling in large temperate floodplain rivers of contrasting nutrient regimes and management,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Hydraulic connection between channels and floodplains (""connectivity"") is a fundamental determinant of ecosystem function in large floodplain rivers. Factors controlling material processing in these rivers depend not only on the degree of connectivity but also on the sediment conditions, nutrient loads, and source. Nutrient cycling in the nutrient-rich upper Mississippi River (MISS) is relatively well studied, whereas that of less eutrophic tributaries is not (e.g., St Croix River; SACN). We examined components of nitrogen cycling in 2 floodplain rivers of contrasting nutrient enrichment and catchment land use to test the hypothesis that N-cycling rates will be greater in the MISS with elevated nutrient loads and productivity in contrast to the relatively nutrient-poor SACN. Nitrate (NO3--N) concentrations were greatest in flowing habitats in the MISS and often undetectable in isolated backwaters except where groundwater inputs occurred. In the SACN, NO3--N concentrations were greatest in the flowing backwater where groundwater inputs were high. Ambient nitrification in the MISS was twice that in the SACN and tended to be lowest in the main channel. Denitrification was 3x greater in the MISS than that in the SACN, N-limited in both rivers. Community production/respiration was >1 in the MISS and likely provisioned labile C to fuel microbial metabolism and dissimilatory NO3--N reduction, whereas the heterotrophic (production/respiration < 1) nature of the SACN likely limited microbial metabolism and NO3--N dissimilation. It appears that N-cycling in the SACN was driven by groundwater, whereas that in the MISS was supported mainly by water column N-sources.Show less"
42,"Malvadkar, U",Feb 2015 ,A COMPARISON OF CONNECTIVITY METRICS ON WATERSHEDS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR WATER MANAGEMENT,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Barriers within streams can affect riverine species' ability to access habitats and may reduce their population viability. Connectivity metrics attempt to quantify the impacts of barriers; however, little is known about their functioning when applied to dendritic habitats such as watersheds. Several graph-theoretic connectivity metrics were calculated on rivers originating in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. These metrics were classified into two primary groups: metrics that count weighted paths through the stream network and metrics that predict the flow of organisms through a stream reach. Representative metrics from each of these categories were suggested to model the effects of dams and water intakes, respectively. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
43,"Li, YP",Nov 2002 ,Air-sea interactions during the passage of a winter storm over the Gulf Stream: A three-dimensional coupled atmosphere-ocean model study,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,"[1] A three-dimensional, regional coupled atmosphere-ocean model with full physics is developed to study air-sea interactions during winter storms off the U. S. east coast. Because of the scarcity of open ocean observations, models such as this offer valuable opportunities to investigate how oceanic forcing drives atmospheric circulation and vice versa. The study presented here considers conditions of strong atmospheric forcing (high wind speeds) and strong oceanic forcing (significant sea surface temperature (SST) gradients). A simulated atmospheric cyclone evolves in a manner consistent with Eta reanalysis, and the simulated air-sea heat and momentum exchanges strongly affect the circulations in both the atmosphere and the ocean. For the simulated cyclone of 19-20 January 1998, maximum ocean-to-atmosphere heat fluxes first appear over the Gulf Stream in the South Atlantic Bight, and this results in rapid deepening of the cyclone off the Carolina coast. As the cyclone moves eastward, the heat flux maximum shifts into the region near Cape Hatteras and later northeast of Hatteras, where it enhances the wind locally. The oceanic response to the atmospheric forcing is closely related to the wind direction. Southerly and southwesterly winds tend to strengthen surface currents in the Gulf Stream, whereas northeasterly winds weaken the surface currents in the Gulf Stream and generate southwestward flows on the shelf. The oceanic feedback to the atmosphere moderates the cyclone strength. Compared with a simulation in which the oceanic model always passes the initial SST to the atmospheric model, the coupled simulation in which the oceanic model passes the evolving SST to the atmospheric model produces higher ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux near Gulf Stream meander troughs. This is due to wind-driven lateral shifts of the stream, which in turn enhance the local northeasterly winds. Away from the Gulf Stream the coupled simulation produces surface winds that are 5 similar to 10% weaker. Differences in the surface ocean currents between these two experiments are significant on the shelf and in the open ocean.Show less"

Despite implications for top-down and bottom-up control and the stability of food webs, understanding the links between consumers and their diets remains difficult, particularly in remote tropical locations where food resources are usually abundant and variable and seasonal hydrology produces alternating patterns of connectivity and isolation.2. We used a large scale survey of freshwater biota from 67 sites in three catchments (Daly River, Northern Territory; Fitzroy River, Western Australia; and the Mitchell River, Queensland) in Australia's wet-dry tropics and analysed stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) to search for broad patterns in resource use by consumers in conjunction with known and measured indices of connectivity, the duration of floodplain inundation, and dietary choices (i.e. stomach contents of fish).3. Regression analysis of biofilm delta C-13 against consumer delta C-13, as an indicator of reliance on local food sources (periphyton and detritus), varied depending on taxa and catchment.4. The carbon isotope ratios of benthic invertebrates were tightly coupled to those of biofilm in all three catchments, suggesting assimilation of local resources by these largely nonmobile taxa.5. Stable C isotope ratios of fish, however, were less well-linked to those of biofilm and varied by catchment according to hydrological connectivity; the perennially flowing Daly River with a long duration of floodplain inundation showed the least degree of coupling, the seasonally flowing Fitzroy River with an extremely short flood period showed the strongest coupling, and the Mitchell River was intermediate in connectivity, flood duration and consumer-resource coupling.6. These findings highlight the high mobility of the fish community in these rivers, and how hydrological connectivity between habitats drives patterns of consumer-resource coupling.Show less"

Although timing of drying and flooding is predictable, seasonal and annual intensity of these events is not. Sequential flooding and drying, coupled with anthropogenic influences make these med-rivers among the most stressed riverine habitat worldwide. Med-rivers are hotspots for biodiversity in all med-regions. Species in med-rivers require different, often opposing adaptive mechanisms to survive drought and flood conditions or recover from them. Thus, metacommunities undergo seasonal differences, reflecting cycles of river fragmentation and connectivity, which also affect ecosystem functioning. River conservation and management is challenging, and trade-offs between environmental and human uses are complex, especially under future climate change scenarios. This overview of a Special Issue on med-rivers synthesizes information presented in 21 articles covering the five med-regions worldwide: Mediterranean Basin, coastal California, central Chile, Cape region of South Africa, and southwest and southern Australia. Research programs to increase basic knowledge in less-developed med-regions should be prioritized to achieve increased abilities to better manage med-rivers.Show less"
48,"Ding, YF",Mar 2017 ,Applications of Coupled Explicit-Implicit Solution of SWEs for Unsteady Flow in Yangtze River,WATER,"In engineering practice, the unsteady flows generated from the operation of hydropower station in the upstream region could significantly change the navigation system of waterways located in the middle-lower reaches of the river. In order to study the complex propagation, convergence and superposition characteristics of unsteady flows in a long channel with flow confluence, a numerical model based on the coupling of implicit and explicit solution algorithms of Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) has been applied to two large rivers in the reach of Yangtze River, China, which covers the distance from Yibin to Chongqing located upstream side of the Three Gorges Dam. The accuracy of numerical model has been validated by both the steady and unsteady flows using the prototype hydrological data. It is found that the unsteady flows show much more complex water level and discharge behaviors than the steady ones. The studied unsteady flows arising from the water regulation of two upstream hydropower stations could influence the region as far as Zhutuo hydrologic station, which is close to the city of Chongqing. Meanwhile, the computed stage-discharge rating curves at all observation stations demonstrate multi-value loop patterns because of the presence of additional water surface gradient. The present numerical model proves to be robust for simulating complex flows in very long engineering rivers up to 400 km.Show less"
49,"Maheu, A",Nov 15 2014 ,River evaporation and corresponding heat fluxes in forested catchments,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"River water temperature is a very important variable in ecological studies, especially for the management of fisheries and aquatic resources. Temperature can impact on fish distribution, growth, mortality and community dynamics. River evaporation has been identified as an important heat loss and a key process in the thermal regime of rivers. However, its quantification remains a challenge, mainly because of the difficulty of making direct measurements. The objectives of this study were to characterize the evaporative heat flux at different scales (brook vs river) and to improve the estimation of the evaporative heat flux in a stream temperature model at the hourly timescale. Using a mass balance approach with floating minipans, we measured river evaporation at an hourly timescale in a medium-sized river (Little Southwest Miramichi) and a small brook (Catamaran Brook) in New Brunswick, Canada. With these direct measurements of evaporation, we developed mass transfer equations to estimate hourly evaporation rates from microclimate conditions measured 2m above the stream. During the summer 2012, river evaporation was more important for the medium-sized river with a mean daily evaporation rate of 3.0mmday(-1) in the Little Southwest Miramichi River compared with that of 1.0mmday(-1) in Catamaran Brook. Evaporation was the main heat loss mechanism in the two studied streams and was responsible for 42% of heat losses in the Little Southwest Miramichi River and 34% of heat losses in Catamaran Brook during the summer.
