0,"Allen, GH",Feb 9 2018 ,Similarity of stream width distributions across headwater systems,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"The morphology and abundance of streams control the rates of hydraulic and biogeochemical exchange between streams, groundwater, and the atmosphere. In large river systems, the relationship between river width and abundance is fractal, such that narrow rivers are proportionally more common than wider rivers. However, in headwater systems, where many biogeochemical reactions are most rapid, the relationship between stream width and abundance is unknown. To constrain this uncertainty, we surveyed stream hydromorphology (wetted width and length) in several headwater stream networks across North America and New Zealand. Here, we find a strikingly consistent lognormal statistical distribution of stream width, including a characteristic most abundant stream width of 32 +/- 7 cm independent of discharge or physiographic conditions. We propose a hydromorphic model that can be used to more accurately estimate the hydromorphology of streams, with significant impact on the understanding of the hydraulic, ecological, and biogeochemical functions of stream networks.Show less"
1,"Turner, AM",Dec 1 2022 ,Chemical fragmentation of stream systems and fish species richness: The upstream effects of water pollution,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The loading of chemical pollutants into stream systems can result in isolation of aquatic communities upstream of the discharge. Ecological theory suggests that isolation will result in species richness losses, but this potential indirect effect of stream pollution is not widely studied. Here, I present a study of fish assemblage structure in watersheds that have been longitudinally fragmented by abandoned mine drainage. A number of headwater streams in the Clarion River watershed of the upper Ohio River Basin, Pennsylvania, USA, have escaped any direct effects of abandoned mine drainage but have been isolated by severe pollution lower in the watershed. I evaluated the effects of watershed fragmentation on fish species richness, composition, and abundance by comparing the fish assemblages of 22 headwater streams embedded in watersheds receiving mine effluent with the assemblages of 34 reference streams with no apparent blockages to dispersal. I used a general linear model to evaluate the effect of isolation on species richness while accounting for stream size and water quality. I also used non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational analysis of variance to evaluate differences in fish species composition between isolated and reference streams. Controlling for the effect of stream size, reference streams had a mean richness of 3.63 species (+/- 0.27 SE), but isolated streams had a mean species richness of just 1.02 (+/- 0.33), a 3.5x difference. Species occupying isolated stream systems were a nested subset of fish species in reference streams. Species composition also differed between isolated and reference streams, with higher relative abundance of Creek Chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus [Mitchill, 1818]) and lower relative abundances of Mottled Sculpin (Cottus bairdii Girard, 1850) and Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis [Mitchill, 1814]) in isolated streams. These results illustrate an important indirect effect of water pollution in dendritic watersheds and provide evidence for the importance of connectivity in maintaining aquatic biodiversity.Show less"
2,"Oware, EK",Sep 2020 ,Storm Driven Seasonal Variation in the Thermal Response of the Streambed Water of a Low-Gradient Stream,WATER,"Storm events strongly influence water temperatures in the saturated substrate underlying stream channels, or the hyporheic zone (HZ). The goal of this study was to evaluate the impacts of storm events on thermal transport in the HZ. A year of temperature data were collected from six (6) multi-level samplers at multiple depths (30 cm, 60 cm, 90 cm and 150 cm) and were categorized into seasonal storm events. Analysis of the HZ temperature profiles revealed a seasonal reversal in the post-storm temperature change (Delta T) in the substrate. Increases in the Delta T were observed in the warm period (summer), whereas decreases occurred during the cold period (winter); both were associated with the direction of the pre-storm thermal gradient between the stream and substrate temperatures. The amplitude of Delta T became muted with increasing depth. Two-sample t-test analyses showed statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-storm temperatures at all depths during the warm period and at all depths except 150 cm in the cold period. Upwelling groundwater moderates the thermal response. There were no statistically significant differences in the pre- and post-storm stream temperatures during both the cold and warm periods.Show less"

Analysis of 40 years of water levels in East Channel of the central delta, in combination with a floodplain geometry model to estimate river water volumes added to lake waters at the annual flood peak, permitted direct estimation of annual river-to-lake connection times, lake water renewal, and interannual variabilities in nine lakes spanning the full range of sill elevations in the delta. Results have revealed a broad range of river-to-lake connectivities and river water renewals that are temporally dynamic and vary considerably among the lakes of this river delta system. Lakes with short and variable connection times plus low and variable river water renewal yield groups of lakes with high degrees of individuality because they are strongly influenced by particular sequences of antecedent years (legacy effects) that may result in lakes simultaneously containing residual waters from multiple river inundation events separated by more than a decade. Lakes with long and less varying connection times plus high river water renewal with multiple possible river water resets per year yield lakes with high degrees of similarity. The full combination of lakes arranged in an intermittently connected continuum, creating variable connectivity for aquatic organisms and water intermixing, may be an important mechanism driving the collectively distinctive habitat productivity and biodiversity of aquatic communities in this system, relative to lakes on the surrounding landscape.Show less"
4,"Laube, G",Jan 2022 ,"A systematic model-based evaluation of the influence of hydraulic conductivity, heterogeneity and domain depth on hyporheic nutrient transformation",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The hyporheic zone provides opportunities for the turnover and removal of nutrients such as ammonium and nitrate from stream water. Hyporheic flow patterns and dynamics govern the transport of nutrients and other solutes through the hyporheic zone and in turn control their transformation and removal. To better understand the links between flow and turnover, we systematically studied nutrient turnover rates with simulated sets of idealized streambed domains which varied in domain depth, hydraulic conductivity, its heterogeneity and anisotropy. We show that both aerobic (e.g. nitrification) and anaerobic (e.g. denitrification) turnover rates generally decrease monotonically with decreasing sediment conductivity at sufficiently large hyporheic zone depth. However, a reduction of the domain depth leads to an optimum of anaerobic turnover rates at intermediate conductivity due to the rate or transit time limitations of the reaction at the far ends of the conductivity range. Furthermore, conductivity heterogeneity generally lowers the turnover rates of both aerobic and anaerobic reactions. It is demonstrated how to reproduce this reduced nutrient turnover in heterogeneous sediments via a simplified anisotropy, which facilitates the prediction of turnover rates in heterogeneous sediments in certain cases. Our results foster the understanding of the interplay between hyporheic exchange and nutrient transformations and they aim to facilitate the conceptualization of large scale numerical simulations by demonstrating the effect of study design decisions like domain extent, heterogeneity and anisotropy.Show less"

The model captures the warming and cooling impacts of urban development and restoration through a water and energy budget. The water budget includes river inflows from urban storm sewers and reservoirs, and the associated water temperatures. The energy budget adjusts radiation fluxes due to riparian shading and evapotranspiration, and propagates temperature downstream. Restorative cooling of the river can be simulated through algorithms for cool groundwater, either as direct inflows or by river water replacement called hyporheic exchange. Novel features in the model include diurnal variation in riparian shading, use of the Army Corps of Engineers HEC-RAS model predicted river depths and velocities, and periodic boundary conditions to rapidly extend restoration scenarios.Freely available code in C++ for Visual Studio, with a detailed manual and sample inputs and outputs at http: //www.itreetools.org/research_suite/coolriver.Useful for simulating river warming or cooling due to urban development or greening.Well documented source code compatible with requirements of other modeling groups.

6,"Young, MK",Jun 1996 ,"Summer movements and habitat use by Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus) in small, montane streams",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Radio telemetry was used to assess the mobility of, and habitat use by, 29 adult Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus) in the North Fork Little Snake River drainage in south-central Wyoming from 27 May to 27 August 1992. Median home range (233 m) and median total movement (332 m) were larger than expected for cutthroat trout in small streams, and all but two fish used more than one primary habitat type during the study. Median weekly movement and the number of primary habitat units used generally declined as summer progressed. Of the available habitats, those used by Colorado River cutthroat trout tended to consist of deeper water in pools, especially pools formed by large woody debris. Fish were significantly farther from stream banks and not significantly closer to cover than would be expected by chance. These patterns of mobility and habitat use may be influenced by the connectivity and productivity of the study streams.Show less"
7,"Spurgeon, JJ",Feb 2018 ,Mixed-origins of channel catfish in a large-river tributary,FISHERIES RESEARCH,"An understanding of factors responsible for population structure including the origins of individuals from among habitats is fundamental to conservation and management of large-river fishes. The prevalence of population mixing of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus was evaluated within a large-river tributary environment using information from recent environmental history and natal origin derived from otolith microchemistry. Trace elements in water and otoliths were assessed using univariate and multivariate statistical approaches. Water and otolith trace elements differed among river segments facilitating classification of channel catfish to the river segment of capture. Accuracy of the classification tree model for juvenile channel catfish ranged from 44% to 88%. Recent environmental and natal origin microchemistry signatures suggested the channel catfish population within a large-river tributary comprises individuals from multiple locations. Population demographics of channel catfish is likely influenced by mixing of individuals from across the riverine-network. Consideration of the importance of connectivity between main-stem and tributary systems may, therefore, benefit conservation and management of channel catfish and other large -river fishes displaying similar life-history strategies.Show less"
8,"Liu, J",Dec 2013 ,"Effects of connectivity, dispersal directionality and functional traits on the metacommunity structure of river benthic diatoms",JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"AimDendritic ecological networks (DENs), such as river systems, combine features that challenge the traditional conceptual views and empirical approaches applied to metacommunities. As a result of their dendritic branching geometry and stream flow directionality, they are strongly hierarchical and asymmetrical. We analysed the metacommunity structure of benthic diatoms in a large-scale river system with the aim of evaluating the importance of potential causal influences. Furthermore, we hypothesized that metacommunities of diatoms that are strongly attached to their substrata show a different spatial structure than metacommunities of other, more weakly attached diatoms.LocationThe study was carried out in the Dong River, a 32,275km(2) subtropical river network located in southern China.MethodsWe surveyed benthic diatom communities during three seasons (dry, intermediate and wet). Using partial redundancy analysis, we partitioned community variation among environmental models and different spatial eigenfunction models to evaluate the influence of alternative dispersal pathways (overland versus water course dispersal), stream directionality, man-made dams and diatom functional traits on diatom metacommunity structure.ResultsModels based on hydrological connections and water directionality represent spatial patterns better than overland distances, suggesting that the dynamics of benthic diatom metacommunities are mainly confined to the river network and influenced by the prevailing water flow. We found significant effects of man-made dams on the spatial structure of important limnological variables and diatom metacommunity structure. The metacommunity of strongly attached diatoms also showed a weaker signature of flow directionality than that of other growth forms, especially in seasons with high water levels.Main conclusionsWe conclude that the consideration of among-site connectivity, flow directionality and species traits is key to a better understanding of the spatial ecology of passively dispersing microbial organisms in river systems.Show less"
9,"Wang, JY",Apr 2022 ,Characteristics of segmentation and interseismic coupling along the Red River fault from GPS observations,CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION,"The Red River fault is one of the important block boundary fault in Chuandian region. Therefore, it is great significance for studying the activity characteristics of different sections of the Red River fault to understand the movement characteristics of Chuandian region and the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. We obtained the current GPS velocity field near the Red River fault by using the GPS stations encrypted from 2014 to 2018 and combining with the GPS velocity field data in Chinese mainland from 1999 to 2016. Firstly, the study area can be divided into five relatively independent blocks by F test method : Southern China block, Daliangshan block, Chuanxibei block, Central Dian block and Southwest Dian block. Then, through the profile projection analysis of GPS velocity field, the Red River fault can be divided into three segments : the northern segment is from Eryuan to Midu, the middle segment is from Midu to Yuanjiang, and the southern segment is from Yuanjiang to Yuanyang. On these basis, the nearfield effects of Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault, Xiaojiang fault, Wuliangshan fault and Chuxiong-Jianshui fault in the Red River fault are considered in this paper, the slip rate and interseismic coupling degree of Red River fault, Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault and Xiaojiang fault are inversed by using three-dimensional elastic block model and negative dislocation theory, and the model resolution is tested respectively. The results show that : (1) The northern segment of the Red River fault is completely locked 16 km below the surface, and the middle segment is completely locked 8 km below the surface; The locking degree of the southern segment is significantly weaker than that of the northern segment and the middle segment; the northern section of the Red River fault still has a high seismic risk. (2) The middle and southern section of the Red River fault may no longer act as the southwest boundary of the Central Dian block independently, but act as the block boundary together with the Wuliangshan fault and the Chuxiong-Jianshui fault, especially in the southern segment of the Red River fault. (3) The southern segment of the Red River fault is located in the transition zone from the Central Dian block to the Southern China block, and its motion characteristics have changed from the dextral srike-slip movement in the middle and northern segments to the sinistral strike-slip movement.Show less"

Water samples were collected hourly over 17 h in the river and in three depths in the HZ using minipoint samplers. The four relatively variable time series were subsequently used to calculate first order removal rates and retardation coefficients via a one-dimensional reactive transport model. Reversible sorption processes led to substantial retardation of many TrOCs along the investigated hyporheic flow path. Some TrOCs, such as dihydroxy-carbamazepine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and venlafaxine, were found to be stable in the HZ. Others were readily removed with half-lives in the first 10 cm of the HZ ranging from 0.1 +/- 0.01 h for iopromide to 3.3 +/- 0.3 h for tramadol. Removal rate constants of the majority of reactive TrOCs were highest in the first 10 cm of the HZ, where removal of biodegradable dissolved organic matter was also the highest. Because conditions were oxic along the top 30 cm of the investigated flow path, we attribute this finding to the high microbial activity typically associated with the shallow HZ. Frequent and short vertical hyporheic exchange flows could therefore be more important for reach-scale TrOC removal than long, lateral hyporheic flow paths.Show less"
11,"Gonzalez-Romero, J",Aug 15 2022 ,Post-fire management effects on hillslope-stream sediment connectivity in a Mediterranean forest ecosystem,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Forest fires intensify sediment transport and aggravate local and off-site consequences of soil erosion. This study evaluates the influence of post-fire measures on structural and functional sediment connectivity (SC) in five fire affected Mediterranean catchments, which include 929 sub-catchments, by using the ""aggregated index of connectivity "" (AIC) at two temporal scenarios: I) immediately after the fire and before implementing post-fire practices ('Pre-man'), and II) two years after the fire ('Post-man'). The latter includes all the emergency stabilization practices, that are hillslope barriers, check-dams and afforestation. The stream system was set as the target of the computation (STR), to be representative of intense rainfall-runoff events with effective sediment delivery outside the catchments. Output normalization (AIC(N)) allows comparing the results of the five basins between them. The sedimentological analysis is based on specific sediment yield (SSY) -measured at the check-dams installed after the fire -, and this data is used for output evaluation. Stream density and slope variables were the most influential factors on AIC(N-STR) results at the sub-catchment scale. Post-fire hillslope treatments (barriers when built in high densities and afforestation) significantly reduced AIC(N-STR) in comparison with untreated areas in both structural and functional approaches. Despite the presence of hillslope treatments, the higher erosive rainfall conditions resulted in higher AIC(N-STR) values in the Post-man scenario (functional approach). A positive and good correlation was found between the measured SSY and the AIC(N-STR) changes due to the post-fire practices and vegetation recovery, showing the good correspondence of the computation results and the real sediment dynamics of the studied catchments. Overall, AIC(N) demonstrated to be a useful and versatile tool for post-fire management, which needs further research to optimize its applicability.Show less"
12,"Semiromi, MT",Jul 2020 ,"How Do Gaining and Losing Streams React to the Combined Effects of Climate Change and Pumping in the Gharehsoo River Basin, Iran?",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Projections of potential impacts of climate change and groundwater abstraction on gaining and losing streams, particularly in ephemeral river basins exhibiting sporadic and intricate flux exchanges, have remained largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a promising modeling scheme based on the new fully integrated hydrological model SWAT-MODFLOW-NWT, calibrated and validated for 1978-2012, to quantify the intertwined surface-groundwater interactions under a conjuncture of three climatic emission scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) and two groundwater pumping variants: ""pumping"" (extending current groundwater utilization into the future) and ""nonpumping"" (assuming a complete cease of pumping in the future). By forcing the integrated model with future downscaled climate predictors of CanESM2 under the aforementioned RCPs for three time slices up to year 2100, projections of various water resources components for the Gharehsoo River Basin (GRB), in northwestern Iran were made. Results demonstrate that because of a general decrease of future precipitation, though with ups and downs across the total projection period, most of the surface and -subsurface budget quantities and fluxes are substantially affected. In particular, future groundwater discharge (baseflow) to the gaining streams will be more influenced by the ""pumping"" variant (increasing and decreasing for ""nonpumping"" and ""pumping"", respectively) than the concentrated groundwater recharge from the losing streams (decreasing and increasing for ""nonpumping"" and ""pumping"", respectively). Future water yield and groundwater storage will also diminish and, surprisingly, this cannot be alleviated by future ""nonpumping"", indicating the groundwater overutilization is the compelling reason for the future water scarcity in the GRB, rather than climate change alone.Show less"
13,"Yang, YZ",Feb 2019 ,"Delineating the hydrological processes and hydraulic connectivities under permafrost degradation on Northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Climatic warming has resulted in permafrost degradation and it is expected to alter the hydrological processes and hydraulic connectivity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Some important and pending issues for understanding the hydrological processes in permafrost regions are how much melting water from thawing permafrost can feed the stream water and how the hydraulic connectivities will be altered under continual permafrost degradation. In this study, the Source Area of the Yellow River locating on the Northeast QTP was studied by using stable isotopic method and field hydrological observation. Results exhibited significant seasonal hydrological variations of stream water, thermokarst lakes, and ground ice. Hydrograph separation suggested that precipitation is the main contributor to stream water in ice-free months, accounting for 53.5% and 52.2% of the streams on average for the two branches, respectively. The second source is springs, which contributed about 29.8% and 17.9%. However, the recharge from melting ice is also important; it exported an average of 16.7% and 13.2% to the surface stream. Conceptual model and stable isotopes emphasized the remarkable hydraulic connectivities between the precipitation, stream water, thermokarst lakes, spring, and the near-surface ground ice. Current findings provide a basic understanding of the log-term hydrological processes under permafrost degradation, and can offer an efficient way to assess future hydrological changes and water resource protection.Show less"
14,"Pinardi, M",Nov 1 2022 ,Agricultural practices regulate the seasonality of groundwater-river nitrogen exchanges,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,"Soil System Budgets (SSB) of nutrients are generally performed annually over arable land to infer their use efficiency and water pollution risk in highly exploited agricultural watersheds. They are seldom partitioned into seasonal budgets and matched with seasonal nutrient transport in adjacent river reaches. We calculated seasonal soil nitrogen (N) budgets in a Mincio River sub-basin (Italy), and we analyzed the dissolved inorganic N net export in the river reach draining such sub-basin. Our results show seasonal differences of SSB with N excess in winter and even more in spring, equilibrium among sources and sinks during autumn and N deficit during summer. Seasonal inorganic N loads transported by the river were not correlated with SSB as they peaked in late summer and were at their minimum in early spring. Fertilization uncoupled to significant uptake supports N excess in winter and spring, whereas crop uptake uncoupled to N inputs supports summer N deficit. Nitrification cannot explain nitrate accumulation in the river reach, suggesting alternative dynamics driving the local hydrology. Flood irrigation results in large soil nitrate solubilization, transport and in upward migration of the groundwater piezometric head during spring and summer periods. River water is likely replaced by nitrate-rich groundwater when the groundwater recharge exceeds a certain threshold coinciding with late summer. Irrigation is then interrupted and the piezometric head, together with nitrate exchange, decreases. This work suggests that a deep understanding of N dynamics in agricultural watersheds with flooding irrigation on permeable soils needs the reconstruction of the vertical pathways of nitrate and of river-groundwater interactions. Moreover, the partitioning of annual into seasonal N budgets and their combination with irrigation practices allows the identification of hot moments in N cycling. Agricultural practices minimizing nitrate excess, its mobility and the risk of surface and groundwater pollution are suggested for this area.Show less"
15,"Hein, CL",May 2011 ,Effects of coupled natural and anthropogenic factors on the community structure of diadromous fish and shrimp species in tropical island streams,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"P>1. Overlapping river and road networks provide a framework for studying the complex interactions between natural and human systems, with river-road intersections as focal areas of study. Roads can alter the morphology of stream channels, pose barriers to freshwater fauna, provide easy access to streams for humans and non-native species and accelerate the expansion of urban development.2. We determined what variables control the structure of diadromous fish and shrimp communities and assessed whether particular road crossings altered community structure in north-eastern Puerto Rico. We identified 24 sites that represented a range of river and road sizes across two catchments that drain El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico.3. The location of natural barriers and the size of stream pools were the most important variables for predicting six of fifteen fish and shrimp distributions. Predatory fishes were predicted to be limited to areas in the river network below large, steep waterfalls, whereas adult shrimp Atya lanipes (Atyidae) were predicted to be present above these waterfalls. The fish Awaous banana was predicted to be present in pools > 11.6 m wide, whereas the shrimp Xiphocaris elongata was predicted to be present in pools < 10.4 m wide. The distributions of nine species were predicted poorly, but three of these species were common and three were rare.4. Although urban and agricultural land covers were among the top three predictors of five species distributions, they were probably good predictors because they were correlated with the natural gradient. Further study is necessary to disentangle natural and anthropogenic gradients.5. Road crossings, 10 of which were culverts, were not dispersal barriers for fishes or shrimps. On average, species were present both upstream and downstream from road crossings at 68% of sites where they occurred. Absences upstream or downstream from road crossings occurred at 16% of sites each and likely resulted from a failure to detect species.6. Several existing features of these catchments and taxa may aid in fish and shrimp conservation. The headwaters are protected by management practices of El Yunque National Forest, connectivity within the river network has been maintained, and the diadromous life history of these organisms makes them resilient to pulsed disturbances.Show less"
16,"Leach, JA",Aug 30 2017 ,Insights on stream temperature processes through development of a coupled hydrologic and stream temperature model for forested coastal headwater catchments,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream temperature controls a number of biological, chemical, and physical processes occurring in aquatic environments. Transient snow cover and advection associated with lateral throughflow inputs can have a dominant influence on stream thermal regimes for headwater catchments in the rain-on-snow zone. Most existing stream temperature models lack the ability to properly simulate these processes. We developed and evaluated a conceptual-parametric catchment-scale stream temperature model that includes the role of transient snow cover and lateral advection associated with throughflow. The model consists of routines for simulating canopy interception, snow accumulation and melt, hillslope throughflow runoff and temperature, and stream channel energy exchange processes. The model was used to predict discharge and stream temperature for a small forested headwater catchment near Vancouver, Canada, using long-term (1963-2013) weather data to compute model forcing variables. The model was evaluated against 4 years of observed stream temperature. The model generally predicted daily mean stream temperature accurately (annual RMSE between 0.57 and 1.24 degrees C) although it overpredicted daily summer stream temperatures by up to 3 degrees C during extended low streamflow conditions. Model development and testing provided insights on the roles of advection associated with lateral throughflow, channel interception of snow, and surface-subsurface water interactions on stream thermal regimes. This study shows that a relatively simple but process-based model can provide reasonable stream temperature predictions for forested headwater catchments located in the rain-on-snow zone.Show less"

The geochemical profile of streambed piston-cored sediments and the solute concentrations of the hyporheic pore water and surface water were also determined. Sediments are characterized by high concentrations of As, Cd, Tl, Sb, Ni, Cu, Zn, besides Al, Mn, and Fe. The As and Fe are closely coupled, indicating that iron oxyhydroxide precipitation plays a major role in controlling As sequestration. Mn oxides likely act as a sorbent for Zn, Ni, Sb, and Pb. Downstream geochemical trends indicate that precipitation and sorption represent the natural attenuation processes controlling the PTE loading released from the contaminated acidic effluents. The obtained results highlight that the Baccatoio stream sediments may act as secondary pollution sources via redox cycling, allowing contaminant remobilization to surface- and ground-water across the streambed, affecting the stream environment and aquatic biota.Show less"
18,"Doeblin, D",May 2022 ,Utilizing social science data from river recreationists to inform river management,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"River recreation often contributes to ecological degradation - a primary concern for river management professionals. Using social science data to inform ecological management helps mitigate recreational impacts, particularly at sites that experience high recreation use. This paper demonstrates the utility of an approach to collect, display, and use social data based on an indicators and thresholds approach at Buffalo National River in Arkansas (BUFF). Specifically, we presented a series of digitally manipulated photographs to river recreationists at BUFF that depicted varying levels of use, or density of use, to identify social thresholds - the levels of use deemed unacceptable by river users. We coupled the photos with quantitative questionnaires and found that paddlers, anglers, and campers thought that moderate to high-density levels were unacceptable. Pairing such data with empirical evidence of ecological degradation born from recreation use (e.g., erosion, water quality issues) provides a robust and defensible justification for a range of management actions, including altering use levels and river access. The research methods presented in this paper are transferable to a range of high-use rivers and waterways, and thus provide a blueprint for river professionals who by design or default interface with recreation and ecological resources. In the end, combining social and ecological data can fortify management decisions and decrease associated conflicts among important groups of river recreationists.Show less"
19,"Mahdi, TF",Jun 2009 ,Applications of a semi-two-dimensional numerical model for river morphological change prediction,NATURAL HAZARDS,"This paper presents some applications of MHYSER 1.0, the newly developed Model for the HYdraulics of SEdiments in Rivers, version 1.0. MHYSER 1.0 is a semi-two-dimensional model using the stream tubes concept to achieve lateral variations of velocity, flow stresses, and sediment transport rate. This is a new tool to address rivers' natural hazards predictions. The sediment routing and bed adjustments calculations are accomplished separately along each stream tube taking into account lateral mass exchanges. To test the model behaviors, MHYSER 1.0 is applied to four test cases. The first example is used to perform water surface profile calculations without sediment transport. The second problem shows MHYSER 1.0 performances regarding movable river beds. For the third application, MHYSER 1.0 is applied to a reach of the Ha! Ha! River (Quebec, Canada), a tributary of the Saguenay River, for the 1996 ""downpour.'' The results show a very good correlation of results with those collected in situ. Finally, an application to a reach of the Outaouais River (Quebec, Canada) shows the use of riverbank stability option to produce the risk area in case of a dam break occurrence upstream. These applications show the capabilities of the new model and predict its promising role in solving complex real cases.Show less"
20,"Anderson, CJ",Sep 2012 ,SEASONAL PATTERNS OF RIVER CONNECTIVITY AND SALTWATER INTRUSION IN TIDAL FRESHWATER FORESTED WETLANDS,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Hydrology can be difficult to interpret in tidal freshwater forested wetlands because of several influencing factors including river discharge, tidal stage, local precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater and prevailing winds. River discharge and tidal stage are considered the primary factors affecting these wetlands and both vary on a seasonal basis and have potential implications for wetland saltwater intrusion. We examined the hydrologic patterns of tidal freshwater swamps along the lower reach (20?km) of the Apalachicola River system in northwest Florida, USA. Water level recorders were installed in five wetlands along this reach and recorded ground and surface water levels at 15-min intervals from December 2006 to April 2009 (non-continuously). Seasonal trends related to flooding frequency and duration were compared to long term (20002008) records of creek and river salinities measured in the tidal freshwater forested zone. Tidal freshwater swamps tended to maintain a narrow water level range (often +/- 20?cm of the ground surface) except during high river flows (>680?cms or 24?000?cfs) when levels increased 1 to 2?m above ground and dampened tidal effects. All tidal forested wetlands had the highest mean water levels and most days tidally pulsed during the JulOct season which coincided with peak river/creek salinities and low river-flows associated with drought conditions. We explored the implications for the timing of salt water intrusion in these swamps and potential changes related to sea level rise and water management in the Apalachicola River drainage basin.

This study started with the characteristics of RPAs and chose China's Sichuan Province as the case for the present study, based on its characteristics of biodiversity conservation value and other characteristic elements. The study selected the river dendritic connectivity index and the other four indicators adding them according to different weights to calculate the comprehensive protected value (CPV) area. Finally, the existing PA distributions within the CPV were compared, and the priority conservation area was identified. The main conclusions are as follows: the total area of high-value areas is about 175,068 km(2), accounting for 36.02% of the province and concentrated in the high mountain plateaus of the northwest and the southwest mountain region; the existing PAs are 131,687 km(2) in sized, covering only 25.08% of the high-value areas of CPV. In other words, 74.92% of the high-value areas still have not been effectively protected, and the construction of RPAs is relatively lagging in these areas; the total area of priority conservation areas (PCAs) is 131,162 km(2), accounting for about 26.99% of the province. The total length of the reach in the PCAs is about 9190.72 km, which is approximately 26.84% of the length of the province's alternative reaches. The research can provide a scientific basis for the optimization and integration of nature protected areas and land space planning.Show less"
23,"Yaman, B",Dec 2020 ,Spatial variations of linear and cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes in a river basin and their air-water exchange,ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Linear and cyclic volatile methylsiloxanes (VMS) are Si and O containing organic compounds that are increasingly subject to scientific studies in recent years. They are used as solvents and coating materials in personal care products, cleaning materials and industrial applications. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the spatial variations of VMS levels in river water and ambient air in Kucuk Menderes Basin and their air-water exchange patterns. Grab river water samples and passive ambient air samples collected from 10 sites throughout Kucuk Menderes Basin located in Izmir region in Turkey, and they were analyzed for VMS. The concentrations of Sigma VMS in river water and ambient air ranged from 48.4 to 148 ng L-1 and from 41.7 to 433 ng m(-3), respectively. Among the VMS compounds, the predominant compounds were found to be D5 and D3 in ambient air and river water, respectively. In general, concentrations of all VMS congeners increased towards downstream of the river for both water and ambient air samples and there were substantial fluctuations between the sampling points. These fluctuations may be due to wastewater discharges at some sites (increase), followed by loss by volatilization along the river (decrease). VMS concentrations measured in air and river water samples were used to estimate the net air-water exchange fluxes. In all cases, fluxes were negative, ranging between -159 (L4) and -11100 (D3) ng m(-2) day, indicating volatilization from water is a source for atmospheric VMS.Show less"
24,"Boulton, AJ",2006 ,"Rivers as groundwater-dependent ecosystems: a review of degrees of dependency, riverine processes and management implications",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,"Many rivers are classified as groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs), owing to the contribution of groundwater to their base flow. However, there has been little explicit recognition of the way groundwater influences riverine biota or processes, how degrees of ecological dependency may vary, and the management implications of this dependency. The permeable beds and banks of these GDEs where surface water and groundwater exchange are termed 'hyporheic zones'. They are often inhabited by invertebrates, with varying reliance on groundwater, although the ecological roles of these invertebrates are little known. Upwelling hyporheic water can promote surface primary productivity, influence sediment microbial activity, and affect organic matter decomposition. In many intermittent streams, variable groundwater inputs alter the duration of flow or water permanence, and the duration and timing of these largely govern the biota and rates of many ecosystem processes ( e. g. leaf decomposition). Not only is the physical presence of water important, thermal and chemical conditions arising from groundwater inputs also have direct and indirect effects on riverine biota and rates or types of in-stream processes. Differing degrees of dependency of rivers on groundwater mediate all these influences, and may change over time and in response to human activities. Alteration of groundwater inputs through extraction from riparianwells or changes in localwater table have an impact on these GDEs, and some current management plans aim to restrict groundwater extraction from near permeable river channels. However, these are often 'blanket' restrictions and the mechanisms of GDE dependency or timing of groundwater requirements are poorly understood, hampering refinement of this management approach. More effective management of these GDEs into the future can result only from a better understanding of the mechanisms of the dependency, how these vary among river types and what in-stream changes might be predicted from alteration of groundwater inputs.Show less"
25,"Rasera, MDFL",Dec 2013 ,Spatial and temporal variability of pCO(2) and CO2 efflux in seven Amazonian Rivers,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Current estimates of CO2 outgassing from Amazonian rivers and streams have considerable uncertainty since they are based on limited-time surveys of pCO(2) measurements along the Amazon mainstem and mouths of major tributaries, using conservative estimates of gas exchange velocities. In order to refine basin-scale CO2 efflux estimates from Amazonian rivers, we present a long time (5-year) dataset of direct measurements of CO2 fluxes, gas transfer velocities and pCO(2) measurements in seven representative rivers of the lowland Amazon basin fluvial network, six non-tidal (Negro, Solimes, Teles Pires, Cristalino, Araguaia and Java,s) and one tidal river (Caxiuan), with sizes ranging from 4th to 9th order. Surveys were conducted from January 2006 to December 2010, in a total of 389 campaigns covering all stages of their hydrographs. CO2 fluxes and gas transfer velocities (k) were measured using floating chambers and pCO(2) was measured simultaneously by headspace extraction followed by gas chromatography analysis. Results show high CO2 flux rate variability among rivers and hydrograph stages, ranging from -0.8 to 15.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), with unexpected negative fluxes in clear-water rivers during low waters. Non-tidal rivers showed marked seasonal CO2 flux patterns, with significantly higher exchange during high waters. Seasonality was modulated by pCO(2), which was positive and strongly correlated with discharge. In these rivers k was well correlated with wind speed, which allowed the use of wind data to model k. We estimate a release of 360 +/- A 60 Tg C year(-1) from Amazonian rivers and streams within a 1.47 million km(2) quadrant in the central lowland Amazon. Extrapolating these values to the basin upstream of A""bidos, results in an outgassing of 0.8 Pg C to the atmosphere each year. Our results are a step forward in achieving more accurate gas emission values for Amazonian rivers and their role in the annual carbon budget of the Amazon basin.Show less"
26,"Zanandrea, F",May 1 2019 ,"Evaluation of different DTMs in sediment connectivity determination in the Mascarada River Watershed, southern Brazil",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"The study of sediment connectivity based on the geomorphic characteristics of the watershed has gained interest during the last decades. The calculation of connectivity indexes for a mountainous watershed that is normally susceptible to landslides allows the recognition of the unstable areas that have higher connection to any point such as the watershed outlet. Thus, the knowledge of spatial patterns of connectivity within the watershed is very useful in the sediment-related disaster management because the connectivity provides useful information on sediment pathways. The objective of the present study was to test four different global DTMs to compute the sediment connectivity index (IC) in the Mascarada river watershed (320 km(2)), southern Brazil. By analyzing the land use for each pixel, the Manning roughness was determined and used for the weighting factor in IC calculation. Field survey and satellite image analysis showed that 420 landslides occurred in this watershed on January 5th, 2017. The calculated IC value maps demonstrated that the hillslopes with landslide occurrences have higher values of IC. Among the tested DTMs, the one with the highest resolution (12.5-m resolution DTM) showed the best representation of the flow paths with high IC values. For all the resolutions, the IC mean values of the landslides scars were larger compared to the remaining area of the hillslopes, where the landslides occurred, which implies higher connectivity of the landslides to the watershed outlet. The results also showed that the 12.5-m resolution DTM generated the lowest mean and the largest amplitude of IC values, differentiating areas with high and low connectivity. It is concluded that the global DTM (12.5-m) is capable to provide important information on sediment connectivity and that together with a landslide inventory it can be an important tool for sediment management in mountainous watersheds.

27,"Kokic, J",2018 ,High spatial variability of gas transfer velocity in streams revealed by turbulence measurements,INLAND WATERS,"Streams are major sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but current large-scale estimates are associated with high uncertainties because knowledge concerning the spatiotemporal control on stream emissions is limited. One of the largest uncertainties derives from the choice of gas transfer velocity (k(600)), which describes the physical efficiency of gas exchange across the water-atmosphere interface. This study therefore explored the variability in k(600 )and subsequent CO2 and CH4 emission rates within and across streams of different stream order (SO). We conducted, for the first time in streams, direct turbulence measurements using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) to determine the spatial variability in k(600) across a variety of scales with a consistent methodology. The results show high spatial variability in k(600) and corresponding CO2 and CH4 emissions at small spatial scales, both within stream reaches and across SO, especially during high discharge. The k(600) was positively related to current velocity and Reynolds number. By contrast, no clear relationship was found between k(600) and specific stream characteristics such as width and depth, which are parameters often used in empirical models of k(600). Improved understanding of the small-scale variability in the physical properties along streams, especially during high discharge, is therefore an important step to reduce the uncertainty in existing gas transfer models and emissions for stream systems. The ADV method was a useful tool for revealing spatial variability in this work, but it needs further development. We recommend that future studies conduct measurements over shorter time periods (e.g., 10-15 min instead of 40 min) and at more sites across the reach of interest, and thereby derive more reliable mean-reach k(600) as well as more information about controls on the spatial variability in k(600).Show less"
28,"Hermoso, V",Mar 2021 ,Conservation planning across realms: Enhancing connectivity for multi-realm species,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Connectivity plays a key role in biodiversity conservation as it sustains ecological processes, such as migrations, important for the maintenance of populations. Connectivity is especially relevant for species that rely on different realms during their life cycle or use different realms daily or seasonally (multi-realm species). However, efforts to address conservation across multiple realms have focused on identifying priority areas for conservation in a single realm (mostly marine) while accounting for threats propagating from other realms or single species needs.Here, we demonstrate how to identify priority areas for conservation across three different realms (freshwater-terrestrial, estuary and marine) for multiple species, including some multi-realm species, that inhabit or move across the three realms, using the Tagus River (Western Iberian Peninsula), its estuary and nearby marine area as a case study. We integrated multiple types of connectivity in the selection of priority areas for conservation, each of them customised to depict important drivers of movement within each realm and across realms: longitudinal connectivity along rivers or multidimensional connectivity in the estuary and marine realms, guided by currents and depth similarity, respectively. We compared the allocation of priority areas and spatial connectivity achieved under three scenarios: no-connectivity, within-realm and cross-realm connectivity scenarios.There were differences in the spatial allocation of priority areas across scenarios. The most remarkable difference laid on the connectivity achieved under each scenario, which experienced a threefold increase when considering connectivity across realms, compared to solutions that considered only connectivity within each realm independently. This improvement in connectivity was especially marked for species that occur across different realms. There were, however, trade-offs between this improvement in connectivity and the increase in the number of planning units selected, especially in the estuary.Synthesis and applications. Addressing connectivity across realms deserves special attention when planning for the conservation of multi-realm species to ensure the adequacy of conservation recommendations to respond to the needs of multi-realm species. Given the potential trade-offs between enhanced cross-realm connectivity and total area needed or internal within-realm connectivity, consideration of cross-realm connectivity must be cautiously evaluated and integrated in multi-realm conservation plans.Show less"
29,"Naranjo, RC",Jun 2013 ,Using heat as a tracer to estimate spatially distributed mean residence times in the hyporheic zone of a riffle-pool sequence,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Biochemical reactions that occur in the hyporheic zone are highly dependent on the time solutes that are in contact with sediments of the riverbed. In this investigation, we developed a 2-D longitudinal flow and solute-transport model to estimate the spatial distribution of mean residence time in the hyporheic zone. The flow model was calibrated using observations of temperature and pressure, and the mean residence times were simulated using the age-mass approach for steady-state flow conditions. The approach used in this investigation includes the mixing of different ages and flow paths of water through advection and dispersion. Uncertainty of flow and transport parameters was evaluated using standard Monte Carlo and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method. Results of parameter estimation support the presence of a low-permeable zone in the riffle area that induced horizontal flow at a shallow depth within the riffle area. This establishes shallow and localized flow paths and limits deep vertical exchange. For the optimal model, mean residence times were found to be relatively long (9-40.0 days). The uncertainty of hydraulic conductivity resulted in a mean interquartile range (IQR) of 13 days across all piezometers and was reduced by 24% with the inclusion of temperature and pressure observations. To a lesser extent, uncertainty in streambed porosity and dispersivity resulted in a mean IQR of 2.2 and 4.7 days, respectively. Alternative conceptual models demonstrate the importance of accounting for the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in simulating mean residence times in a riffle-pool sequence.Show less"
30,"Wang, Q",May 1 2021 ,Enhancement of lateral connectivity promotes the establishment of plants in saltmarshes,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Several studies have shown that enhancing lateral hydrological connectivity in river systems can increase the exchange of materials and energy, and improves species diversity, which suggests that it might be a useful ecological restoration tool. The variation in elevation gradient across a saltmarsh system is small, which means that lateral hydrological connectivity in saltmarsh systems is often ignored and the ecological effects caused by the variation in lateral hydrological connectivity are seldom studied. lateral hydrological connectivity presents when a hydrological connection between marsh plain and tidal creek occurs, as a time interval during which tidal flow occurred. This study explored the effects of enhancing lateral hydrological connectivity on the plant life history process using empirical studies. The enhancement of lateral hydrological connectivity on a temporal scale was achieved by placing hollowed microtopographic structures on the marsh. Data obtained through the high-frequency monitoring of tidal levels was used to calculate lateral hydrological connectivity enhancement, and field control experiments were used to determine the effects of lateral connectivity enhancement on seed retention, emergence, and seedling survival at each life stage. The results showed that lateral hydrological connectivity decreased with the increasing distance to sea and the lateral distance to tidal creek. The hollowed microtopographic structures significantly enhanced lateral hydrological connectivity on the marsh, increased soil moisture content, and reduced soil salinity. Furthermore, seed retention time was significantly increased during dispersal stage, and potential seed establishment was improved. During the emergence and growth stages, the enhanced soil moisture and reduced salinity facilitated the emergence and growth of seeds and seedlings. These effects benefit plant re-establishment in bare areas, especially in areas with low lateral hydrological connectivity. This information could be used to improve the restoration or recovery of vegetation on bare or degraded saltmarshes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
31,"Zamora, HA",Oct 2013 ,Post-dam sediment dynamics and processes in the Colorado River estuary: Implications for habitat restoration,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"River-sea connectivity is essential for restoring ecosystem services in the Colorado River delta. The mixing of river water and seawater sustains biodiversity and provides brackish-water nursery grounds for both commercially important and endangered marine species. The Colorado River no longer reaches the sea except during particularly high tides and anomalously wet years. The river's relict channel is now obstructed by an accumulation of sediments deposited during flood tides; ebb flows are not strong enough to keep the channel open. Landsat 5-TM and Landsat-7 scenes from the Colorado River delta and tide prediction tables were used to reconstruct river-sea connectivity and geomorphic processes after 50 years of extensive human manipulation of the Colorado River. Historical documentation, previous topographic surveys and sediment cores were used to estimate sedimentation rates in the lower river channel. Satellite images and tide charts show that currently the river reaches the sea or the sea reaches the river about 12 days per year, unlike 10 years ago when a year-round connection existed. Reduction in connectivity results from the evolution of a tidal sandbar located within the bedload convergence zone, about 35 km upstream from the river's mouth. Historical documentation and sediment core analyses suggest sedimentation rates in the range of 10-21 cm per year. With the current conditions prevailing, active management - dredging - is required and needs to occur once every 5-10 years to reconnect the remaining riparian wetlands in the Colorado River to the Gulf of California.

32,"Karim, F",May 2020 ,Modelling Flood-Induced Wetland Connectivity and Impacts of Climate Change and Dam,WATER,"Hydrological connectivity between rivers and wetlands is considered one of the key critical factors for the integrity of floodplain landscapes. This study is a comprehensive modelling exercise on quantifying flood-induced wetland connectivity and the potential impacts of climate and water storage in an unregulated river basin in northern Australia. Flood inundation was simulated using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model and the connectivities between wetlands and rivers were calculated using geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS. Wetlands in the floodplain were identified using waterbody maps derived from satellite imagery. A broadly representative sample of 20 wetlands were selected from 158 wetlands in the Mitchell basin considering location, size and spatial distribution. Five flood events ranging from 1 in 2 to 1 in 100 years were investigated to evaluate how connectivity changes with flood magnitude. Connectivities were assessed for the current condition as well as for two scenarios of future climate (Cwet and Cdry) and one scenario of dam storage. Results showed that a 1 in 100 years event inundated about 5450 km(2) of land compared to 1160 km(2) for a 1 in 2 years event. Average connectivity of wetlands in the Mitchell basin varies from 1 to 5 days for the floods of 1 in 2 to 1 in 26 years. As expected, a large flood produces longer duration of connectivity relative to a small flood. Results also showed that reduction in mean connectivity under a dryer climate (up to 1.8 days) is higher than the possibility of increase under a wet climate (up to 1 day). The impacts of a water storage, in the headwater catchment, are highly pronounced in terms of inundation and wetland connectivity (e.g., mean connectivity reduced by 1.7 days). The relative change in connectivity is higher for a small flood compared to that of a large event. These results demonstrate that there is a possibility of both increase and decease in connectivity under future climate. However, any water storage will negatively impact the connectivity between floodplain waterbodies and thus reduce the material exchange resulting in a reduction in primary and secondary productions in rivers and wetlands.Show less"
33,"Williams, JE",Aug 2018 ,"Fish Occurrence in a Seasonally Inundated Floodplain of the Willamette River, Oregon",NORTHWEST SCIENCE,"The dynamic nature of large rivers is often diminished by anthropogenic alterations resulting in simplified stream networks with decreased floodplain connectivity and ecological function which adversely impact native organisms. However, little is known about the importance of large river floodplains to fish communities in the Pacific Northwest, especially during winter high flows. Our objectives were to document seasonal use of a Willamette River floodplain for native and nonnative fish by measuring: 1) fish community characteristics (species richness, native versus non-native status, relative abundance), 2) spawning and rearing, 3) timing of use and movement, and 4) use by federally protected juvenile spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). During fall 2011 through spring 2012, a floodplain was sampled with a backpack electrofisher and out-migrant trap. A total of 12 native and 11 non-native species were detected. During nine electrofishing samples, 691 fish were collected, of which 95% were native. An estimated 42,297 fish were captured by the out-migrant trap; 98% of which were native and most were age-0 threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Native species were detected on the floodplain prior to non-native species and tended to emigrate from the floodplain before non-native species, leading to a higher potential of stranding for non-native species as waters recedes. This study documents use of floodplain habitat by native and non-native fish species for seasonal flood refuge, rearing and spawning. Our results demonstrate native fish communities could potentially benefit from conservation of existing floodplains and restoration of floodplains changed by land use practices and altered flow regimes.Show less"
34,"Shi, Q",Jun 2 2019 ,Coupling Ocean Currents and Waves with Wind Stress over the Gulf Stream,REMOTE SENSING,"This study provides the first detailed analysis of oceanic and atmospheric responses to the current-stress, wave-stress, and wave-current-stress interactions around the Gulf Stream using a high-resolution three-way coupled regional modeling system. In general, our results highlight the substantial impact of coupling currents and/or waves with wind stress on the air-sea fluxes over the Gulf Stream. The stress and the curl of the stress are crucial to mixed-layer energy budgets and sea surface temperature. In the wave-current-stress coupled experiment, wind stress increased by 15% over the Gulf Stream. Alternating positive and negative bands of changes of Ekman-related vertical velocity appeared in response to the changes of the wind stress curl along the Gulf Stream, with magnitudes exceeding 0.3 m/day (the 95th percentile). The response of wind stress and its curl to the wave-current-stress coupling was not a linear combination of responses to the wave-stress coupling and the current-stress coupling because the ocean and wave induced changes in the atmosphere showed substantial feedback on the ocean. Changes of a latent heat flux in excess of 20 W/m(2) and a sensible heat flux in excess of 5 W/m(2) were found over the Gulf Stream in all coupled experiments. Sensitivity tests show that sea surface temperature (SST) induced difference of air-sea humidity is a major contributor to latent heat flux (LHF) change. Validation is challenging because most satellite observations lack the spatial resolution to resolve the current-induced changes in wind stress curls and heat fluxes. Scatterometer observations can be used to examine the changes in wind stress across the Gulf Stream. The conversion of model data to equivalent neutral winds is highly dependent on the physics considered in the air-sea turbulent fluxes, as well as air-sea temperature differences. This sensitivity is shown to be large enough that satellite observations of winds can be used to test the flux parameterizations in coupled models.Show less"
35,"Griebling, SA",Aug 2013 ,Adjoint modeling of stream depletion in groundwater-surface water systems,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Groundwater pumping may lead to reduction in surface water flows, which can compromise water supplies and habitat. In light of these threats, the need to minimize stream depletion, defined as the reduction in the flow rate in streams and rivers caused by groundwater pumping, becomes paramount. We develop adjoint equations to calculate stream depletion due to aquifer pumping. We consider a coupled groundwater and surface water system in which both the river head and river flow rate are impacted by drawdown in the aquifer as a result of pumping. Through an illustrative example, we show that the adjoint method for calculating stream depletion produces accurate results if the model is approximately linear. With only one simulation of the adjoint equations, stream depletion can be calculated for pumping at a well at any location in the model domain, which results in a substantial reduction in computational time as compared to the standard method of calculating stream depletion.Key Points  Adjoint models accurately calculate stream depletion due to aquifer pumping. The adjoint method is computationally efficient in calculating stream depletion. Standard groundwater flow codes can be adapted to solve the adjoint model.Show less"

In this study, we examined relationships between river hydrology and lateral hydrological connectivity, which is crucial to directing fluxes of water, material, and organisms into and across a floodplain. We did so by translating measures of river discharge for the Congaree River into high resolution maps of flood conditions for the floodplain at Congaree National Park using a 2D flood inundation model. Utilizing a graph network approach, we then analyzed the connectivity of a key wetland ecosystem, Taxodium-Nyssa forested swamps, to the main stem river and to each other under different flows. Our results underscore that floodplain connectivity is initiated at sub-bankfull discharges and does not depend on levee overtopping, while also clarifying that various sources of connectivity are triggered at different flow levels in specific reaches. Further, our findings demonstrate the sensitive and non-linear response of floodplain connectivity to river flows and provide useful information to facilitate the management of flood processes in the Congaree River watershed.

38,"Pryet, A",Jan 2015 ,Reporting of Stream-Aquifer Flow Distribution at the Regional Scale with a Distributed Process-Based Model,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"Groundwater withdrawals can reduce aquifer-to-stream flow and induce stream-to-aquifer flow. These effects involve potential threats over surface water and groundwater quantity and quality. As a result, the description of stream-aquifer flow in space and time is of high interest for water managers. In this study, the EauDyssee platform, an integrated groundwater/surface water model is extended to provide the distribution of stream-aquifer flow at the regional scale. The methodology is implemented over long periods (17 years) in the Seine river basin (76 375 km(2), France) with a 6 481 km long simulated river network. The study scale is compatible with the scale of interest of water authorities, which is often larger than study scales of research projects. Net and gross stream-aquifer exchange flow are computed at the daily time step over the whole river network at a resolution of 1 km. Simulation results highlight that a major proportion of the main stream network (82 %) is supplied by groundwater. Groundwater withdrawals induce a reduction of net aquifer-to-stream flow (-19 %) at the basin scale and flow reversals in the vicinity of pumping locations. Such an integrated model provided at the appropriate regional scale is an essential tool provided to water managers for the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.Show less"
39,"Marr, KR",Mar 15 2017 ,"Chemical weathering trends in fine-grained ephemeral stream sediments of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"We investigated chemical weathering trends within the fine-grained (<63 mu m; silt and clay) fraction of sediments collected from meltwater streams emanating from glaciers in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV; Wright and Taylor Valleys) by integrating grain size, BET surface area, and whole-rock geochemistry. While both valleys currently host cold-based glaciers, the sediment underlying the ephemeral glacial streams was deposited under differing glacial conditions. In Wright Valley (Clark Glacier stream), Brownworth and Trilogy drifts were deposited via cold-based glaciation, whereas the Ross Sea drift that underlies Delta Stream in Taylor Valley likely reflects contributions from wet-based ice. Wright Valley stream sediments are typically coarser grained and have a higher silt content as compared to Taylor Valley sediments. These sediments consist primarily of pyroxenes, quartz, and feldspars, with the percentages of pyroxenes and quartz systematically increasing downstream. The percentage of phyllosilicates ranges from 4 to 18% and decreases with downstream distance. In contrast, Taylor Valley sediments (Delta Stream) are finer-grained and exhibit lower percentages of both pyroxene and quartz and a significantly higher percentage of phyllosilicates (30-43%). Concentrations of all mineral phases remain relatively consistent in abundance with downstream transport in the Delta Stream transect as compared to Clark Glacier stream sediments. Standard chemical weathering indices, such as the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), indicate that chemical weathering is occurring within the silt and clay fractions of Antarctic stream sediments and is particularly pronounced in Delta Stream sediments that have BET surface area measurements >40 m(2)/g. Utilization of MFW (mafic-felsic-weathered) and A-CN-K (Al2O3-CaO + Na2O-K2O plots, however, are more effective in discerning the extent and nature of chemical weathering in these stream systems. Ca and Na depletion observed within the sediments exhibiting the highest surface area in Delta Stream suggest that chemical weathering may result in pitting and/or incongruent dissolution of pyroxenes and feldspars, as well as the development of amorphous and/or nanophase weathering products. In contrast, Clark Glacier stream sediments do not have similar leaching trends in the fine-grained sediment fraction and exhibit minimal weathering overall. This may suggest that fine-grained material is being trapped on top of the Clark Glacier surface and has not yet been transported into the weathering environment of the hyporheic zone due to timing of sampling. Alternatively, complete dissolution of very fine-grained sediment could be occurring in this stream transect, and is therefore not preserved in the fine sediment fraction. Overall, the magnitude of chemical weathering observed between the two stream systems is ultimately related to the nature of the underlying drift (cold and wet based drift deposition), dispersal patterns of eolian fines, and variable stream discharge rates. Thus, incorporation of local fine-grained sediment derived from the underlying glacial drift deposits and distributed via the varying wind regimes within the hyper-arid climate into active stream channels may facilitate incongruent mineral dissolution and development of weathering products, and ultimately influence the composition and concentration of meltwater stream solutes.

40,"Casanova, MT",Jul 2015 ,The seed bank as a mechanism for resilience and connectivity in a seasonal unregulated river,AQUATIC BOTANY,"The seed bank of a seasonally flowing river was sampled to assess ecosystem resilience and evidence of connectivity. Seed banks were sampled from 'Floodplain', 'Top of Bank' and 'In Channel' hydrogeomorphic areas in seven reaches of the Wannon River, and the distribution of species and water plant functional groups (WPFGs) among these sites was assessed. The seed bank material was exposed to two treatments (damp and flooded) to stimulate germination of terrestrial (Tdr Tda), flooding-tolerant (ATe, ATI, ARp, ATw) and flooding-dependent (ARf, Se, Sr, Sk) species. There was a high degree of similarity among seed banks from all parts of the river, and all hydrogeomorphic areas. Few species were restricted to any one area (i.e., 'In Channel', 'Top of Bank', 'Floodplain') or any one reach of the river. This indicates that the wetland areas of the Wannon River have a high degree of longitudinal and lateral connectivity, and the riparian zone retains the capacity to provide resources to wetland fauna, even with large variation in the natural flow regime and long-term agricultural land-use. Provided the seed bank remains intact, the perennial vegetation is allowed to regenerate, and a natural flow regime is maintained, seasonal rivers like the Wannon are likely to be resilient to the consequences of climate change, despite the surrounding agricultural land-use and the influx of saline ground-water.

41,"Sutton, AJ",May 2010 ,Effects of Restored Stream Buffers on Water Quality in Non-tidal Streams in the Choptank River Basin,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"Restoration of riparian buffers is an important component of nutrient reduction strategies in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In 1998, Maryland adopted a Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), which provides financial incentives to take agricultural land out of production to plant streamside vegetation. Between 1998 and 2005, 1-30% of streamside vegetation (average = 11%), was restored to forest or managed grass in 15 agriculturally dominated sub-basins in the Choptank River basin, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay. Pre-existing forested buffers represented 10-48% of the streamside (average = 33%), for a total of 12-61% buffered streamsides (average = 44%). Using multi-year water quality data collected before and after CREP implementation (1986, 2003-2006), we were unable to detect significant effects of CREP on baseflow nutrient concentrations based on the area of restored buffer, the percentage of restored streamside, or the percentage of total riparian buffer in the sub-basins (p > 0.05). Although CREP increased the average buffered streamside from 33% in the 1990s to 44% by 2005, N and P concentrations have not changed or have increased in some streams over the last 20 years. Reductions may not have occurred for the following reasons: (1) buffer age, width, and connectivity (gaps) between buffers are also important to nutrient reductions; (2) agricultural nutrient inputs may have increased during this period; and (3) riparian buffer restoration was not extensive enough by 2005 to have measurable affects on the stream water quality in these sub-basins. Significant effects of CREP may yet be resolved as the current CREP buffers mature; however, water quality data through 2006 in the Choptank basin do not yet show any significant effects.Show less"

45,"Mallard, J",Jun 2014 ,"Lateral inflows, stream-groundwater exchange, and network geometry influence stream water composition",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The role of stream networks and their hydrologic interaction with hillslopes and shallow groundwater in modifying and transporting watershed signals is an area of active research. One of the primary ways that stream networks can modify watershed signals is through spatially variable stream gains and losses, described herein as hydrologic turnover. We measured hydrologic gain and loss at the reach scale using tracer experiments throughout the Bull Trout watershed in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. We extended the results of reach scale experiments to the stream network using empirical relationships between (1) watershed area and stream discharge and (2) stream discharge and percent stream water loss to the groundwater system. We thus incorporate linkages between (1) hillslopes and stream networks via lateral inflows and (2) stream networks and shallow groundwater via hydrologic exchange. We implemented these relationships within a concise analytical framework to simulate hydrologic turnover across stream networks and estimate the variable influence exerted by upstream reaches and streamflow source locations on stream water composition across stream networks. Application to six natural Sawtooth watersheds and seven synthetic watersheds with varying topographic structure and stream network geometry indicated that contributions to discharge from any upstream source depend on the magnitude of the initial input, but also on the distribution of hydrologic turnover occurring along the stream network. The evolution of stream water source compositions along stream networks was unique in each watershed due to the combination of watershed structure and stream network geometry. Our results suggest that a distributed representation of hydrologic turnover at the stream network scale can improve understanding of how the stream network can modify source water compositions along the stream.Show less"
46,"McGuire, KJ",Oct 30 2010 ,Hydrological connectivity of hillslopes and streams: Characteristic time scales and nonlinearities,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Subsurface flow from hillslopes is widely recognized as an important contributor to streamflow generation; however, processes that control how and when hillslopes connect to streams remain unclear. We investigated stream and hillslope runoff dynamics through a wet-up period in watershed 10 of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascades of Oregon where the riparian zone has been removed by debris flows. We examined the controls on hillslope-stream connectivity on the basis of observations of hydrometric, stable isotope, and applied tracer responses and computed transit times for multiple runoff components for a series of storms during the wet-up phase of the 2002-2003 winter rainy season. Hillslope discharge was distinctly threshold-like with a near linear response and average quick flow ratio of 0.58 when antecedent rainfall was greater than 20 mm. Hillslope and stream stormflow varied temporally and showed strong hysteretic relationships. Event water mean transit times (8-34 h) and rapid breakthrough from applied hillslope tracer additions demonstrated that subsurface contributing areas extend far upslope during events. Despite rapid hillslope transport processes during events, soil water and runoff mean transit times during nonstorm conditions were greater than the time scale of storm events. Soil water mean transit times ranged between 10 and 25 days. Hillslope seepage and catchment base flow mean transit times were between 1 and 2 years. We describe a conceptual model that captures variable physical flow pathways, their synchronicity, threshold activation, hysteresis, and transit times through changing antecedent wetness conditions that illustrate the different stages of hillslope and stream connectivity.Show less"
47,"Stromberg, JC",Aug 2016 ,"Riparian plant guilds of ephemeral, intermittent and perennial rivers",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Plant functional types (or guilds) increasingly are being used to predict vegetation response to global changes. Continued human population growth coupled with projected warmer and drier climate will alter the hydrologic regimes of many arid-zone rivers, including intermittent rivers. We aimed to identify (i) woody plant guilds associated with distinct stream types of an arid region and (ii) plant traits indicating adaptation to the selective pressures of water availability and fluvial disturbance. We used hierarchical clustering to identify 11 plant guilds from floodplains, terraces and uplands of eight Arizona rivers that vary in surface flow permanence, depth to ground water and intensity of fluvial disturbance. Six guilds were riparian pioneers with small, wind-dispersed seeds, three guilds were late-seral, shade-tolerant riparian taxa with large animal-dispersed seeds, and two guilds were composed of desert xerophytes. Within the riparian pioneer and seral groups, guilds varied in water acquisition and productivity traits including wood density and rooting depth. The community-weighted traits varied or covaried with water availability and fluvial disturbance. Root: shoot ratio, canopy height and leaf area were influenced strongly by water availability, with the latter two showing a nonlinear response to changes in water table depth. Leaf length increased, and wood density decreased, as sites become wetter and more fluvially disturbed. Community-weighted seed mass, seed dispersal and spinesence varied most strongly with elevation above thalweg (an indicator of decreasing fluvial disturbance). These analyses will enable prediction of changes in the relative abundance of plant types and plant traits in response to changes in stream flow regimes, such as shifts towards greater intermittency. The distribution patterns of guilds among riparian habitat types emphasise the importance of focusing conservation efforts not only on the limited number of perennial rivers remaining in arid regions, but also on intermittent and ephemeral rivers with shallow water tables.Show less"
48,"Cai, ZY",Feb 5 2022 ,Spatiotemporal variability of water exchanges in the Pearl River Estuary by interactive multiscale currents,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"Driven by interactive multiscale motions, the water exchange between the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and coastal seas exhibits complex spatial structures and significant temporal variability. In this study, the exposure time (theta) was calculated using the adjoint method to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of water exchange and illustrate the substance movement pathway in the PRE and the adjacent shelf. Seasonal variations in water exchange are generally determined by subtidal motion in the estuary and adjacent shelf. In summer, the theta gradually increases from approximately 5 days near the lower estuary to 15 days in the upper estuary. In winter, associated with the weaker river discharge and prevailing northeasterly winds, the water exchange is suppressed and theta increases to approximately 35 days in the upper estuary. Owing to the surface/bottom subtidal offshore/ onshore transport in the water column, the theta of the bottom water increases by 10 days compared to the surface water. Outside the estuary, the seasonally reversing shelf current and onshore transport move the shelf substance back into the PRE. The theta to the southwest and northeast of the PRE is approximately 5 and 10 days in summer and winter, respectively. Temporally, the interplay between the periodic tidal motion and shelf current induces a significant intra-tidal variation of theta, predominantly in the middle estuary, where the water exchange is sensitive to the initial release time. The theta with the initial release time of high/low tide generally has shorter/longer values. The intra-tidal variation of theta is approximately three days and two weeks in summer and winter, respectively. The distinct three-dimensional structure and intra-tidal variability of water exchange illustrated in this study help to better utilize fluid motion that refreshes the water inside the estuary.Show less"
49,"Aucour, AM",2013 ,Nitrogen patterns in subsurface waters of the Yzeron stream: effect of combined sewer overflows and subsurface-surface water mixing,WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"Urbanization subjects streams to increased nitrogen loads. Therefore studying nitrogen forms at the interface between urban stream and groundwater is important for water resource management. In this study we report results on water delta O-18 and nitrogen forms in subsurface waters of a stream (Yzeron, France). The sites studied were located upstream and downstream of combined sewer overflows (CSO) in a rural area and a periurban area, respectively. Water delta O-18 allowed us to follow the mixing of subsurface water with surface water. Dissolved organic nitrogen and organic carbon of fine sediment increased by 20-30% between rural and periurban subsurface waters in the cold season, under high flow. The highest nitrate levels were observed in rural subsurface waters in the cold season. The lowest nitrate levels were found in periurban subsurface waters in the warm season, under low flow. They corresponded to slow exchange of subsurface waters with channel water. Thus reduced exchange between surface and subsurface waters and organic-matter-rich input seemed to favor nitrate reduction in the downstream, periurban, subsurface waters impacted by CSO.Show less"
