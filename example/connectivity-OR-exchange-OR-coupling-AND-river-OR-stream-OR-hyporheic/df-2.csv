0,"Mojarrad, BB",Jul 2019 ,The Effect of Stream Discharge on Hyporheic Exchange,WATER,"Streambed morphology, streamflow dynamics, and the heterogeneity of streambed sediments critically controls the interaction between surface water and groundwater. The present study investigated the impact of different flow regimes on hyporheic exchange in a boreal stream in northern Sweden using experimental and numerical approaches. Low-, base-, and high-flow discharges were simulated by regulating the streamflow upstream in the study area, and temperature was used as the natural tracer to monitor the impact of the different flow discharges on hyporheic exchange fluxes in stretches of stream featuring gaining and losing conditions. A numerical model was developed using geomorphological and hydrological properties of the stream and was then used to perform a detailed analysis of the subsurface water flow. Additionally, the impact of heterogeneity in sediment permeability on hyporheic exchange fluxes was investigated. Both the experimental and modelling results show that temporally increasing flow resulted in a larger (deeper) extent of the hyporheic zone as well as longer hyporheic flow residence times. However, the result of the numerical analysis is strongly controlled by heterogeneity in sediment permeability. In particular, for homogeneous sediments, the fragmentation of upwelling length substantially varies with streamflow dynamics due to the contribution of deeper fluxes.Show less"
1,"Zhang, JL",Sep 2018 ,"Seasonal variability of hyporheic water exchange of the Weihe River in Shaanxi Province, China",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Interactions between surface water and groundwater play a major role in hydrological processes. Understanding the seasonal variations of the water exchange is important to clear drivers of water transferring in a catchment. However, the seasonal variations of water exchange have been limited by the resolution of methods and the experimental problems. In this paper, the Weihe River, in Shaanxi Province, China was chosen, as a case study area to access the seasonal variability of water exchange in the hyporheic zone (HZ). Five testing sites were in the main channel of the river, and seasonal field data were collected from fall 2012 to summer 2014. The temperature profiles and heat convection-diffusion equation were applied to analyze the hyporheic water exchange pattern (the type of movement) and its magnitude, as well as characterizing the seasonal variability of the water exchange features. The results indicate that the patterns and magnitudes of water exchange in the hyporheic zone vary significantly in seasons and test sites. The water exchange general in the fall season (71.5 mm/d) is larger than in other seasons (i.e., spring 54.14 mm/d, summer 56.19 mm/d and winter 23.26 mm/d). This study provides the guidelines for the water resources management in different seasons.Show less"
2,"Boano, F",Nov 2010 ,Effect of streamflow stochasticity on bedform-driven hyporheic exchange,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The interactions between the stream and the geomorphologic units that compose the stream channel result in an exchange of water, heat, and chemicals that is an important component of the flows of energy and nutrients in the river ecosystem. This exchange is characterized by complex spatial and temporal dynamics that depend on the characteristics of the stream flow and morphology. At present, many studies have addressed the development of spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange that are induced by many geomorphological factors at different scales. However, much less is known about the temporal evolution of the surface-subsurface exchange in response to the dynamics of the stream discharge. In order to investigate this problem, the present work analyzes the influence of streamflow variability on the hyporheic exchange induced by fluvial bedforms. A stochastic approach is employed to generate streamflow series whose statistical properties are representative of streams with different hydrological regimes. The resulting exchange fluxes and travel times are then computed, and the relationships between the streamflow regime and the dynamics of the exchange flux and travel times are investigated. The results show that the mean stream discharge can be used to estimate the average features of the temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange. Moreover, exchange fluxes and residence times distributions exhibit significant fluctuations, which are tightly related to the coefficient of variation of the streamflow hydrograph.

These experimental insights are catalyzing a renaissance in our understanding of the role stream turbulence plays in a host of critical ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling. In this commentary, we briefly review the nature of stream turbulence and its role in hyporheic exchange and nutrient cycling in streams. A simple process-based model, borrowed from biochemical engineering, provides the link between empirical relationships for grain-scale turbulent mixing and nutrient processing at reach, catchment, continental, and global scales.Show less"
4,"Liu, SN",May 2020 ,Optimal In-Stream Structure Design through Considering Nitrogen Removal in Hyporheic Zone,WATER,"The hyporheic zone (HZ), the region beneath or alongside a streambed, can play a vital role in a stream ecosystem. Previous studies have examined the impacts of in-stream structures on the HZ and river restoration; however, studies on optimizing the design of in-stream structures are still lacking. Therefore, this study aims to propose a method for optimizing the design of in-stream structures (e.g., weirs) through comprehensively considering both nitrogen removal amount (NRA) and nitrogen removal ratio (NRR) in the HZ based on numerical modelling. The Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) and COMSOL Multiphysics are employed for surface water and hyporheic flow simulations, respectively, and these two models are coupled by the hydraulic head along the surface of the streambed. The NRA and NRR are both closely related with residence time (RT), while the NRA is also influenced by hyporheic flux. Using the model outputs under different scenarios, regression equations for estimating the relevant variables (e.g., the maximum upstream distance in the subsurface flow influenced by the weir, the RT, and the hyporheic flux) are proposed. Then, the cumulative NRA (CNRA) and NRR can be calculated, and an objective function is formulated as the product of the normalized CNRA and NRR. The results show that the optimal height of the weir can be obtained based on the proposed method, and the validation shows the good general performance of this method. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the optimal height generally can be sensitive to the river discharge, i.e., the optimal height increases when the river discharge increases and vice versa. In addition, it is observed that, in the case of the optimal height, hyporheic flux increases when the slope increases while the influence of depth to bedrock on hyporheic flux is not significant. This study enhances our understanding of the optimal in-stream structure design, and potentially benefits river restoration in the face of continual degradation caused by human activities.Show less"

Many of the papers seminal to conceptual and empirical advances in hyporheic research have been published in J-NABS, reflecting stream benthologists' awareness of the relevance of processes and biota in the hyporheic zone However, major research gaps remain One is the need for further empirical data to test the predictions of several current conceptual frameworks that hypothesize conditions under which the hyporheic zone might be expected to contribute most to surface stream metabolism, especially in large rivers with shallow alluvial aquifers A second is how to apply research findings about the functional significance of the hyporheic zone to river restoration and conservation Many activities that restore or protect surface biota and habitats probably benefit hyporheic processes and fauna as well, but this prediction should be tested. Last, hyporheic exchange and the biogeochemical processes within the sediments occur across multiple hierarchical spatial scales, but we are vet to understand fully these interactions or to extrapolate Successfully across scales.

6,"Anderson, JK",Oct 15 2005 ,"Patterns in stream longitudinal profiles and implications for hyporheic exchange flow at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"There is a need to identify measurable characteristics of stream channel morphology that vary predictably throughout stream networks and that influence patterns of hyporheic exchange flow in mountain streams. In this paper we characterize stream longitudinal profiles according to channel unit spacing and the concavity of the water surface profile. We demonstrate that: (1) the spacing between zones of upwelling and downwelling in the beds of mountain streams is closely related to channel unit spacing; (2) the magnitude of the vertical hydraulic gradients (VHGs) driving hyporheic exchange flow increase with increasing water surface concavity, measured at specific points along the longitudinal profile; (3) channel unit spacing and water surface concavity are useful metrics for predicting how patterns in hyporheic exchange vary amongst headwater and mid-order streams. We use regression models to describe changes in channel unit spacing and concavity in longitudinal profiles for 12 randomly selected stream reaches spanning 62 km(2) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon. Channel unit spacing increased significantly, whereas average water surface concavity (AWSC) decreased significantly with increasing basin area. Piezometer transects installed longitudinally in a subset of stream reaches were used to measure VHG in the hyporheic zone, and to determine the location of upwelling and downwelling zones. Predictions for median pool length and median distance between steps in piezometer reaches bracketed the median distance separating zones of upwelling in the stream bed. VHG in individual piezometers increased with increasing water surface concavity at individual points in the longitudinal profile along piezometer transects. Absolute values of VHG, averaged throughout piezometer transects, increased with increasing AWSC, indicating increased potential for hyporheic exchange flow. These findings suggest that average hyporheic flow path lengths increase-and the potential for hyporheic exchange flow in stream reaches decreases-along the continuum from headwater to mid-order mountain streams.

7,"Zhang, GT",Apr 2017 ,Effect of bank curvatures on hyporheic water exchange at meter scale,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,"The micro-topography feature of a riverine system is a controlling attribute to induce the change of patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange. The study aims to determine how hyporheic water exchange is affected by the bank curvatures of test points at meter scale. A one-dimensional heat steady-state transport model was applied to determine patterns and magnitudes of vertical hyporheic water exchange in January and July 2015. The bank curvatures were calculated based on the curvature formula. The results demonstrate that vertical water exchange patterns of all test points were upwards during the two test periods, and the higher vertical fluxes mostly occurred in January 2015. Large curvatures for either sides of convex banks in the two periods resulted in higher vertical water exchange fluxes, and the significantly higher vertical fluxes occurred near the apex of bends. Additionally, a flow pattern from river bank discharging into stream was derived during the campaign in July 2015, and significantly higher fluxes were obtained along the straight bank where more riparian vegetation was adjacent to the bank/water interface. It can be suggested that the bank curvatures and riparian vegetation are considered the crucial attributes influencing hyporheic water exchange.Show less"

The presence of hyporheic zones in rivers play a role in the fate of pollutants in water systems. This paper studies pollutant transport in a natural river with hyporheic zone exchange and non-point source inflows. A non-point source, hyporheic exchange, Hybrid Cells in Series model is proposed and derived analytically. The proposed model is simulated under varying time delays between the hyporheic zone and the overflow channel. The Breakthrough curves produced from the simulations are in good agreement with field tracer test results, as presented in most studies. The model adequately captures the elongated arrival and trailing tails of field data breakthrough profiles. The proposed model's overall performance shows that the model adequately predicts pollutants' transport and fate along a natural river.Show less"
9,"Fox, A",May 16 2018 ,Interactions Between Suspended Kaolinite Deposition and Hyporheic Exchange Flux Under Losing and Gaining Flow Conditions,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Fine particle deposition and streambed clogging affect many ecological and biogeochemical processes, but little is known about the effects of groundwater flow into and out of rivers on clogging. We evaluated the effects of losing and gaining flow on the deposition of suspended kaolinite clay particles in a sand streambed and the resulting changes in rates and patterns of hyporheic exchange flux (HEF). Observations of clay deposition from the water column, clay accumulation in the streambed sediments, and water exchange with the bed demonstrated that clay deposition in the bed substantially reduced both HEF and the size of the hyporheic zone. Clay deposition and HEF were strongly coupled, leading to rapid clogging in areas of water and clay influx into the bed. Local clogging diverted exchanged water laterally, producing clay deposit layers that reduced vertical hyporheic flow and favored horizontal flow. Under gaining conditions, HEF was spatially constrained by upwelling water, which focused clay deposition in a small region on the upstream side of each bed form. Because the area of inflow into the bed was smallest under gaining conditions, local clogging required less clay mass under gaining conditions than neutral or losing conditions. These results indicate that losing and gaining flow conditions need to be considered in assessments of hyporheic exchange, fine particle dynamics in streams, and streambed clogging and restoration.Show less"
10,"Singley, JG",May 2021 ,The Role of Hyporheic Connectivity in Determining Nitrogen Availability: Insights From an Intermittent Antarctic Stream,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Due to widespread manipulation of nitrogen (N), much research has focused on processes controlling the fate of anthropogenic N in streams. Yet, in a variety of oligotrophic systems, N fixed by periphyton is a significant driver of ecosystem metabolism. Due to difficulties partitioning allochthonous and autochthonous sources, there is limited information regarding how the latter is processed. Autochthonous N may be particularly important in alpine, arid, or polar environments. We test the hypothesis that the availability of remineralized autochthonous N is controlled by connectivity between the hyporheic zone and main channel due to the contrasting biogeochemical functions of benthic autotrophs (including N-fixing Nostoc) and hyporheic heterotrophs in an intermittent Antarctic stream. There, we collected surface water and hyporheic water concurrently at 4-6 h intervals over a 32.5 h period during one flow season and opportunistically throughout a second. Hyporheic water had 7 to 30 times greater nitrate-N concentrations relative to surface water across all flow conditions. In contrast, ammonium concentrations were generally lower, although similar among locations. Additionally, nitrate in hyporheic water was positively correlated with silica, an indicator of hyporheic residence time. A laboratory assay confirmed prior inferences that hyporheic microbial communities possess the functional potential to perform nitrification. Together, these findings suggest that remineralized autochthonous N accumulates in the hyporheic zone even as streamflow varies and likely subsidizes stream N availability, which supports prior inferences from N stable isotope data at this site. These results highlight the importance of hyporheic connectivity in controlling autochthonous N cycling and availability in streams.Show less"
11,"Trauth, N",Sep 2013 ,Coupled 3-D stream flow and hyporheic flow model under varying stream and ambient groundwater flow conditions in a pool-riffle system,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Exchange of water and solutes across the stream-sediment interface is an important control for biogeochemical transformations in the hyporheic zone (HZ). In this paper, we investigate the interplay between turbulent stream flow and HZ flow in pool-riffle streams under various ambient groundwater flow conditions. Streambed pressures, derived from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, are assigned at the top of the groundwater model, and fluxes at the bottom of the groundwater model domain represent losing and gaining conditions. Simulations for different Reynolds numbers (Re) and pool-riffle morphologies are performed. Results show increasing hyporheic exchange flows (m(3)/d) for larger Re and a concurrent decrease in residence time (RT). Losing and gaining conditions were found to significantly affect the hyporheic flow field and diminish its spatial extent as well as rates of hyporheic exchange flow. The fraction of stream water circulating through the hyporheic zone is in the range of 1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-6) per meter stream length, decreasing with increasing discharge. Complex distributions of pressure across the streambed cause significant lateral hyporheic flow components with a mean lateral travel distance of 20% of the longitudinal flow paths length. We found that the relationship between pool-riffle height and hyporheic exchange flow is characterized by a threshold in pool-riffle amplitude, beyond which hyporheic exchange flow becomes independent of riffle height. Hyporheic residence time distributions (RTD) are log-normally distributed with medians ranging between 0.7 and 19 h.Show less"
12,"Cardenas, MB",Oct 2008 ,Residence time of bedform-driven hyporheic exchange,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Biogeochemical and ecological transformations in hyporheic zones are dependent on the timing of hyporheic exchange. We show through linked modeling of open channel turbulent flow, groundwater flow, and solute transport that the residence time distributions of solutes advected by hyporheic flow induced by current-bedform interaction follow power-laws. This tailing behavior of solutes exiting the sediments is explained by the presence of multiple path lengths coupled with very large variability in Darcy flow velocity, both occurring without heterogeneity in sediment permeability. Hyporheic exchange through bedforms will result in short-time fractal scaling of stream water chemistry. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
13,"Betterle, A",Mar 2021 ,Hyporheic exchange in recirculating flumes under heterogeneous bacterial and morphological conditions,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Hyporheic exchange (HE) contributes to the biogeochemical turnover of macro- and micro-pollutants in rivers. However, the spatiotemporal complexity and variability of HE hinder understanding of its role in the overall functioning of riverine ecosystems. The present study focuses on investigating the role of bacterial diversity and sediment morphology on HE using a multi-flume experiment. A fully coupled surface-subsurface numerical model was used to highlight complex exchange patterns between surface water and the underlying flow field in the sediments. Under the experimental conditions, the surface water flow induced by bedforms has a prominent effect on both local trajectories and residence time distributions of hyporheic flow paths, whereas mean hyporheic retention times are mainly modulated by average surface flowrates. In case of complex bedform morphologies, the numerical model successfully reproduces the HE estimated by means of salt dilution tests. However, the 2D numerical representation of the system falls short in predicting HE in absence of bedforms, highlighting the intrinsic complexity of water circulation patterns in real scenarios. Finally, results show that higher bacterial diversities in the stream sediments can significantly reduce hyporheic fluxes. This work provides a framework to interpret micropollutants turnover in light of the underlying physical transport processes in the hyporheic zone. The study emphasizes the importance of better understanding the tradeoff between physically driven transport processes and bacterial dynamics in the hyporheic zone to quantify the fate of pollutants in streams and rivers.Show less"

Wells were established beneath the wetted perimeter of the surface stream and beneath exposed alluvial sediments lateral to surface water. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was reduced in the interstitial environment (<50% saturation), but hyporheic water was enriched in nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Time-of-day and location of wells interacted significantly to produce distinct patterns of diel variation in NO3-N and SRP in wells located beneath the wetted perimeter. In lateral wells, NO3-N concentration showed significant spatial variation, but exhibited no significant variation among sampling times within a day. Vertical hydraulic gradient varied from +0.29 to -0.84 over a 90 m study reach and hydraulic heads varied by as much as 9 cm on a diel basis. Concentration and flux of NO3-N was greatest in surface water overlying upwelling regions at night when upwelling heads were greatest. Downstream decreases in NO3-N reflected loss of groundwater discharge into surface water and strong assimilatory demand by surface algal communities. Hydrologically mediated exchange can have strong influence on physical-chemical and biologic conditions in the hyporheic zone, benthic environment and associated surface water.Show less"
15,"des Chatelliers, MC",Mar 2021 ,Are hyporheic oligochaetes efficient indicators of hydrological exchanges in river bed sediment? A test in a semi-natural and a regulated river,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"River-groundwater exchanges are crucial for several ecological processes, but difficult to localize. Hyporheic oligochaetes may represent efficient biological indicators of these exchanges, but hydrological disturbance may alter oligochaete distribution and blur the spatial patterns of river-groundwater exchanges. Oligochaete assemblages were compared in the Drome River, which is a semi-natural braided river with an unmodified discharge, and the Ain River, which has reduced sediment mobility and hydropeaking due to several upstream dams. In the semi-natural river, the oligochaete distribution was mostly controlled by the origin of the water: some stygoxene species (e.g., Chaetogaster spp. and Vejdovskyella intermedia) were restricted to or more abundant in downwellings, whereas a set of stygophiles (e.g., Stylodrilus sp. and Cernovitoviella sp.) and stygobites (e.g., Aberrantidrilus cuspis) were present or more abundant only in upwellings. Species living in fine sediment (e.g., Potamothrix sp. and Tubifex sp.) also occurred in upwellings due to their location at the border of the braided strip. Conversely, in the regulated river, oligochaete assemblages were abundant and diversified, with species living in fine sediment being dominant in the partially clogged stations. The spatial distribution of most species did not follow typical surface-hyporheic exchange patterns: most stygophiles (e.g., Proppapus volki and Marionina argentea) and some stygobites (e.g., Haber turquini) were found in both upwellings and downwellings or even at stations without water exchanges (e.g., Rhyacodrilus balmensis). In rivers subjected to hydrological disturbance and hydropeaking, oligochaetes became poor indicators of river-groundwater exchanges.Show less"
16,"Boano, F",Jul 2013 ,Modeling hyporheic exchange with unsteady stream discharge and bedform dynamics,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Water exchange between streams and hyporheic zones is highly dynamic, and its temporal variation is related to the hydrologic fluctuations of stream discharge and groundwater levels. Unfortunately, predictions of temporal patterns of exchange are difficult due to the many hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes that are involved and also to their complex nonlinear interactions. Examples of these processes include the evolution of streambed morphology in response to changing streamflow as well as the feedback on surface flow induced by drag resistance due to evolving bed forms. In this work, we have employed a stochastic method to analyze the temporal dynamics of bed form-driven hyporheic exchange in a stream characterized by subcritical flow and daily discharge variations. The method is an extension of previous studies that includes current-induced alterations of bedform size and celerity and their effect on water exchange. The modeling results show that during high flows, stream water penetrates deeper and for longer times in the sediments. At the same time, the predicted rate of water exchange per unit streambed area decreases because the streambed area occupied by each bed form increases faster than the volumetric rate of stream water exchange induced by the same bed form. This reduction can be compensated by the increase in wetted area with discharge, which may provide additional streambed area for water exchange. One the main finding of the study is that the time-averaged values of exchange flux and depths are quite similar to those modeled for a steady mean discharge, while residence times are somewhat lower. Predicted temporal variations of exchange depths and times around their time-averaged values are moderate compared to steady state values.Show less"

Because it lies between two heavily exploited freshwater resources-rivers and groundwater-the hyporheic zone is vulnerable to impacts coming to it through both of these habitats, This review focuses on the direct and indirect effects of human activity on ecosystem functions of the hyporheic zone, River regulation, mining, agriculture, urban, and industrial activities all have the potential to impair interstitial bacterial and invertebrate biota and disrupt the hydrological connections between the hyporheic zone and stream, groundwater, riparian, and floodplain ecosystems. Until recently, our scientific ignorance of hyporheic processes has perhaps excused the inclusion of this ecotone in river management policy, However, this no longer is the case as we become increasingly aware of the central role that the hyporheic zone plays in the maintenance of water quality and as a habitat and refuge for fauna. To fully understand the impacts of human activity on the hyporheic zone, river managers need to work with scientists to conduct long-term studies over large stretches of river. River rehabilitation and protection strategies need to prevent the degradation of linkages between the hyporheic zone and surrounding habitats while ensuring that it remains isolated from toxicants. Strategies that prevent anthropogenic restriction of exchanges may include the periodic release of environmental flows to flush silt and reoxygenate sediments, maintenance of riparian buffers, effective land use practices, and suitable groundwater and surface water extraction policies.Show less"
19,"Huang, P",Jul 2021 ,Hyporheic Exchange in a Straight Pool-Riffle Stream With Floodplain,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange (HE) is the exchange between surface water, including suspended and dissolved matter, and pore water in the sediment surrounding a stream. It is essential to physicochemical and biological processes in both the stream and the surrounding sediment. This study systematically investigated the effects of the stream characteristics (i.e., stream discharge, bedform amplitude and wavelength, stream bed slope and groundwater flow) on the characteristics of HE (i.e., flowrate, scale, and residence time) in a straight pool-riffle stream with floodplain using laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The HE in the stream bank and streambed and its controlling factors were evaluated using numerical models. The results show that the HE flowrate and volume in the stream banks (i.e., in the floodplain) and streambed are significant and comparable at a high discharge. The discharge, bedform amplitude and bed slope directly affect the flow state in the pool, and the flow state determines the patterns of the effects of these three factors on the HE flowrate. The HE flowrate shows a linear relationship with discharge and bed slope when the surface flow in the pool remains subcritical. If the flow state in the pool changes from subcritical to supercritical conditions as discharge or bed slope increase, the HE flowrate becomes non-monotonic with discharge and it first increases and then decreases with increasing bed slope. The flowrate, scale, and flux-weighted mean residence time of HE linearly increase with bedform wavelength and exponentially decrease with both gaining and losing groundwater flow, independent of discharge.Show less"
20,"Siergieiev, D",Nov 15 2014 ,Flow regulation effects on the hydrogeochemistry of the hyporheic zone in boreal rivers,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River-aquifer interfaces are essential for ecosystem functioning in terms of nutrient exchange and biological habitat, but are greatly threatened world-wide. This study examined geochemical aspects of river-aquifer interaction in one regulated and one unregulated boreal river in Northern Sweden to determine whether the geochemical functioning of the hyporheic zone is affected by hydrological alterations, e.g. regulated river discharge and river-aquifer connectivity. In the unregulated Kalix River, the hyporheic pore water was well-oxygenated with orthogonal fluxes (approximate to 0.6-0.7 m d(-1)) and acted as a sink for Fe, Mn, Al, NH4, and Ca, with fractional losses of 95%, 92%, 45%, 31%, and 15%, respectively. A corresponding elevation in the concentrations of these elements in the hyporheic sediment was observed, with higher saturation indices of Fe-, Mn-, and Al-bearing secondary minerals in hyporheic waters. In the regulated Lule River, hydraulic connectivity at the river-aquifer interface was altered by the presence of a clogging layer (0.04 m d(-1)). In addition, the river discharge oscillated daily, severely reducing exchange flows across the riverbed (<0.01 m d(-1)). As a result, the hyporheic pore water was suboxic, with elevated concentrations of filtered Fe and Mn (fractional increases of approximate to 3700% and approximate to 2500%, respectively) and other solutes (NH4, Si, S, Ca). A conceptual model revealed functional differences between geochemical features of the hyporheic zone of regulated and unregulated rivers. Overall, the results showed that hyporheic processes are altered along regulated rivers, with resulting impacts on the geochemistry of riverine, riparian and related marine ecosystems.

21,"Gooseff, MN",Dec 7 2002 ,Weathering reactions and hyporheic exchange controls on stream water chemistry in a glacial meltwater stream in the McMurdo Dry Valleys,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, dilute glacial meltwater flows down well-established streambeds to closed basin lakes during the austral summer. During the 6-12 week flow season, a hyporheic zone develops in the saturated sediment adjacent to the streams. Longer Dry Valley streams have higher concentrations of major ions than shorter streams. The longitudinal increases in Si and K suggest that primary weathering contributes to the downstream solute increase. The hypothesis that weathering reactions in the hyporheic zone control stream chemistry was tested by modeling the downstream increase in solute concentration in von Guerard Stream in Taylor Valley. The average rates of solute supplied from these sources over the 5.2 km length of the stream were 6.1 x 10(-9) mol Si L-1 m(-1) and 3.7 x 10(-9) mol K L-1 m(-1), yielding annual dissolved Si loads of 0.02-1.30 mol Si m(-2) of watershed land surface. Silicate minerals in streambed sediment were analyzed to determine the representative surface area of minerals in the hyporheic zone subject to primary weathering. Two strategies were evaluated to compute sediment surface area normalized weathering rates. The first applies a best linear fit to synoptic data in order to calculate a constant downstream solute concentration gradient, dC/dx (constant weathering rate contribution, CRC method); the second uses a transient storage model to simulate dC/dx, representing both hyporheic exchange and chemical weathering (hydrologic exchange, HE method). Geometric surface area normalized dissolution rates of the silicate minerals in the stream ranged from 0.6 x 10(-12) mol Si m(-2) s(-1) to 4.5 x 10(-12) mol Si m(-2) s(-1) and 0.4 x 10(-12) mol K m(-2) s(-1) to 1.9 x 10(-12) mol K m(-2) s(-1). These values are an order of magnitude lower than geometric surface area normalized weathering rates determined in laboratory studies and are an order of magnitude greater than geometric surface area normalized weathering rates determined in a warmer, wetter setting in temperate basins, despite the cold temperatures, lack of precipitation and lack of organic material. These results suggest that the continuous saturation and rapid flushing of the sediment due to hyporheic exchange facilitates weathering in Dry Valley streams.Show less"
22,"Stofleth, JM",Jun 15 2008 ,"Hyporheic and total transient storage in small, sand-bed streams",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Key processes in stream ecosystems are linked to hydraulic retention, which is the departure of stream flow from ideal 'plug flow', and reflects fluid movement through surface and hyporheic storage zones. Most existing information about hyporheic exchange is based on flume studies or field measurements in relatively steep streams with beds coarser than sand. Stream tracer studies may be used to quantify overall hydraulic retention, but disaggregation of surface and hyporheic retention remains difficult. A stream tracer approach was used to compute the rates at which stream water is exchanged with water in storage zones (total storage) in short reaches of two small, sand-bed streams under free and obstructed flow conditions. Tracer curves were fit to the one-dimensional transport with inflow storage model OTIS-P. Networks of piezometers were used to measure specific discharge between the stream and the groundwater. In the sand-bed streams studied, parameters describing total retention were in the upper 50% of data compiled from the literature, most of which represented streams with beds coarser than sand. However, hyporheic storage was an insignificant component of total hydraulic retention, representing only 0.01-0-49% of total exchange, and this fraction did not increase after installation of flow obstructions. Total retention did not vary systematically with bed material size, but increased 50-100% following flow obstruction. Removal of roughness elements, such as large wood and debris dams, is detrimental to processes dependent upon transient storage in small, sand-bed streams.

23,"Zaramella, M",Jul 31 2003 ,Application of the transient storage model to analyze advective hyporheic exchange with deep and shallow sediment beds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydrodynamic exchange between a stream and its bed plays an important role in solute transport in rivers. Stream-subsurface exchange is known to occur due to several different mechanisms and different approaches have been used to model the resulting solute transport, but there has been little investigation of the ability of the various models to represent specific exchange processes. This work evaluates the ability of the semiempirical transient storage model (TSM) to represent advective hyporheic exchange driven by bed form-induced pore water flows. The TSM is based on the idealized hypothesis that the flux of contaminants is proportional to the difference in concentration between the bed and the stream. To evaluate the ability of this simplified mass transfer relationship to reproduce advective hyporheic exchange, we apply the TSM to data sets for the exchange of conservative solutes with sand beds in laboratory flumes where bed form-induced pumping is the dominant exchange mechanism. The results show that the simplified expressions used in the TSM can represent some but not all aspects of the pumping process. The TSM can represent advective exchange with shallow beds that have a defined exchange layer restricted by the presence of an impermeable boundary. In this case, transient storage parameters can be directly related to the streamflow conditions and the channel geometry. However, the TSM does not do a good job of representing exchange with a relatively deep sediment bed, where flow along different advective paths in the bed yields a wide distribution of exchange timescales.Show less"
24,"Roche, KR",Feb 2019 ,Modeling Benthic Versus Hyporheic Nutrient Uptake in Unshaded Streams With Varying Substrates,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Assessments of riverine ecosystem health and water quality require knowledge of how headwater streams transport and transform nutrients. Estimates of nutrient demand at the watershed scale are commonly inferred from reach-scale solute injections, which are typically reported as uptake velocities (v(f)). Multiple interacting processes control v(f), making it challenging to predict how v(f) responds to physical changes in the stream. In this study, we link v(f) to a continuous time random walk model to quantify how v(f) is controlled by in-stream (velocity, dispersion, and benthic reaction) and hyporheic processes (exchange rate, residence times, and hyporheic reaction). We fit the model to conservative (NaCl) and nitrate (NO3--N) pulse tracer injections in unshaded replicate streams at the Notre Dame Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility, which differed only in substrate size and distribution. Experiments were conducted over the first 25days of biofilm colonization to examine how the interaction between substrate type and biofilm growth influenced modeled processes and v(f). Model fits of benthic reaction rates were approximate to 8x greater than hyporheic reaction rates for all experiments and did not vary with substrate type or over time. High benthic reactivity was associated with filamentous green algae coverage on the streambed, which dominated total algal biomass. Finally, v(f) was most sensitive to benthic reaction rate and stream velocity, and sensitivity varied with stream conditions due to its nonlinear dependence on all modeled processes. Together, these results demonstrate how reach-scale nutrient demand reflects the relative contributions of biotic and abiotic processes in the benthic layer and the hyporheic zone.Show less"
25,"Kasahara, T",Oct 2007 ,Instream restoration: Its effects on lateral stream-subsurface water exchange in urban and agricultural streams in Southern Ontario,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Instream restoration strategies do not generally consider the subsurface environment. The study of recently restored stream reaches can provide an opportunity to assess the impacts of restoration on surface-subsurface exchange. In this study, lateral hyporheic zones occurring in a constructed gravel bar and re-meandered stream reach were examined, using hydrometric data in combination with differences in background conservative ion and tracer injection experiments. Both the constructed gravel bar and the meander bends induced lateral hyporheic exchange flow. In the gravel bar, lateral hyporheic exchange increased after a riffle-pool sequence was constructed in the channel adjacent to the bar. The substrate in the meander bends had low saturated hydraulic conductivity, and the stream-subsurface exchange was limited despite the large change in channel configuration. These results suggest that to enhance and maintain stream-subsurface water exchanges, restoration projects that modify horizontal geometry should involve construction of vertical morphologic features, and where floodplain sediments are fine-grained, the addition of coarse sediments should also be incorporated in the design.

26,"Wondzell, SM",Feb 15 2006 ,"Effect of morphology and discharge on hyporheic exchange flows in two small streams in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream-tracer injections were used to examine the effect of channel morphology and changing stream discharge on hyporheic exchange flows. Direct observations were made from well networks to follow tracer movement through the hyporheic zone. The reach-integrated influence of hyporheic exchange was evaluated using the transient storage model (TSM) OTIS-P. Transient storage modelling results were compared with direct observations to evaluate the reliability of the TSM. Results from the tracer injection in the bedrock reach supported the assumption that most transient storage in headwater mountain streams results from hyporheic exchange. Direct observations from the well networks in colluvial reaches showed that subsurface flow paths tended to parallel the valley axis. Cross-valley gradients were weak except near steps, where vertical and cross-valley hydraulic gradients indicated a strong potential for stream water to downwell into the hyporheic zone. The TSM parameters showed that both size and residence time of transient storage were greater in reaches with a few large log-jam-formed steps than in reaches with more frequent, but smaller steps. Direct observations showed that residence times in the unconstrained stream were longer than in the constrained stream and that little change occurred in the location and extent of the hyporheic zone between low- and high-baseflow discharges in any of the colluvial reaches. The transient storage modelling results did not agree with these observations, suggesting that the TSM was insensitive to long residence-time exchange flows and was very sensitive to changes in discharge. Disagreements between direct observations and the transient storage modelling results highlight fundamental problems with the TSM that confound comparisons between the transient storage modelling results for tracer injections conducted under differing flow conditions. Overall, the results showed that hyporheic exchange was little affected by stream discharge (at least over the range of baseflow discharges examined in this study). The results did show that channel morphology controlled development of the hyporheic zone in these steep mountain stream channels. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"

The objective of this study was to evaluate two important factors in the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the hyporheic zone: a considerable change in water flow conditions and various origins of riverbed sections, natural and artificial. To identify the spatial variation of the hydraulic gradient in the hyporheic zone of the river, a gradientmeter was applied. The measurements show that at low water stages, upwelling was dominant, with an evidently inactive zone, whereas downwelling was inconsiderable. However, the morphology of the riverbed changed during the flood flow, and downwelling clearly dominated. Upwelling zones retained their activity despite a major change in hydrological conditions. Present studies on the artificially dug Moszczenica Canal have documented outflow of water from an artificial medieval canal to a naturally formed drainage base. This means that despite the passage of hundreds of years, the natural drainage base of the Moszczenica River is still active. Studies have demonstrated the applicability of the gradientmeter for evaluating the interaction between surface and groundwaters in the hyporheic zone.Show less"
28,"Shrivastava, S",Feb 2021 ,Influence of Bioturbation on Hyporheic Exchange in Streams: Conceptual Model and Insights From Laboratory Experiments,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bioturbation occurs in streambeds by the action of a range of faunal species, but little is known about how it could modify the hyporheic exchange in streams. Previous experimental work investigating the effects of sediment-biota interaction on exchange across the sediment-water interface has been largely conducted in small mesocosms or infiltration columns that do not represent the lotic environment adequately. Therefore, the experimental findings from these studies may not be transferable to flowing water environments (e.g., streams). In this work, we first present a conceptual model demonstrating the causal pathways through which the sediment reworking and burrow ventilation processes (together referred to as bioturbation) could potentially modify the hyporheic flow regime. Next, to study the role of activities of faunal organisms in lotic environments and test some of the arguments presented in the model, laboratory experiments are conducted in re-circulating flumes. The experiments involved investigating the modification of dune-induced hyporheic flow due to the activities of a model bioturbating organism, Lumbriculus variegatus, following a control (without organisms) and treatment (with organisms) based experimental design. The sediment reworking activities such as surficial deposition of fecal pellets and burrowing by L. variegatus caused significantly higher hyporheic flux, longer mean residence times, and deeper solute penetration in the treatment flumes relative to the control flumes. We advocate that more intensive laboratory experiments and field investigations must be conducted to test the propositions put forward in the conceptual model and advance our understanding of the role of bioturbation process in fluvial ecosystems.Show less"
29,"Hall, RO",Jan 2020 ,Gas exchange in streams and rivers,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Gas exchange across the air-water boundary of streams and rivers is a globally large biogeochemical flux. Gas exchange depends on the solubility of the gas of interest, the gas concentrations of the air and water, and the gas exchange velocity (k), usually normalized to a Schmidt number of 600, referred to as k(600). Gas exchange velocity is of intense research interest because it is problematic to estimate, is highly spatially variable, and has high prediction error. Theory dictates that molecular diffusivity and turbulence drives variation in k(600) in flowing waters. We measure k(600) via several methods from direct measures, gas tracer experiments, to modeling of diel changes in dissolved gas concentrations. Many estimates of k(600) show that surface turbulence explains variation in k(600) leading to predictive models based upon geomorphic and hydraulic variables. These variables include stream channel slope and stream flow velocity, the product of which, is proportional to the energy dissipation rate in streams and rivers. These empirical models provide understanding of the controls on k(600), yet high residual variation in k(600) show that these simple models are insufficient for predicting individual locations. The most appropriate method to estimate gas exchange depends on the scientific question along with the characteristics of the study sites. We provide a decision tree for selecting the best method to estimate k(600) for individual river reaches to scaling to river networks.Show less"

TIFs can be used for remediation of acid mine drainage (AMD), however, as sediment depth increases, Fe(III)-reduction in anoxic subsurface areas may compromise treatment effectiveness. In this study we used near-surface electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) and in situ pore-water samplers to spatially resolve bulk conductivity changes within a TIF formed in a stream emanating from a large abandoned deep clay mine in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, USA. Because of the high fluid electrical conductivity of the emergent AMD (1860 mu S), fresh water (42 mu S) was added as a dilution tracer to visualize the spatial and temporal extent of hyporheic exchange and to characterize subsurface flow paths. Distinct hydrogeochemical niches were identified in the shallow subsurface beneath the stream by overlaying relative groundwater velocities (derived from ERI) with pore-water chemistry profiles. Niches were classified based on relatively ""fast"" versus ""slow"" rates of hyporheic exchange and oxic versus anoxic conditions. Pore-water concentrations and speciation of iron, pH, and redox potential differed between subsurface flow regimes. The greatest extent of hyporheic exchange was beneath the center of the stream, where a shallower (<10 cm) Fe(II)-oxidizing zone was observed. Meanwhile, less hyporheic exchange was observed near the channel banks, concurrent with a more pronounced, deeper (>70 cm) Fe(II)-oxidizing zone. At these locations, relatively slower groundwater exchange may promote biotic Fe(II)-oxidation and improve the long-term stability of Fe sequestered in TIFs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

31,"Liu, DS",Dec 2020 ,Hyporheic exchange mechanism driven by flood wave,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"To study the hyporheic exchange driven by a single peak flood-induced water level fluctuation (i.e., flood wave), a method combining numerical simulation with theoretical derivation was proposed based on the Inbuk Stream, Korea, where flooding occurs frequently. The hyporheic exchanges induced by different flood waves were investigated by varying amplitude (A), duration (T), wave type parameter (r), and rising duration (t(p)), which were adopted from the real-time stream stage fluctuations. Additionally, the idea of constant upstream flood volume (CUFV) condition for flood waves was put forward, and the effects of ""Botan"" (T/A) and peak number (N) on hyporheic exchange were studied. The results showed that the hyporheic exchange flux (q) was controlled by the water level h (sine-type) and its change rate v (cosine-type), and was proportional to the polynomial of them q proportional to (omega center dot h + v), where omega is the angular frequency of the flood wave. Based on this mechanism, the influence principles on hyporheic exchanges of the typical flood wave parameters (A, T, r and t(p)) as well as T/A and N under CUFV condition were clarified. The main characteristic variables of hyporheic exchange, which were maximum aquifer storage and residence time, were positively correlated. They also had positive relations to the integral of the flood wave over time, which increased when the wave became higher, wider, rounder and less skewed. However, when CUFV condition was imposed, the residence time was positively correlated with T/A, whereas the maximum aquifer storage was negatively correlated with T/A. With the increase in N, water exchanged more frequently and some water returned to the stream early, leading to the slight decrease in maximum aquifer storage and residence time. These findings enriched the theory of hyporheic exchange driven by surface water fluctuation and be of great significance to enhance pollutant degradation in the hyporheic zone downstream of reservoirs.Show less"

33,"Kaser, DH",May 2013 ,ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING CHANNEL MICROFORMS IN GROUNDWATER MODELS OF HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The infiltration of stream water in the sediment and its return to the streama process known here as hyporheic exchange flows (HEF)is a critical control of the structure and functions of the stream ecosystem. River restoration programmes will increasingly require quantitative methods for evaluating this influence. Previous studies have already shown the potential of numerical groundwater models to characterize HEF and compare restoration scenarios. Although various sources of uncertainty are acknowledged, the potential effect of small streambed structures (or microforms), such as grains or ripples, embedded in channel-unit scale structures (or macroforms), such as riffle-pool sequences, is commonly ignored. Here, a simple conceptualization through a 2-D vertical model is used to test whether (i) ignoring microforms in groundwater models at the macroform scale can impact estimations of residence times; (ii) microforms can influence HEF patterns driven by macroforms; and conversely (iii) the uncertainty of head measurements in stream piezometers can affect our understanding of HEF patterns. Results show that (i) residence times and flux estimations can be strongly affected by the modeller's choice to represent microform-induced HEF or not; (ii) the interaction of the microform and macroform scales can induce various subsurface flow patterns; and (iii) the perceived significance of microform-induced HEF is highly sensitive to the uncertainty of in-stream measurements of subsurface heads. Little is known about the relative efficiency of these microform and macroform scales, which are effectively influencing exchange at different depths and interacting with each other. Future studies that consider biogeochemical cycling or streambed ecology should be placed in this context. It is also necessary to find ways of including this source of uncertainty in groundwater models of HEF. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"

However, the impact of different metal pollution levels and hyporheic exchange on the microbial communities are still unclear. In this study, we further explored the effects of different degrees of heavy metals pollution and the strength of hyporheic exchange on the structures and functions of microbial community in hyporheic zone sediment ecosystem. Sediments were collected from the Weihe River to determine the concentrations of heavy metals, grain size distribution, and hydraulic conductivity, and the microbial information were obtained by eDNA technology. The comprehensive pollution status of the study area was at the slight and moderate level. The hydraulic conductivity (Kv) varied between 0.20 and 3.65 (m/d). The microbial community structures had complex temporal and spatial heterogeneity. The microbial molecular ecological network had modular characteristics and significant differences in different periods (p < 0.05). Metabolic functional genes in microbial communities had the highest relative abundance. In particular, there is a significant negative correlation between heavy metals and microorganisms (p < 0.05), with Cu and Zn contributing the most to microbial community changes (p < 0.05). Moreover, grain size had a significant impact on microorganisms, heavy metals and grain size significantly affect the predictive functions of microbial communities.

35,"Hester, ET",May 2018 ,Comparing reach scale hyporheic exchange and denitrification induced by instream restoration structures and natural streambed morphology,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Excess nutrients commonly lead to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. Stream restoration is increasingly popular for nutrient removal enhancing exchange with the reactive hyporheic zone. Hyporheic reactions such as denitrification are often transport-limited and instream restoration structures have been proposed to enhance hyporheic exchange and nutrient removal. However, the comparative effects of instream structure types and watershed setting (i.e. environmental characteristics such as sediment hydraulic conductivity, stream slope) are still poorly understood. Here we used MIKE SHE to model groundwater and surface water interaction and nitrate removal (denitrification) in a 200 m second order stream reach. We simulated various in-stream structures (channel-spanning weirs, partially spanning structures such as cross veins, buried structures) and investigated the effect of controlling environmental characteristics that vary with watershed setting. We found that the environmental characteristics had the greatest effect on surface water-groundwater exchange and therefore denitrification, including streambed hydraulic conductivity, natural or background stream topography and slope, and groundwater levels. Type and number of instream structures also influenced surface water-groundwater exchange and denitrification, but to a lesser degree. Human effects at the watershed scale from agriculture and urbanization likely play a role in whether reach-scale restoration practices succeed in achieving water quality goals both through effect on exchange itself (e.g., altering bed sediment texture) and on nitrate sources. More broadly, restoration efforts at the watershed scale itself, such as reducing fertilizer use or improving stormwater management, may be necessary to achieve ambitious water quality goals. Nevertheless, reach-scale restoration efforts such as in-stream structures may play a useful role in certain watershed settings, for example where groundwater conditions induce neither strong gaining nor strong losing conditions. The interaction of reachscale modifications and watershed setting must be understood to optimize nutrient removal from stream restoration through enhanced hyporheic exchange.Show less"
36,"Fox, A",Sep 2016 ,The effect of losing and gaining flow conditions on hyporheic exchange in heterogeneous streambeds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bed form-induced hyporheic exchange flux (q(H)) is increasingly viewed as a key process controlling water fluxes and biogeochemical processes in river networks. Despite the fact that streambeds are inherently heterogeneous, the majority of bed form flume-scale studies were done on homogeneous systems. We conducted salt and dye tracer experiments to study the effects of losing and gaining flow conditions on q(H) using a laboratory recirculating flume system packed with a heterogeneous streambed, and equipped with a drainage system that enabled us to apply losing or gaining fluxes. We found that when either losing or gaining fluxes increased (regardless of whether the flux was upward or downward), q(H) followed an exponential decline, the volume of the hyporheic flow cell drastically reduced, and the mean residence times declined moderately. A numerical flow model for the heterogeneous streambed was set up and fitted against the experimental data in order to test whether an equivalent homogeneous case exists. The measured q(H) were accurately predicted with the heterogeneous model, while it was underestimated using a homogeneous model characterized by the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity. It was also shown that in order to produce the results of the heterogeneous model with an equivalent hydraulic conductivity, the latter had to be increased as the losing or gaining fluxes increase. The results strongly suggest that it is critical to adequately account for the heterogeneous streambed structure in order to accurately predict the effect of vertical exchange fluxes between the stream and groundwater on hyporheic exchange.Show less"

Elevated salinities impact on aquatic biota and ecological processes of surface streams but little is known of the effects on the diversity and community composition of hyporheic (subsurface) invertebrates occupying the saturated sediments where surface and groundwaters exchange. We hypothesized that biodiversity of hyporheic invertebrates would decline with increasing salinity, especially where saline groundwater upwelled into the surface stream. We also predicted changes in community composition associated with salinity and direction of vertical hydrological exchange. Water and hyporheic invertebrates were sampled from downwelling and upwelling zones of 13 streams in southwestern Australia ranging in median surface water salinity from 0.27 to 17.86 g L-1. Overall, taxa richness of hyporheic invertebrates was uncorrelated with salinity but. surprisingly, correlated positively with the salinity of upwelling water. However, when the sites were divided into 'fresh' (<3 g L-1) and 'mesosaline' (<3 g L-1) groups, this relationship became non-significant. Instead, taxa richness and total abundance were correlated positively with salinity of downwelling water in fresh sites and negatively in mesosaline sites, resulting in a peak in richness at intermediate salinities. Community composition was unrelated to direction of hydrological exchange but was strongly associated with hyporheic salinity. Hyporheic assemblages of 'fresh' rivers were typified by harpacticoid copepods and candoniid ostracods, whereas the amphipod Austrochiltonia and several dipteran groups were more common below 'mesosaline' rivers. Although many hyporheic taxa collected in this study apparently have broad tolerances to salinity, secondary salinization due to human activities potentially changed community composition, possibly altering rates of ecological processes such as organic matter breakdown occurring within the sediments of streams undergoing salinization.

39,"Trauth, N",Apr 2015 ,Hydraulic controls of in-stream gravel bar hyporheic exchange and reactions,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange transports solutes into the subsurface where they can undergo biogeochemical transformations, affecting fluvial water quality and ecology. A three-dimensional numerical model of a natural in-stream gravel bar (20 m x 6 m) is presented. Multiple steady state streamflow is simulated with a computational fluid dynamics code that is sequentially coupled to a reactive transport groundwater model via the hydraulic head distribution at the streambed. Ambient groundwater flow is considered by scenarios of neutral, gaining, and losing conditions. The transformation of oxygen, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon by aerobic respiration and denitrification in the hyporheic zone are modeled, as is the denitrification of groundwater-borne nitrate when mixed with stream-sourced carbon. In contrast to fully submerged structures, hyporheic exchange flux decreases with increasing stream discharge, due to decreasing hydraulic head gradients across the partially submerged structure. Hyporheic residence time distributions are skewed in the log-space with medians of up to 8 h and shift to symmetric distributions with increasing level of submergence. Solute turnover is mainly controlled by residence times and the extent of the hyporheic exchange flow, which defines the potential reaction area. Although streamflow is the primary driver of hyporheic exchange, its impact on hyporheic exchange flux, residence times, and solute turnover is small, as these quantities exponentially decrease under losing and gaining conditions. Hence, highest reaction potential exists under neutral conditions, when the capacity for denitrification in the partially submerged structure can be orders of magnitude higher than in fully submerged structures.Show less"

We investigated how cobble clusters embedded in a finer-grained sand bed affect the near-bed channel flow and the exchange of surface and subsurface water. We tested how the spacing and embeddedness of cobbles altered hyporheic exchange through a three-dimensional fully coupled surface-subsurface model. The 3D modeling framework captured the full physics of the exchange process locating the lateral position of upwelling zones on the side of the cobble. As the cobbles protrude more into the channel, eddies appear downstream, with smaller vortices where cobbles are closer together. In our simulations, hyporheic exchange increased with the spacing and protrusion ratio. The travel time in the hyporheic zone also increased with the protrusion ratio because the hyporheic flow paths are longer when the cobble is more protruded. With different spacings at the highest protrusion ratio, the average slope of early time breakthrough curve was steeper for large spacing settings: the travel time increases as the spacing decreases.Show less"
41,"Cook, S",Dec 20 2020 ,Bedform characteristics and biofilm community development interact to modify hyporheic exchange,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The physical and biological attributes of riverine ecosystems interact in a complex manner which can affect the hydrodynamic behaviour of the system. This can alter the mixing characteristics of a river at the sediment-water interface. Research on hyporheic exchange has increased in recent years driven by a greater appreciation for the importance of this dynamic ecotone in connecting and regulating river systems. An understanding of process-based interactions driving hyporheic exchange is still limited, specifically the feedbacks between the physical and biological controlling factors. The interplay between bed morphology and sediment size on biofilm community development and the impact on hyporheic exchange mechanisms, was experimentally considered. Purpose built recirculating flume systems were constructed and three profiles of bedform investigated: i) flat, ii) undulating lambda = 1 m, ii) undulating lambda = 0.2 m, across two different sized sediments (0.5 mm and 5 mm). The influence of biofilm growth and bedform interaction on hyporheic exchange was explored, over time, using discrete repeat injections of fluorescent dye into the flumes. Hyporheic exchange rates were greatest in systems with larger sediment sizes (5 mm) and with more bedforms (undulating lambda = 0.2). Sediment size was a dominant control in governing biofilm growth and hyporheic exchange in systems with limited bedform. In systems where bedform was prevalent, sediment size and biofilm appeared to no longer be a control on exchange clue to the physical influence of advective pumping. Here, exchange rates within these environments were more consistent overtime, despite greater microbial growth. As such, bedform has the potential to overcome the rate limiting effects of biotic factors on hyporheic exchange and sediment size on microbial penetration. This has implications for pollutant and nutrient penetration; bedforms increase hydrological connectivity, generating the opportunity to support microbial communities at depth and as such, improve the self-purification ability of river systems.

We used in-stream mini-piezometers and heat transport modelling of stream and streambed temperatures to quantify the rates and directions of water flux across the streambed interface upstream and downstream of three types of in-stream geomorphic features: a permanent dam, a beaver dam remnant and a stream meander. We derived hyporheic flux estimates at three different depths at six different sites for a month and then paired those flux rates with measurements of gradient to derive hydraulic conductivity (K) of the streambed sediments. Heat transport modelling provided consistent daily flux estimates that were in agreement directionally with hydraulic gradient measurements and also identified vertical heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity that led to variable hyporheic exchange. Streambed K varied over an order of magnitude (1.9 x 10(-6) to 5.7 d 10(-5) m/s). Average rates of hyporheic flux ranged from static (q < +/- 0.02 m/day) to 0.42 m/day.

44,"Yuan, Y",Jun 2021 ,Hyporheic Exchange Driven by Submerged Rigid Vegetation: A Modeling Study,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Flow-vegetation interaction affects fluid flow hydraulics and associated material transport in river corridors. Concomitant changes in pressure within the flow field due to the presence of vegetation may act as a driver for the formation of hyporheic flow across the sediment-water interface. This potentially important process, however, has yet to be studied. In order to investigate vegetation-induced hyporheic exchange, a series of numerical models of interlinked surface-subsurface flow modified by plant stems was conducted. Periodically staggered plant stem arrays on a flat sediment bed were considered within a coupled multiphysics computational fluid dynamics approach. Plants were idealized as rigid cylinders and arranged in different streamwise and spanwise spacing distances. Each vegetation array was then subjected to a broad range of flow Reynolds Numbers (Re). The results showed that hyporheic flow occurs in all conditions with the presence of vegetation. The vegetation-induced hyporheic flux is found to be a function of Re via a power law. The flux increases with interstem space until the space reaches the distance that rigid stems no longer affect the flow structures in the vicinity of each other. Larger intervegetation distances lead to a larger hyporheic zone. A direct comparison with bedform-induced hyporheic flow showed that vegetation can induce higher hyporheic flux through relatively shallower exchange zones. The results of all the simulations were synthesized into predictive models for hyporheic flux, bulk residence time and exchange depth based on drag coefficient, vegetation density, and Reynolds Number.Show less"
45,"Roche, KR",May 2019 ,Effects of Turbulent Hyporheic Mixing on Reach-Scale Transport,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Turbulence causes rapid mixing of solutes and fine particles between open channel flow and coarse-grained streambeds. Turbulent mixing is known to control hyporheic exchange fluxes and the distribution of vertical mixing rates in the streambed, but it is unclear how turbulent mixing ultimately influences mass transport at the reach scale. We used a particle-tracking model to simulate local- and reach-scale solute transport for a stream with coarse-grained sediments. Simulations were first used to determine profiles of vertical mixing rates that best described solute concentration profiles measured within a coarse granular bed in flume experiments. These vertical mixing profiles were then used to simulate a pulse solute injection to show the effects of turbulent hyporheic exchange on reach-scale solute transport. Experimentally measured concentrations were best described by simulations with a nonmonotonic mixing profile, with highest mixing at the sediment-water interface and exponential decay into the bed. Reach-scale simulations show that this enhanced interfacial mixing couples in-stream and hyporheic solute transport. Coupling produces an interval of exponential decay in breakthrough curves and delays the onset of power law tailing. High streamwise velocities in the hyporheic zone reduce mass recovery in the water column and cause breakthrough curves to exhibit steeper power law slopes than predictions from mobile-immobile modeling theory. These results demonstrate that transport models must consider the spatial variability of streamwise velocity and vertical mixing for both the stream and the hyporheic zone, and new analytical theory is needed to describe reach-scale transport when high streamwise velocities are present in the hyporheic zone.Show less"
46,"Edwardson, KJ",Sep 2003 ,"The hydraulic characteristics and geochemistry of hyporheic and parafluvial zones in Arctic tundra streams, north slope, Alaska",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Sodium bromide and Rhodamine WT were used as conservative tracers to examine the hydrologic characteristics of seven tundra streams in Arctic Alaska, during the summers of 1994-1996. Continuous tracer additions were conducted in seven rivers ranging from 1st to 5th order with samples collected from instream, hyporheic, and parafluvial locations. Tracer data was used as input for a computer model to estimate hydrologic characteristics of each study reach. While solute concentrations during the tracer additions indicated that steady-state or ""plateau"" conditions had been reached, interstitial samples indicated that there were additional hyporheic and parafluvial zones that had not been fully labeled at the time of apparent steady state in the stream channel (plateau). Exchange between channel and hyporheic water was a function of location within a pool-riffle sequence, with rapid downwelling at the head of riffles and delayed upwelling in riffle tails. The extent of exchange between channel and hyporheic water was positively correlated with apparent streambed hydraulic conductivity. Tracer additions indicated interstitial velocities ranging from 0.030 to 0.075 cm s(-1) and hydraulic conductivities from 2.4 to 12.2 cm s(-1). Hyporheic and in-channel samples were collected for N, P, DO, and CO2 analyses in conjunction with conservative tracer additions in four of the stream reaches for which the interstitial velocities were also determined. Transformation rates based on these data indicated that there was rapid nitrification of mineralized organic N and production of ammonium, phosphate, and carbon dioxide in the interstitial zones of all four reaches. Dissolved oxygen did not appear to be limiting in the reaches studied. The hyporheic zone of all four reaches was a source of nitrate, carbon dioxide, and ammonium to the channel water based on the average concentration of upwelling waters. Increased contact time with hyporheic and parafluvial zones was related to decreased temperature and increased conductivity. Net nitrogen flux from the hyporheic zone was equivalent to 14-162% of benthic N uptake requirements for the Kuparuk River. These observations are important because we expected that the presence of continuous permafrost in this Arctic environment would limit the importance of hyporheic processes, either physically (i.e., through the presence of a restricting thaw bulb in the permafrost) or biogeochemically (i.e., through low temperatures). Instead, we found that biogeochernical processes in the hyporheic zone of these Arctic streams are at least as important as it is in similar temperate stream ecosystems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

47,"Marzadri, A",Apr 2013 ,Effects of stream morphodynamics on hyporheic zone thermal regime,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We develop a heat-transport model to study the impact of streambed morphology on temperature distribution within the hyporheic zone of gravel bed rivers. The heat transport model, which includes conduction, diffusion, and advection, is solved by a Lagrangian approach, neglecting transverse dispersion and considering stream water temperature as boundary condition at the streambed. First, we show that the model accurately reproduces the temperature distribution measured within the hyporheic zone of a reach of the Bear Valley Creek, Idaho (USA). Our model reveals spatially complex patterns of hyporheic water temperatures that vary with time within the hyporheic zone and at the streambed surface. The analysis shows that temperature distributions are primarily related to the hyporheic residence time and consequently to the bed morphology and in-stream flow discharge. Results show that the hyporheic temperature amplitudes are smaller than the surface water temperature and they decrease with stream size, leading hyporheic zones of large streams to be independent from in-stream daily temperature fluctuations.Show less"
48,"Dudunake, T",Oct 2020 ,Local and Reach-Scale Hyporheic Flow Response From Boulder-Induced Geomorphic Changes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream hydromorphology regulates in-stream water flow and interstitial flow of water within streambed sediments, the latter known as hyporheic exchange. Whereas hyporheic flow has been studied in sand-bedded streams with ripples and dunes and in gravel-bedded streams with pool-riffle morphology, little is known about its characteristics in plane bed morphology with subdued streambed undulations and sparse macroroughness elements such as boulders and cobbles. Here, we present a proof-of-concept investigation on the role of boulder-induced morphological changes on hyporheic flows based on coupling large-scale flume sediment transport experiments with computational fluid dynamics. Our results show that placement of boulders on plane beds increase the reach-scale hyporheic median residence time, tau(50), by 15% and downwelling flux, q(d), by 18% from the plane bed. However, reach-scale hyporheic exchange changes are stronger with tau(50) decreasing by 20% and q(d) increasing by 79% once the streambed morphology reached equilibrium (with the imposed upstream sediment and flow inputs on boulders). These results suggest that hyporheic flow is sensitive to the geomorphic response from bed topography and sediment transport in gravel-bedded streams, a process that has been overlooked in previous work.Show less"
49,"Cardenas, MB",Aug 18 2004 ,"Impact of heterogeneity, bed forms, and stream curvature on subchannel hyporheic exchange",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Advection through hyporheic zones (HZ) consisting of heterogeneous channel bend streambed deposits and their equivalent homogenous medium was investigated using finite difference groundwater flow and transport simulations and forward particle tracking. The top prescribed head boundary was varied in order to mimic various stream channel head distributions resulting from the presence of bed forms and channel curvature. Flux calculations show that heterogeneity causes significant additional HZ flux compared to an equivalent homogenous medium. However, the major cause of HZ flux is a spatially periodic ( sinusoidal) head distribution along the boundary, representing the effect of bed forms. The additional influence of heterogeneity on the total channel-bed exchange and the overall HZ geometry are increased when boundary head sinusoidal fluctuation is more subdued. We present dimensionless numbers that summarize these relationships. Heterogeneity's influence is further magnified by considering the effect of channel curvature on boundary heads. The simulations illustrate the dynamic influence of heterogeneity on the hyporheic zone since the various head boundaries employed in our modeling efforts are a proxy for different surface water conditions and bed form states that may occur during a single flood. Furthermore, we show that residence times ( total tracking times) of particles originating from the streambed follow a lognormal distribution. In the presence of heterogeneity, residence times can decrease or they can increase compared to residence times for homogeneous conditions depending on the relative positions of the heterogeneities and the bed forms. Hence streambed heterogeneity and stream curvature, factors often neglected in previous modeling efforts, combine with bed form configuration to dynamically determine HZ geometry, fluxes, and residence time distributions.Show less"
