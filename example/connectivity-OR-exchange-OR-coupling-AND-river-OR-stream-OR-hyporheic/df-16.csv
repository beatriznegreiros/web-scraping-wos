0,"Wohl, E",Jan 15 2014 ,Leaky rivers: Implications of the loss of longitudinal fluvial disconnectivity in headwater streams,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Naturally induced longitudinal disconnectivity in the form of channel-spanning logjams creates backwaters along headwater streams that reduce velocity and transport capacity, create at least temporary storage sites for finer sediment and organic matter, and enhance biological processing and uptake of nutrients. Land uses that reduce wood recruitment and instream storage result in reduced stream complexity and increased longitudinal connectivity in headwater rivers. We examine three scales of naturally occurring longitudinal disconnectivity in headwater streams of the Colorado Front Range and the implications for channel process and form of historical alterations in disconnectivity. Basin-scale disconnectivity at channel lengths of 10(2)-10(3) m results from downstream alternations between steep, narrowly confined valley segments with single-thread channels, and lower gradient, wider, valley segments with multi-thread channels. This variation in valley geometry likely reflects differences in average spacing between joints in bedrock outcrops, which influences bedrock weathering and erosion. Greater volumes of wood stored in the wide valley segments correlate with more closely spaced channel-spanning logjams and greater storage of fine sediments and organic matter. Reach-scale disconnectivity at channel lengths of 10(1)-10(2) m results from the presence of numerous, closely spaced channel-spanning logjams, which cumulatively store substantial amounts of fine sediment and organic matter. The backwater effects associated with an individual jam can result in the accumulation of up to similar to 11 m(3) of fine sediment upstream from the jam, of which as much as 21% is organic matter. Unit-scale disconnectivity at channel lengths of 10(0)-10(1) m results from the presence of an individual channel-spanning logjam, which locally alters bed gradient, substrate composition, bedform dimensions, and the transport of sediment and organic matter. The transport and storage of instream wood is a critical component of disconnectivity at all spatial scales examined. Land uses such as timber harvest, flow regulation, and placer mining that result in reduced wood recruitment or removal of instream wood appear to create an alternative stable state in which channels are unable to retain wood because of reduced debris roughness. The net effect of reduced longitudinal disconnectivity is increased transport of fine sediment and organic matter and reduced biological uptake of nutrients. The altered headwater streams become leaky with respect to fine sediments and nutrients. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"

Nevertheless, much more may be obtained from this innovative quantification of changes. In this paper, we enhance the interpretation of geomorphic processes by presenting a new method for understanding of sources and sinks of sediment, river sediment transfers and functional sediment connectivity. Repeat digital elevation models (DEMs) obtained by photogrammetry were used to quantify topographic change after two floods by creating a DEM of difference (DoD) of a 6.5 km-long reach of Rambla de la Viuda stream, an ephemeral gravel-bed river in eastern Spain. The proposed method involved dividing the channel into 10 m-long longitudinal strips that were used to systematically draw boundaries between the erosional and depositional areas of the DoD. The analysis objectively: (i) drew a series of erosional and depositional segments, from 120 to 1360 m in length; (ii) estimated ranges of source-to-storage sediment transport distances, 320-670 m in the upstream and middle reaches and up to 2030 m in the lower reach; and (iii) obtained values of functional connectivity (i.e. the ratio between the sediment exported (erosion) and retained (deposition), ranging from 10(3) to 10(-3)). The variability in these three parameters along the river was found to be related to the level of channel disturbance by in-stream mining during the 1990s and 2000s. Additionally, this method indicates that the main process responsible for self-adjustment of the present morphosedimentary conditions is intra-reach erosion of banks and channel beds. Thus, this study proposes a new methodology to characterize morphological change, sediment transfer and connectivity that may serve as environmental indicators of the hydromorphological integrity of rivers with potential application to the European Water Framework Directive.

3,"Jones, J",Jul 10 2019 ,A comprehensive assessment of stream fragmentation in Great Britain,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Artificial barriers are one of the main threats to river ecosystems, resulting in habitat fragmentation and loss of connectivity. Yet, the abundance and distribution of most artificial barriers, excluding high-head dams, is poorly documented. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the distribution and typology of artificial barriers in Great Britain, and estimate for the first time the extent of river fragmentation. To this end, barrier data were compiled from existing databases and were ground-truthed by field surveys in England, Scotland and Wales to derive a correction factor for barrier density across Great Britain. Field surveys indicate that existing barrier databases underestimate barrier density by 68%, particularly in the case of low-head structures (<1 m) which are often missing from current records. Field-corrected barrier density estimates ranged from OAS barriers/km in Scotland to 0.63 barriers/km in Wales, and 075 banters/km in England. Corresponding estimates of stream fragmentation by weirs and dams only, measured as mean barrier-free length, were 12.30 km in Scotland, 6.68 km in Wales and 529 km in England, suggesting the extent of river modification differs between regions. Our study indicates that 97% of the river network in Great Britain is fragmented and <1% of the catchments are free of artificial barriers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
4,"Zhang, YP",Apr 15 2006 ,An experimental investigation of streaming potentials through homogeneous ion-exchange membranes,DESALINATION,"Streaming potentials through homogeneous ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) were studied with several anion-exchange membranes prepared in our laboratory. Discussions are mainly concentrated on the effects of the chemistry, concentration and pH of the outer solution as well as the thickness and ion-exchange capacity of the IEMs. Results show that except for the membrane thickness hardly affecting the streaming potential coefficient, the remaining factors influence it more or less. The difference of the streaming potential coefficient for different electrolyte solutions with equal concentrations is due to different mobilities of the cations or anions of those electrolytes; the pH of outer solution only alters the magnitude of the streaming potential coefficient, but has no influence on its sign; and the streaming potential coefficient increases with increasing IEC and with decreasing concentration of the outer solution. The desalination rate of the IEMs can be also roughly estimated by the difference of the electrical potential in two opposite pressure directions including the pressure-increase direction (+) and the pressure-reduced direction (-).Show less"
5,"Rodeles, AA",Oct 2020 ,A new method to include fish biodiversity in river connectivity indices with applications in dam impact assessments,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Different indices have been developed to quantify the extent and severity of river fragmentation. These indices vary depending on the specific goals of the study. Here, we present a new Conservation Connectivity Index (CCIP) for potamodromous fish species that considers the conservation value (richness, rarity and vulnerability) of river segments. The Iberian Peninsula holds > 20 endemic and endangered potamodromous fish species as well as > 1000 large dams (> 1 hm(3) of capacity). The CCIP was calculated for the eight most important river basins of the Iberian Peninsula and compared to the Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCIP) developed by Cote et al. in 2009, which uses only river length as a habitat variable. With the use of both DCIP and CCIP, the dams were analysed and ranked according to their impacts on the river basin. The main results show that Iberian river basins are heavily fragmented, with river basin connectivity percentages of less than 20% in most cases using both DCIP and CCIP. CCIP values are slightly higher than DCIP values in almost all cases. When the impact of individual dams is analysed, differences also appear between the DCIP and CCIP. CCIP highlights the impact of dams located in areas of high fish conservation value while DCIP emphasize the impact of dams fragmenting large river segments. The CCIP appears to be adequate to highlight important sites for conservation in river connectivity studies. It could be applied in different studies and river basins around the world to prioritize dam removals or plan new dam locations.Show less"
6,"Ingendahl, D",Aug 2002 ,Linking hyporheic community respiration and inorganic nitrogen transformations in the River Lahn (Germany),ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Hyporheic community respiration was measured in a riffle-pool-riffle sequence located up- and downstream from a wastewater treatment plant of the River Lahn, Germany. Sediment filled tubes were incubated for several months in the hyporheic zone and then transferred to the laboratory where the oxygen consumption by the hyporheic community colonizing the tubes was measured in a recirculating system. Oxygen consumption in 64 tubes from four sites averaged 0.69 mg O-2 dm(-3) h(-1) with surface water from upstream of the wastewater treatment plant. After the successive amendment of nitrite and ammonium, community respiration increased to 1.14 and 1.36 mg O-2 dm(-3) h(-1), respectively. Nitrate production during the experiments increased from 0.024 mg NO3-N dm(-3) h(-1) to 0.219 and 0.220 mg NO3-N dm(-3) h(-1) with the amendment of nitrite and ammonium, respectively, indicating nitrogen limitation in the hyporheic zone. Respiration and nitrate production correlated strongly with the amount of organic matter accumulated in the tubes during the several months of sediment incubation. Significantly higher respiration and nitrate production after amendment of ammonium were observed for the two sites located downstream of the wastewater treatment plant effluent in comparison to those upstream of the WWTP. This increase indicates a possible impact of wastewater supply to rivers, especially on the hyporheic zone where an important part of organic matter break-down and nutrient recycling occurs in mesotrophic rivers.Show less"
7,"Moren, I",Nov 2017 ,Design of Remediation Actions for Nutrient Mitigation in the Hyporheic Zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Although hyporheic exchange has been shown to be of great importance for the overall water quality of streams, it is rarely considered quantitatively in stream remediation projects. A main driver of hyporheic exchange is the hydraulic head fluctuation along the streambed, which can be enhanced by modifications of the streambed topography. Here we present an analytical 2-D spectral subsurface flow model to estimate the hyporheic exchange associated with streambed topographies over a wide range of spatial scales; a model that was validated using tracer-test-results and measurements of hydraulic conductivity. Specifically, engineered steps in the stream were shown to induce a larger hyporheic exchange velocity and shorter hyporheic residence times compared to the observed topography in Tullstorps Brook, Sweden. Hyporheic properties were used to parameterize a longitudinal transport model that accounted for reactions in terms of first-order decay and instantaneous adsorption. Theoretical analyses of the mitigation effect for nitrate due to denitrification in the hyporheic zone show that there is a Damkohler number of the hyporheic zone, associated with several different stream geomorphologies, that optimizes nitrate mass removal on stream reach scale. This optimum can be limited by the available hydraulic head gradient given by the slope of the stream and the geological constraints of the streambed. The model illustrates the complex interactions between design strategies for nutrient mitigation, hyporheic flow patterns, and stream biogeochemistry and highlights the importance to diagnose a stream prior remediation, specifically to evaluate if remediation targets are transport or reaction controlled.Show less"
8,"Deng, XJ",Aug 2018 ,Impacts of human activities on the structural and functional connectivity of a river network in the Taihu Plain,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,"Human activities are expected to change the hydrological connectivity of river networks. Understanding the impacts of human activities on hydrological connectivity is crucial for river-basin management. The present study investigated the impacts of river network change and water gate construction on the structural and functional connectivity in the Taihu Plain. We found that the network circuitry, edge-node ratio, and network connectivity of the arterial river network increased by 8.82%, 3.59%, and 3.57%, respectively, during the 1960s-2010s. In Jiangyin, the indexes decreased by 46.40%, 15.43%, and 15.42%, respectively, throughout the river network during the 1960s-1980s. The indexes of the capillary river network decreased by 61.90%, 24.89%, and 24.88%, respectively, while those of the arterial river network increased by 6.58%, 4.73%, and 2.72%, respectively. We also found that the current longitudinal continuity of the river network was 8.15. In the Sangan River of Zhangjiagang, the migratory continuity of the river network was 0.27, but it was between 0.33 and 1.00 when the current water gates were considered separately, and the decreases of their maximum values under different combinations were greater than those of their minimum values. Moreover, we found that the various water levels of the river network all exhibited increasing trends, and their correlations with functional connectivity were significant and positive. Our study suggests that the negative effects of river network changes on structural connectivity were far greater than the positive effects, and the impacts of water gate construction on functional connectivity had gradient and cumulative effects.Show less"
9,"Navel, S",2012 ,A modelling approach to quantify the influence of fine sediment deposition on biogeochemical processes occurring in the hyporheic zone,ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"Excessive sedimentation of fine particles on stream beds has been recognized as a major threat to running-water ecosystems. Deposition of fine sediments often affects hyporheic zone (HZ) functioning by (1) reducing hydrological exchanges at the water-sediment interface and by (2) increasing the organic matter (OM) content of surface sediments. These two factors usually occur concurrently to control biogeochemical processes in sediments. In the present study, experimental and modelling approaches were coupled to evaluate the contribution of these factors on the biogeochemical functioning of the HZ. We used a one-dimensional (1D) vertical model taking into account the hydrodynamic properties, the vertical distribution of the OM and the main microbial processes involved in OM processing (aerobic respiration, denitrification, nitrification and sulphate reduction). This Mobile-Immobile Model for Organic Matter (MIM-OM) model was calibrated and validated using experimental data (conservative tracer, dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations) obtained in filtration columns filled with a porous sedimentary matrix. Simulations showed that organic carbon content and Darcy velocity acted in concert to shape biogeochemical processes in stream sediments. The use of the MIM-OM model on data obtained in filtration columns impacted by fine sediment deposition indicated that the biodegradability of the OM (modified through the degradation parameter k(POC)) also played a key role on biogeochemical processes occurring in sediments. In conclusion, the MIM-OM model appears as an efficient simulation tool to evaluate biogeochemical functioning in river sediments under different conditions (granulometry, quality of surface water and clogging).Show less"
10,"Baratelli, F",Nov 2016 ,"Estimation of stream-aquifer exchanges at regional scale using a distributed model: Sensitivity to in-stream water level fluctuations, riverbed elevation and roughness",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Several studies on stream-aquifer interactions focus on the local scale. However, the estimation of stream-aquifer exchanges for a regional river network remains challenging. This study aims at assessing the sensitivity of distributed stream-aquifer exchanges to in-stream water level fluctuations, riverbed elevation and Manning roughness coefficient.An integrated distributed surface-subsurface model is applied to the Loire river basin (117,480 km(2), France), where in-stream water level fluctuations are taken into account with a simplified Manning-Strickler approach. The stream-aquifer exchanges are analyzed at pluri-annual and annual scales, as well as during short-term hydrological events.The model simulates the spatio-temporal variability of in-stream water levels accurately, with Nash coefficients up to 0.96 for the Loire river. The river network mainly drains the aquifer system. The average net exchanged flow is 2.10(-2) m(3) s(-1) km(-1), which corresponds to 12% of the averaged discharge at the outlet of the basin.The assumption of constant river stages significantly impacts the total infiltration (-70%) and exfiltration (-10%) in the basin, whereas it has a negligible influence on the average net flux. The river fluctuations increase the time variability of the stream-aquifer exchanges and may determine flow reversals during flood events and also more frequently for river stretches at equilibrium with its nearby aquifer.This study highlights the importance of accounting for river stage fluctuations in the modeling of regional hydrosystems. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis indicates that it is mandatory to develop new methodologies to better estimate the riverbed elevation at high resolution for a river network at regional scale. In a lesser extent, errors on Manning coefficient affect the timing of infiltration and exfiltration, leading to temporally localized discrepancies. However it does not affect the estimates of the global net exchanges significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
11,"Laube, G",Dec 2018 ,The systematic effect of streambed conductivity heterogeneity on hyporheic flux and residence time,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"A systematic understanding of hyporheic flux (HF) and residence times (RT) is important as they are a major control of biogeochemical processing in streambeds. Previous studies addressing the effect of heterogeneity in streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) on HF and RT have come to deviating conclusions depending on the specific study design and the selection of heterogeneity cases being investigated. To more systematically evaluate the effects of conductivity heterogeneity on HF and RT, we simulated hyporheic exchange induced by idealized streambed ripples over a large range of heterogeneities. Conductivity heterogeneity was represented in the simulations in terms of 10,000 different heterogeneity realizations from a geostatistical model based on continuous Gaussian and discrete indicator random fields. We demonstrate that any isotropic homogeneous K-field, as an average of a heterogeneous K-field, can only match RT or HF of the respective heterogeneous K-field, but never both. We found exponential correlations of RT and HF with the variance of heterogeneous conductivity. Based on these correlations, an equivalent anisotropic homogeneous conductivity tensor K can be derived. This equivalent anisotropic K efficiently accounts for the effects of small scale heterogeneity on HF and RT. It can be calculated from the median and variance of the hydraulic conductivity distribution of the targeted heterogeneous sediment, without explicitly characterizing the sediment texture.Show less"
12,"Grodzka-Lukaszewska, M",2021 ,Spatial distribution of the water exchange through river cross-section - measurements and the numerical model,ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,"The aspects of surface stability and groundwater exchange recognized by many researchers due to the intensification of agriculture and industry (manifested in, e.g., regulation and dredging of riverbed sediments of rivers) are now widely discussed on the international forum of water policy and management. It is essential to assess the spatial variability of water exchange through the river length and cross sections for the preparation of data and calculation of the groundwater flow model. This article presents research which describes the spatial distribution of the surface water-groundwater interaction within the river cross-section. Two measurement series were carried out to describe its variability. Additionally, a groundwater flow model was developed to simulate and represent the variable nature of water exchange in the hyporheic zone in the river's cross-section. The model was successfully verified by means of measurements of water flux in the hyporheic zone. The precise spatial description of this variability is the first step to determine the possibility of introducing this variable in an accurate manner, within the limits of measurement uncertainties or simulation assumptions, in the construction of mathematical models of groundwater flow.Show less"
13,"Jing, YR",Jun 20 2022 ,Effects of road and river networks on sediment connectivity in mountainous watersheds,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Road and river networks in mountainous watersheds play an important role in transporting eroded sediments. However, the underlying transport mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly in terms of how alterations to flow paths caused by road and river networks influence sediment connectivity. Therefore, using data from the Dongshuanghe (DSH) watershed in the Dabie Mountain in Central China, this study investigated the spatial relationships between road and river networks, analyzed the effects of road and river networks on the spatial distribution of sediment connectivity, and determined the primary factors influencing sediment connectivity. The primary factors were identified using the index of connectivity (IC), buffer analysis, a random forest (RF) model, and a geographical detector model (GDM). The results indicated that road and river networks were spatially closely associated: closer to rivers, the density of high-grade roads increased, while farther from road-river crossings, the length and density of rivers and high-grade roads decreased. Both road and river networks affected the IC. In particular, for permanent drainage lines or local sinks, the average value of ICR (i.e., IC affected by road networks, -0.97) was higher than that of IC (-2.17). Thus, values of ICR decreased substantially with increasing distance to the closest roads (R2 = 0.73). However, beyond a threshold of 150 m, the effect of roads on ICR gradually diminished. In addition, the structural characteristics of road networks, particularly slope (Road_S), had greater explanatory power for spatial variation in the ICR. In conclusion, compared to the river networks, the effect of road networks on ICR was more important, which was not only reflected in the spatial distribution of ICR, but also in the factors influencing ICR.Show less"
14,"Brooks, AC",May 2022 ,"Evaluating Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of River-Floodplain Surface Water Connectivity Using Hydrometric, Geochemical and Microbial Indicators",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Water-mediated linkages that connect landscape components are collectively referred to as hydrologic connectivity. In river-floodplain systems, quantifying hydrologic connectivity is challenging yet enables descriptions of hydrologic function that emerge from complex, heterogeneous interactions of underlying geomorphic, climatic and biologic controls. Here, we quantify surface water hydrologic connectivity using field indicators and develop a connectivity strength metric across a river-floodplain system. To measure connectivity strength, we analyzed hydrometric data, conservative tracers, and natural occurring geochemical and microbial tracers across streamflows. We developed empirical models of hydrologic connectivity and predicted daily connectivity strength values across sites and assessed the sensitivity of connectivity to streamflow variability. Some floodplain areas were consistently connected or disconnected to the river, while other floodplain areas exhibited variable connectivity strength through the season. Of the locations with intermittent connectivity, some disconnected quickly and others had a prolonged disconnection phase. At the river-floodplain system scale, we found hydrologic connectivity always increased with streamflow while across-system variance in connectivity peaked at intermediate streamflow. Floodplain locations with intermittent surface connectivity demonstrated inter-annual variability in hydrologic connectivity as a function of climate variability. Our results suggest that intermediate flows are critical periods for seasonal connectivity regimes and understanding the influence of changing climate on full flow durations will be required to predict impacts on river-floodplain connectivity.Show less"
15,"Korkmaz, S",Mar 15 2009 ,Application of the coupled model to the Somme river basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrological modeling of the Somme river basin situated in the north of France was made with special emphasis on the stream-aquifer interaction. Due to immense groundwater storage in the chalk aquifer, a damaging flood took place in the basin in spring 2001. To best represent the phenomena occurring in the basin, the coupled model also known as MODCOU was selected to be applied to this particular basin. The whole model structure consists of several components, namely, surface model, groundwater model, unsaturated zone model, and the coupled model. In order to run the surface model, meteorological forcing, land use, and soil type data were acquired. By using land use and soil type data, production zones were obtained. The surface model partitions the precipitation between surface runoff, infiltration, and actual evapotranspiration according to the parameters of production zones. The unsaturated zone model computes the recharge of groundwater by using infiltration from the surface using a Nash cascade model. By using the groundwater model, a steady-state piezometric head distribution is obtained to serve as an initial condition to the coupled model. The unsteady groundwater and surface flow simulations are carried out by the coupled model. Initially, spatial information on the basin was extracted by using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) analysis. After acquiring the necessary spatial data, the surface and aquifer grids were generated by using nested grid generators which make refinement on the stream network and sub-catchment boundaries in order to increase the accuracy of numerical solution. A very detailed calibration was performed by following a step-by-step procedure in which the best fit in flow and piezometric head hydrographs was sought. In the surface model, concentration time and parameters of production zones are calibrated. For coupled surface-groundwater flows transmissivity, specific yield and discharge coefficient; and for flow in unsaturated zone storage constant were calibrated. During the simulations, intense and interrupted exfiltrations were observed over the basin. Two algorithms were developed in order to correct the issue caused by the coarse resolution of the DEM: (1) a 'fill' algorithm was used to remove the sinks and obtain a smoother surface; and (2) a correction procedure for river cell elevations is proposed to acquire continuous exfiltration along the stream network. Validation of the model was made using the discharges at two points on the Somme, namely, Hangest-Sur-Somme and Peronne, which had not been used in any stage of the modeling process and satisfactory results were obtained. The groundwater behavior, its effect on the surface flow and the flood of 2001 are satisfactorily represented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
16,"Wu, LW",Dec 2018 ,Impact of Dynamically Changing Discharge on Hyporheic Exchange Processes Under Gaining and Losing Groundwater Conditions,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Channel discharge, geomorphological setting, and regional groundwater flow determine the spatiotemporal variability of bedform-induced hyporheic exchange and the emergence of biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments that it drives. Of particular interest, and significantly understudied, is the role that dynamically changing discharge has on the hyporheic exchange process and how regional groundwater flow modulates the effects of transience. In this study, we use a reduced-complexity model to systematically explore the bedform-induced hyporheic responses to dynamically changing discharge events in systems with different bedform geometries exposed to varying degrees of groundwater flow (under both upwelling and downwelling conditions). With this in mind, we define metrics to quantify the effects of transience: spatial extent of the hyporheic zone, net hyporheic flux, mean residence time, and denitrification efficiency. We find that regional groundwater flow and geomorphological settings greatly modulate the temporal evolution of bedform-induced hyporheic responses driven by a single-peak discharge event. Effects of transience diminish with increasing groundwater upwelling or downwelling fluxes, decreasing bedform aspect ratios, and decreasing channel slopes. Additionally, we notice that increasing discharge intensities can reduce the modulating impacts of regional groundwater flow on the effects of transience but hardly overcomes the geomorphological controls. These findings highlight the necessities of evaluating hyporheic exchange processes in a more comprehensive framework.Show less"
17,"Paris, CB",Dec 2008 ,River-reef connectivity in the Meso-American Region,CORAL REEFS,"The accumulation and seasonal impact of riverine discharge on coral reefs of the Meso-American Region (MAR) were estimated using a numerical simulation of river runoff dispersion. River-reef connectivity, or source-sink dynamics of terrestrial runoff was further assessed from more than 400 watersheds of the region onto discrete coral reef areas. Using land use for 2003 and 2004 in the MAR, this work builds upon a Regional Ocean Modeling System simulation of the MAR validated by ocean color satellite data, and on the monthly river nutrient and sediment load and discharge provided by the World Resources Institute using the N-SPECT model. Analysis of the variability of simulated runoff transport to the reefs showed that reefs of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) were mostly impacted from June to September, following the peak time of river discharge. At that time, the coastal and oceanic circulations contribute quickly to expel the runoff from the MBRS. High runoff concentration waters leaving the eastern coast of Honduras during the months of October to December return to the southwestern MAR in March as they are entrained in a cyclonic gyre. Coral reefs of the MAR are thus impacted twice, first from the coastal side with runoff of local origin and later from the oceanic side with runoff from mixed origin. High probability of connectivity between rivers and remote reefs is established as this study revealed that river runoff from the north shore of Honduras has a wide-spread impact on most of the coral reefs of southern Belize, while watersheds on the Gulf of Honduras are mostly connected to coral reefs in the northern shore of Honduras. Although the level of remote influence (or runoff concentration reaching the reef) is lower than the local, the cumulative effect of numerous remote river-reef connections remains significant.Show less"
18,"Ward, AS",Jun 15 2018 ,"Streambed restoration to remove fine sediment alters reach-scale transient storage in a low-gradient fifth-order river, Indiana, USA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hyporheic restoration is of increasing interest given the role of hyporheic zones in supporting ecosystem services and functions. Given the prevalence of sediment pollution to waterways, an emerging restoration technique involves the removal of sediment from the interstices of gravel-bed streams. Here, we document streambed sediment removal following a large, accidental release of fine sediment into a gravel-bed river. We use this as a natural experiment to assess the impact of fine sediment removal on reach-scale measures of transient storage and to document the responses of reaches with contrasting morphology (restored vs. unrestored) to changing discharge one-field season. We conducted a series of conservative solute tracer experiments in each reach, interpreting both summary statistics for the recovered in-stream solute tracer time series. Additionally, we applied the transient storage model to interpret the results via model parameters, including a Monte Carlo analysis to measure parameter identifiability and sensitivity in each experiment. Despite the restoration effort resulting in an open matrix gravel bed in the restored reach, we did not find the significant differences in most time series metrics describing reach-scale transport and transient storage. We hypothesize that this is due to enhanced vertical exchange with the gravel bed in the restored reach replacing lateral exchange with macrophyte beds in the unrestored reach, developing a conceptual model to explain our findings. Consequently, we found that the impact of reach-scale removal of fine sediment is not measureable using reach-scale solute tracer studies. We offer recommendations for future studies seeking to measure the impacts of stream restoration at the reach scale.Show less"
19,"Perez, ABA",Jun 2020 ,Connectivity of Ephemeral and Intermittent Streams in a Subtropical Atlantic Forest Headwater Catchment,WATER,"Stream network extension and contraction depend on landscape features and the characteristics of precipitation events. Although this dependency is widely recognized, the interaction among overland-flow generation processes, drainage active length, and frequency in temporary streams remains less understood. We studied a forest headwater catchment with wide variation in soil depth to investigate the runoff generation processes that lead to the occurrence of ephemeral and intermittent flow and connectivity between hillslope and outlet. We used low-cost equipment to monitor the variation in the length of the active drainage network and to measure the water table development. The flow in the channels can develop even under light rainfall conditions, while the connectivity is controlled by antecedent wetness, total precipitation, and active contribution area thresholds. Runoff permanence and fragmentation were related to soil depth variation; flow being usually more disconnected due to deeper water tables in deeper soil locations. Our findings emphasized the impact of soil structure on runoff generation in hillslopes and can be useful in the management of the most active areas and their impact on the quality of available water.Show less"
20,"Ali, G",Aug 2017 ,Groundwater-Driven Wetland-Stream Connectivity in the Prairie Pothole Region: Inferences Based on Electrical Conductivity Data,WETLANDS,"This study examined the potential for electrical conductivity (EC) to serve as an indicator of groundwater-driven wetland-stream connectivity in the Prairie Pothole Region. Focus was on the Broughton's Creek Watershed (Manitoba, Canada) where thirteen wetlands and a creek were monitored in 2013-2014. A connectivity index (CI), computed by incorporating EC data in a hyperbolic solute export model, identified a potential for both shallow and deep groundwater-driven wetland-stream connectivity to occur, although shallower connections were rarer. Both raw EC and CI values were strongly correlated to wetland volume capacity, indicating the importance of storage and flow generation processes for wetland-stream connectivity potential. The proposed CI was instrumental in reaching that conclusion, making it a simple yet physically-based metric of wetland behavior that should be tested in multiple environments to confirm or infirm its validity.Show less"
21,"Harrison, AM",Nov 2019 ,Hyporheic Interactions Increase Zinc Exposure and Effects on Hyalella azteca in Sediments under Flow-Through Conditions,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Groundwater-surface water interactions in the hyporheic transition zone can influence contaminant exposure to benthic macroinvertebrates. In streams, hyporheic flows are subject to varying redox conditions, which influence biogeochemical cycling and metal speciation. Despite these relationships, little is known about how these interactions influence the ecological risk of contaminants. The present study investigated the effects of hyporheic flows and zinc (Zn)-contaminated sediments on the amphipod Hyalella azteca. Hyporheic flows were manipulated in laboratory streams during 10-d experiments. Zinc toxicity was evaluated in freshly spiked and aged sediments. Hyporheic flows altered sediment and porewater geochemistry, oxidizing the sediments and causing changes to redox-sensitive endpoints. Amphipod survival was lowest in the Zn sediment exposures with hyporheic flows. In freshly spiked sediments, porewater Zn drove mortality, whereas in aged sediments simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in excess of acid volatile sulfides (AVS) normalized by the fraction of organic carbon (fOC) [(SEM-AVS)/fOC] influenced amphipod responses. The results highlight the important role of hyporheic flows in determining Zn bioavailability to benthic organisms, information that can be important in ecological risk assessments.

Heat tracing is a potentially useful method to characterize these hyporheic flow paths and quantify associated fluxes. Temperature was monitored within a PRP sequence for several days. Temperature in the hyporheic zone reflected the diel temperature change in the river but not uniformly. The observed thermal pattern exhibited deeper penetration of thermal oscillations below the head pool and shallower penetration below the tail pool. This pattern is consistent with the conceptual model of hyporheic exchange over a PRP sequence. One-dimensional analytical heat transport models were used at different points below the PRP sequence to estimate distributed vertical fluid fluxes. The calculated fluxes exhibit a trend that follows the expected distribution for a PRP sequence but modified for a losing stream (net fluid flux into the streambed). Deviation of both magnitude and distribution of fluxes from the conceptual ""downwelling-to-upwelling"" model is due partly to the dominantly losing conditions at the study site, but the trends are consistent with a losing stream undergoing hyporheic exchange. Violation of the assumptions in the analytical models most likely adds error to flux estimates. For this study, flux estimation methods using a temperature time-series amplitude analysis more closely matched field measurements than phase methods.Show less"
23,"Rohmat, FIW",Dec 2019 ,Deep learning for compute-efficient modeling of BMP impacts on stream-aquifer exchange and water law compliance in an irrigated river basin,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"Inefficient irrigation practices in the alluvial Lower Arkansas River Basin (LARB) of Colorado are contributing to salinization, waterlogging, reduced crop yields, and harmful concentrations of pollutants in the stream-aquifer system. Intensive data collection and modeling efforts in the LARB over the past 20 years have resulted in development of the GIS-based basin-scale decision support system River GeoDSS. Parallel efforts in regional-scale calibration and application of the MODFLOW-SFR2-RT3D-OTIS stream-aquifer system model permit evaluation of best management practices (BMPs) designed to mollify adverse environmental impacts. Since BMP implementation is allowable only if water laws are not violated, a deep learning model is developed to serve as an accurate, compute-efficient surrogate of MODFLOW-SFR2 and is imbedded in River GeoDSS for assessing basin-scale impacts of BMP implementations on stream-aquifer exchange and water rights. It is shown that BMPs can be implemented while maintaining reasonable water law compliance with development of a new reservoir storage account.Show less"
24,"Sliva, L",Oct 1 2005 ,Responses of hyporheic meiofauna to habitat manipulation,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Interactions between interstitial meiofauna and physicochemical parameters of the hyporheic zone were examined via an in situ experiment on the Speed River, Ontario. The manipulation comprised reversing upwelllng and downwelling zones at the riffle scale, and was maintained for I month. Significant differences in physicochemical parameters were detected between zones and between treatments (control vs. manipulated). Depth-related variables, such as sediment particle size, were most important in structuring the hyporheic community during pre- and post-manipulation phases. Flow reversal was largely successful, with more significant changes occurring in the original downwelling zone. For example, change from downwelling to upwelling resulted in decreased larval chironomid dominance but an increase in the numbers of oligochaetes, nematodes, mites, and copepods. However, under field conditions, it was difficult to keep other variables, such as water temperature, constant and some of these may have contributed to the changes seen in the meiofauna.Show less"

26,"Ward, AS",Nov 2019 ,"Solute Transport and Transformation in an Intermittent, Headwater Mountain Stream with Diurnal Discharge Fluctuations",WATER,"Time-variable discharge is known to control both transport and transformation of solutes in the river corridor. Still, few studies consider the interactions of transport and transformation together. Here, we consider how diurnal discharge fluctuations in an intermittent, headwater stream control reach-scale solute transport and transformation as measured with conservative and reactive tracers during a period of no precipitation. One common conceptual model is that extended contact times with hyporheic zones during low discharge conditions allows for increased transformation of reactive solutes. Instead, we found tracer timescales within the reach were related to discharge, described by a single discharge-variable StorAge Selection function. We found that Resazurin to Resorufin (Raz-to-Rru) transformation is static in time, and apparent differences in reactive tracer were due to interactions with different ages of storage, not with time-variable reactivity. Overall we found reactivity was highest in youngest storage locations, with minimal Raz-to-Rru conversion in waters older than about 20 h of storage in our study reach. Therefore, not all storage in the study reach has the same potential biogeochemical function and increasing residence time of solute storage does not necessarily increase reaction potential of that solute, contrary to prevailing expectations.Show less"
27,"Shi, YZ",Oct 2022 ,Double-coupling learning for multi-task data stream classification,INFORMATION SCIENCES,"Data stream classification methods exploiting cohesion in a single data stream have demonstrated promising performance. However, scenarios involving multiple data streams are indeed common in practice. They involve several correlated data streams and can be viewed as multi-task data streams. Instead of considering them separately as individual data streams, it is beneficial to leverage the correlations among the multi-task data streams in data stream modeling. In this regard, a novel classification method called double -coupling support vector machines (DC-SVM) is proposed to classify multiple data streams simultaneously, where both the external correlations between multiple data streams and the internal relationships within each individual data stream are considered. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world multi-task data streams show that the proposed method outperforms traditional data stream classification methods. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

29,"Tan, K",Dec 2021 ,Variation in processes structuring fish assemblages as inferred from metacommunity analyses: Differences between headwater and adventitious streams within a river network,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Community assembly is generally affected by the spatial position of local patches. Examining metacommunity processes and structures in small streams with different river network positions (e.g., headwater streams in the periphery of river networks vs adventitious streams in relatively central positions) may help us better understand how spatial position influences metacommunity structuring. In this study, based on data collected from sampling 24 headwater and 15 adventitious stream sites in the Xin'an Basin, China, we examined whether and how fish metacommunity processes and structures differed between the 2 stream types. We used distanced-based redundancy analysis coupled with forward selection to assess the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in metacommunity processes, and we applied the elements of metacommunity structure analysis, extended by using different ordinations, to identify metacommunity structures. We found that the 2 types of streams were similar in environmental heterogeneity, but fish assemblages in adventitious streams were more dissimilar to one another than were assemblages in headwater streams and had more riverine immigrants. The amount of among-stream variation in species composition was low in both stream types. In headwater streams, assemblage-environment relationships were stronger than assemblage-space relationships, but we found the opposite pattern in adventitious streams. Species turnover was strong in both headwater and adventitious streams. However, assemblages in headwater streams showed both nested and quasi-nested structures, whereas the assemblages in adventitious streams were more consistent with Clementsian structure. Our results suggest that different metacommunity processes may occur in small streams with distinct river network positions and that extended elements of metacommunity structure analysis can help identify the underlying mechanisms that produce metacommunity structure. The effect of spatial position within river networks on stream fish metacommunity structuring appears to be weak, but our analyses do imply that river immigrants can influence species composition in adventitious streams to some extent.Show less"
30,"Stoffels, RJ",May 2022 ,Fragmentation of lateral connectivity and fish population dynamics in large rivers,FISH AND FISHERIES,"Lateral Hydrological Connectivity (LHC) has been extensively fragmented in river-floodplain ecosystems of the world. Uncertainties about how LHC affects fishes are great, impeding the design of effective rehabilitation strategies. Existing conceptual frameworks do not provide sufficient mechanistic detail to support the novel decision problems river managers face. We offer a framework of how LHC affects fishes in river-floodplain ecosystems that is, process-based, integrates all life-stages and is spatial; these features, we argue, are required to assess risks and opportunities associated with different LHC rehabilitation strategies. Within river-floodplain segments, LHC affects population processes through five 'effect-classes': effects of floodplain habitat (1) and channel habitat (2); effects of material subsidies from the floodplain to the channel (3) and vice versa (4); and effects of connectivity on lateral dispersal (5). The relative influence of these effect-classes on processes varies among species and life-stages. At the scale of the drainage basin, inter-segment variation in geomorphology generates a longitudinal source-sink structure to habitat quality and quantity, pointing to a need to better understand fish metapopulation dynamics in river-floodplain ecosystems. Given the significant investment in trying to restore river-floodplain ecosystems, we highlight potentially costly and ineffective LHC management decisions. These include certain heavily engineered LHC rehabilitation strategies that do not promote critical population processes at a local scale, and at basin scales implementing strategies that do not facilitate the metapopulation processes that promote species' persistence.Show less"
31,"Zenagui, I",Jan 2020 ,Nutrient dynamics in a hyporheic zone in response to a severe and prolonged dry period in a semi-arid river (Tafna wadi),ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Against the backdrop of recent climate change issues, the intensity of dry periods is increasing in semi-arid environments due to high temperatures, evaporation and a shortage of precipitation in summer. The Tafna catchment, which is located in north-western Algeria and is characterised by a Mediterranean climate with a sub-dry tendency, has been subject to severe and prolonged dry periods. In order to understand the impact of prolonged dry periods on biogeochemical processes and nutrient exchange between surface water (SW) and hyporheic water (HW) within the (study) catchment, four sets of samples were taken upstream of the Tafna wadi during low-water (LW) periods over two years (2014-2015). Nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and chloride were measured in surface water (SW) and hyporheic water (HW) at depths of 30, 60 and 100 cm. The results showed a significant loss of nitrate and a considerable increase in ammonium in the hyporheic zone (HZ) during these severe conditions. This could be related to (i) high rates of denitrification and (ii) the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). This study indicated that a severe drought directly affects the nitrogen cycle that occurs in a hyporheic zone (HZ), and thus affects the functioning of this area relative to the wadi system as a whole.Show less"
32,"Marttila, H",Jun 2019 ,Contribution of flow conditions and sand addition on hyporheic zone exchange in gravel beds,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,"We conducted a series of tracer test experiments in 12 outdoor semi-natural flumes to assess the effects of variable flow conditions and sand addition on hyporheic zone conditions in gravel beds, mimicking conditions in headwater streams under sediment pressure. Two tracer methods were applied in each experiment: 2-5 tracer-pulse tests were conducted in all flumes and pulses were monitored at three distances downstream of the flume inlet (0 m, 5 m and 10 m, at bed surface), and in pipes installed into the gravel bed at 5 m and 10 m distances. The tracer breakthrough curves (total of 120 tracer injections) were then analysed with a one-dimensional solute transport model (OTIS) and compared with data from the gravel pipes in point-dilution pulse tests. Sand addition had a strong negative effect on horizontal fluxes (q(h)), whereas the fraction of the median travel time due to transient storage (F-200) was determined more by flow conditions. These results suggest that even small additions of sand can modify the hyporheic zone exchange in gravel beds, thus making headwater streams with low sediment transport capacity particularly vulnerable to sediments transported into the stream from catchment land use activities.Show less"
33,"Wang, DY",Sep 1 2020 ,Environmental gradient relative to oxbow lake-meandering river connectivity in Zoige Basin of the Tibetan Plateau,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Oxbow lakes generated from meandering river cutoffs are an indispensable component of riparian ecosystem. This study aimed to examine whether predictable patterns in water properties arise relative to oxbow lake geometry and lake-channel connectivity. We selected 24 oxbow lakes along a meandering river belt in Zoige Basin, the Tibetan Plateau, to conduct field work at the beginning (May) and the end (September) of the flood season, 2019. Six parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, total dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) were measured to represent water property. Lake surface area, length, width, length/width ratio, distance to active channel, and curvature were measured to represent lake geometry. Shrinkage ratio, defined as current lake length/initial lake length, was measured to represent lake-channel connectivity between oxbow lakes and active channel. We found an environmental gradient relative to connectivity. As oxbow lakes aged and gradually disconnected from the channel, increased DO and nutrients drove the lakes towards eutrophication. This trend however was disturbed by (i) flood pulses that diluted nutrient concentrations in oxbow lakes and narrowed the differences among different types of lakes and the channel through altering lake-channel connectivity, and (ii) lateral meander migration passed through older lakes such that regulated water properties by reconnecting older lakes to newly formed lakes. Maintenance or restoration of connectivity thus should be of great importance to prevent oxbow lakes from eutrophication in meandering river belts in Zoige Basin.Show less"
34,"Naus, CJ",Jan 2018 ,"Fish nursery habitat function of the main channel, floodplain tributaries and oxbow lakes of a medium-sized river",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,"Small, adventitious tributaries (<3 orders of magnitude smaller than the stream it flows into) are a conspicuous feature of many river-floodplain systems, but their value as fish reproduction and nursery habitat is not well understood compared to oxbow lakes and the main river channel (MRC). Moreover, connectivity of tributaries to the MRC is often less impacted by anthropogenic modifications (e.g., dams and levees) compared to oxbow lakes. From April to July 2012, larval and juvenile fish were collected in the Fourche LaFave River (Arkansas, USA) system to better understand fish nursery habitat function of tributaries relative to oxbow lakes and the MRC. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination of juvenile and larval fish genera revealed distinct fish assemblages in MRC and floodplain habitats. Ordination of juvenile fish at the species level resulted in distinct fish assemblages in tributary versus oxbow lake habitats. Tributaries had more unique species and higher abundance of shared species than oxbow lakes and MRC. Additionally, of the 46 species identified, all but six were collected in lower tributary reaches. Connectivity was strongly associated with both ordinations and was important in describing patterns of fish variation among habitats and between tributaries. Of the tributaries sampled, the least fragmented stream had the most similar fish assemblages between upper and lower sections. Findings of this study revealed tributaries are an important, yet overlooked, feature in the river-floodplain model. Especially in years of drought, channel-floodplain connectivity can be limited, but tributaries can be used by fishes for reproduction and nursery habitat.Show less"
35,"Ho, DT",Nov 2011 ,On Factors Controlling Air-Water Gas Exchange in a Large Tidal River,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,"Air-water gas exchange is an important process in aquatic systems, including tidal rivers and estuaries. While there are now reliable and routine methods for determining gas exchange over a range of temporal and spatial scales in the ocean and these measurements have resulted in widely used wind speed parameterizations to calculate air-sea gas exchange, the same has not been true for coastal inland waterways. Some studies have suggested that this difference is methodological, while others point to the existence of additional drivers for gas exchange besides wind in rivers and estuaries. Here, we present gas transfer velocities measured in the tidal Hudson River with a method widely used in oceanic studies, the He-3/SF6 dual tracer technique. Airside and waterside forcings were determined with an anemometer and an acoustic Doppler current profiler, respectively. The results confirm that wind is the dominant driver of gas exchange in the tidal Hudson River, with negligible contribution from bottom-generated turbulence. Furthermore, a parameterization between wind speed and gas exchange developed for the ocean is able to predict gas exchange in this environment with high accuracy. It is hoped that by transferring methodology used in oceanic studies to rivers and estuaries, robust data can be obtained that will eventually allow development of widely applicable relationships between easily measured environmental variables and gas exchange in tidal inland waters.Show less"

37,"Bottacin-Busolin, A",Aug 10 2010 ,Combined role of advective pumping and mechanical dispersion on time scales of bed form-induced hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"This study analyzes the effect of advective pumping and pore scale dispersion on bed form-induced hyporheic exchange. Advection and dispersion play a competitive role in the exchange dynamics between the porous medium and the overlying stream: Advective fluxes first lead solutes deep into the bed and then back to the stream water, whereas dispersive fluxes favor the transfer of solutes deep into the bed leading to a permanent mass retention. The combined effect of advective exchange and dispersive fluxes produces complexity in the shape of the tails of the residence time distributions (RTDs), which follow at various stages of the process either a power law or an exponential decay. The seepage velocity induced by the stream gradient and, in case of a moving bed, the celerity of the translating bed forms limit the thickness of the advective hyporheic zone, inducing the RTDs to decrease rapidly at late time. This rapid decay can be preceded by a temporal region where the probability density functions (pdf's) tend to be inversely proportional to the square of time, and is followed by a region dominated by dispersion where the pdf's tend to be inversely proportional to the 3/2 power of time. The process shows distinct temporal ranges identified here by appropriate dimensionless parameters. Because of this complex exchange dynamics, models considering pure advection in the porous medium can significantly underestimate solute transfer at long time scales, whereas purely diffusive models of hyporheic exchange appear inadequate to represent the physical processes at an intermediate stage.Show less"
38,"Malzone, JM",Mar-apr 2015 ,Focused Groundwater Controlled Feedbacks into the Hyporheic Zone During Baseflow Recession,GROUNDWATER,"Groundwater surface water interaction in the hyporheic zone remains an important challenge for water resources management and ecosystem restoration. In heterogeneous stratified glacial sediments, reach-scale environments contain an uneven distribution of focused groundwater flow occurring simultaneously with diffusely discharging groundwater. This results in a variation of stream-aquifer interactions, where focused flow systems are able to temporally dominate exchange processes. The research presented here investigates the direct and indirect influences focused groundwater discharge exerts on the hyporheic zone during baseflow recession. Field results demonstrate that as diffuse sources of groundwater deplete during baseflow recession, focused groundwater discharge remains constant. During baseflow recession the hyporheic zone is unable to expand, while the high nitrate concentration from focused discharge changes the chemistry of the stream. The final result is a higher concentration of nitrate in the hyporheic zone as this altered surface water infiltrates into the subsurface. This indirect coupling of focused groundwater discharge and the hyporheic zone is unaccounted for in hyporheic studies at this time. Results indicate important implications for the potential reduction of agricultural degradation of water quality.Show less"
39,"Crenshaw, CL",Oct 2002 ,Effects of augmentation of coarse particulate organic matter on metabolism and nutrient retention in hyporheic sediments,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Metabolic and biogeochemical processes in hyporheic zones may depend on inputs of coarse particulate organic matter. Our research focused on how differing quantity and quality of organic matter affects metabolism and nutrient retention in the hyporheic zone of a first-order Appalachian stream.2. Sixteen plots were established on a tributary of Hugh White Creek, NC, U.S.A. Sediment was extracted and treated with leaves, wood, plastic strips or remained unamended. Following treatment, sediment was returned to the stream and, approximately 3 months later, samples were removed from each plot.3. Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism were measured as the change in O-2 and CO2 in recirculating microcosms. At the same time, we monitored other possible terminal electron accepting processes and changes in nutrient concentrations. Aerobic metabolism was low in all treatments and respiratory quotients calculated for all treatments indicated that metabolism was dominated by anaerobic processes.4. Rates of anaerobic respiration and total (combined aerobic and anaerobic) respiration were significantly greater (P < 0.05) in plots treated with leaf organic matter compared to controls.5. Addition of leaves, which had a low C:N ratio, stimulated respiration in hyporheic sediments. Anaerobic processes dominated metabolism in both control and amended sediments. Enhanced metabolic rates increased retention of many solutes, indicating that energy flow and nutrient dynamics in the subsurface of streams may depend upon the quantity and quality of imported carbon.Show less"
40,"Peterson, EW",Mar 2013 ,Factors influencing nitrate within a low-gradient agricultural stream,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"In low-gradient agricultural streams, the proportion of land use devoted to agriculture, the sinuosity of the stream and the time of year influence the concentration of nitrate in the stream waters. Land use influences the source of nitrate and also the morphology of the stream. Greater agricultural land use weakly correlated (r = 0.67) to higher nitrate concentrations. Streams in agricultural areas have been straightened, which decreases the sinuosity. As a stream meanders and becomes more sinuous, the potential for lateral hyporheic flow increases, which can enhance a stream system's ability to remove nitrate. Logically, higher sinuous streams should remove more nitrate and likely sulfate as there is a greater potential for lateral hyporheic flows. To test this hypothesis, nitrate and sulfate were monitored. Mass fluxes of nitrate along six stream segments with varying sinuosity values were calculated and statistically analyzed to assess if differences in mass fluxes along the segments existed. Along the segments, there are statistically significant differences in the mass fluxes of nitrate [F(5,174) = 4.777; p = 0.001]. Stream segments with higher sinuosity index values exhibited a loss or lower gain in nitrate and sulfate than lower sinuosity index segments. The data suggest that stream segments with high sinuosity indices provide greater stream distance and increased hyporheic interaction within the streambed. Additionally, the more sinuous segments provide for an increase in lateral hyporheic flow beneath meander lobes. These additional hyporheic flows lead to enhanced denitrification in low-gradient agricultural streams. Seasonal differences were also noted. August through October experienced the lower nitrate concentrations as compared to June and July which exhibited the highest nitrate concentrations.Show less"
41,"Lane, CR",Apr 2018 ,"Hydrological, Physical, and Chemical Functions and Connectivity of Non-Floodplain Wetlands to Downstream Waters: A Review",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"We reviewed the scientific literature on non-floodplain wetlands (NFWs), freshwater wetlands typically located distal to riparian and floodplain systems, to determine hydrological, physical, and chemical functioning and stream and river network connectivity. We assayed the literature for source, sink, lag, and transformation functions, as well as factors affecting connectivity. We determined NFWs are important landscape components, hydrologically, physically, and chemically affecting downstream aquatic systems. NFWs are hydrologic and chemical sources for other waters, hydrologically connecting across long distances and contributing compounds such as methylated mercury and dissolved organic matter. NFWs reduced flood peaks and maintained baseflows in stream and river networks through hydrologic lag and sink functions, and sequestered or assimilated substantial nutrient inputs through chemical sink and transformative functions. Landscape-scale connectivity of NFWs affects water and material fluxes to downstream river networks, substantially modifying the characteristics and function of downstream waters. Many factors determine the effects of NFW hydrological, physical, and chemical functions on downstream systems, and additional research quantifying these factors and impacts is warranted. We conclude NFWs are hydrologically, chemically, and physically interconnected with stream and river networks though this connectivity varies in frequency, duration, magnitude, and timing.Show less"
42,"Briggs, MA",Feb 26 2009 ,A method for estimating surface transient storage parameters for streams with concurrent hyporheic storage,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Application of transient storage models has become popular for characterizing hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in streams. The typical transient storage model represents exchange between the main channel and a single storage zone, essentially lumping together different exchange processes. Here we present a method to inform a transient storage model that accounts for two storage zones (2-SZ) to discriminate between surface transient storage (STS) exchange and exchange with hyporheic transient storage (HTS). This method requires that, in addition to tracer breakthrough curves from the main channel, cross-sectional stream velocity distributions and stream tracer concentration time series data from several main channel locations and adjacent representative STS zones be collected. We apply this method to a constant rate conservative tracer injection in a first-order stream and to an instantaneous slug conservative tracer injection in a fourth-order stream. The 2-SZ model simulations matched observed breakthrough curves of tracer concentration in the main channel and general STS behavior well. Additionally, we compared the optimized parameter sets of the 2-SZ model to one-storage zone model (1-SZ) simulations and found that the lumped storage terms of the 1-SZ model described the time scales of 2-SZ model HTS exchange and attributed the time scales of observed STS exchange to longitudinal dispersion. With additional field data collection efforts and data processing, this method can provide much more useful results than the 1-SZ approach to those interested in discriminating between surface and subsurface transient storage dynamics of streams, which is important for discerning processes important to the cycling and fate of biogeochemicals.Show less"
43,"Gomez-Velez, JD",Jun 2014 ,Effect of low-permeability layers on spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange and groundwater upwelling,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bed form-induced hyporheic interactions are characterized by a nested system of flow paths that continuously exchange water, solutes, momentum, and energy. At the local scale, sediment heterogeneity plays a key role in the hydrodynamics and potential for biogeochemical transformations within the hyporheic zone. This manuscript explores the role of low-permeability sedimentary layers on the interplay between bed form-induced hyporheic exchange and groundwater upwelling. A hydrodynamic conceptualization that sequentially couples fully-turbulent flow in the water column and Darcian flow in the sediment is used. Low-permeability layers are characterized by long residence times and solute accumulation. Furthermore, these layers induce hydrodynamic sequestration due to the relocation and, in some cases, emergence of new stagnation zones. Spatial patterns of residence time distributions and flushing intensities indicate that the interface of the low-permeability layers has the potential to be a hot spot for biogeochemical transformations and flow acceleration near such interface can increase the mobilization capacity for the products of redox chemical and microbial processes. A discussion about the possible implications that hydrodynamic changes have on the biogeochemistry of hyporheic zones is presented; however, further biogeochemical experimentation and modeling are needed to validate these arguments.Show less"

Nitrogen cycling,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The objective of this study was to quantify subsurface nitrogen fluxes between a riparian forest and a 4th-order mountain stream, McRae Creek, for each season of the year and during storms. A network of wells was installed on a gravel bar and a portion of the adjacent floodplain between 1989 and 1992. Water samples were collected to monitor dissolved nitrogen concentrations Advected channel water and ground water were enriched in nitrogen relative to the stream; thus, subsurface flow was a net source of nitrogen to the stream in all seasons of the year and during both base-flow periods and storms. Estimates of the flux of advected channel water and the discharge of ground water were combined with changes in mean nitrogen concentrations along subsurface flow paths to estimate nitrogen inputs to the stream. Discharge of ground water from the conifer-dominated floodplain was the largest source of nitrogen added to the stream; however, more than 50% of this nitrogen was dissolved organic nitrogen. In contrast, two-thirds of the nitrogen from the alder-dominated gravel bar was inorganic. Net nitrogen fluxes from the gravel bar to the stream were lowest during the summer when water table elevations were low. Net fluxes of nitrogen from the gravel bar to the stream were largest during the fall, especially at peak flow during storms when interstitial water in the gravel bar was enriched in NO3-. The estimated annual flux of nitrogen from the riparian forest to McRae Creek was 1.9 g/m(2) of streambed, of which 1.0 g/m(2) was inorganic. Estimated net annual flux was large relative to the estimated input of nitrogen in litterfall, or the nitrogen required to support estimated rates of primary productivity.Show less"
45,"Courtice, GJ",Feb 2016 ,Stream habitat connectivity in the Canadian Arctic: an on-site approach to design and construction,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,"We developed a successful on-site approach for design and construction of stream modifications that addressed challenging remote-site conditions of limited field data and available construction materials. Fish habitat connectivity enhancements were constructed within an Arctic headwater stream containing a naturally impassable cascade section with 13% slope, which was bypassed in a newly constructed channel at 5% slope with nature-like fishpass structures. Primary design considerations included (1) creating suitable hydraulic characteristics for fish passage in periods of high and low discharges; (2) reducing drop heights and creating unimpeded flow paths; (3) improving hydraulic complexity for a variety of stream habitats; and (4) salvaging and incorporating vegetation disturbed from construction activities into riparian and in-stream habitat structures. In high gradient reaches (2.5%-5%), we constructed boulder weirs, boulder chokes, and deflection boulders to overcome migration impediments. In medium gradient reaches (1.5-2.5%), rock ramps, boulder chokes, and deflection boulders were constructed to control hydraulic characteristics to ensure an unimpeded flow path, suitable hydraulic complexity, and resting zones. At lower gradients (<1.5%), we incorporated a softer approach using riparian vegetation and in-stream woody debris to ensure a similar quality of fish habitat as created in the higher gradient reaches. Initial hydraulic responses to the modifications indicated this reconstructed channel provided suitable hydraulic and habitat characteristics for habitat connectivity throughout the entire stream. Our findings advance understanding of headwater stream hydraulics in the Canadian Arctic and will assist in designing future stream restoration and fish habitat compensation projects on small and remote systems. This case study supports the feasibility of successfully constructing future habitat compensation projects in challenging remote environments when using an on-site, adaptive design and construction approach.Show less"
46,"Vautier, C",Feb 2020 ,Mapping gas exchanges in headwater streams with membrane inlet mass spectrometry,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Using continuous injections of helium coupled to in-situ continuous flow membrane inlet mass spectrometry (CF-MIMS), we mapped the gas exchanges along two low-slope headwater streams having discharges of 25 L s(-1) and 90 L s(-1). Mean reaeration rate coefficients (k(2)) were estimated at 130 d(-1) and 60 d(-1), respectively. Our study revealed that gas exchanges along headwater streams are highly heterogeneous. The variable morphology of the streambed causes gas exchanges to be focused into small areas, namely small cascades made up of stones or wood, with reaeration rate coefficients up to 40 times higher than in low-turbulent zones. As such, cascades appear to be hot spots for both oxygenation and greenhouse gases emissions. Additional O-2 and CO2 measurements effectively showed fast exchanges between the stream and the atmosphere in the cascades, following the partial pressure gradients. These cascades allow a fast oxygenation of the eutrophic streams depleted in O-2, which sustains respiration. Simultaneously, cascades release the oversaturated CO2 originating from groundwater inputs to the atmosphere. By comparing measured reaeration rate coefficients to ten predictive equations from literature, we showed that all equations systematically underestimate reaeration rate coefficients, with significantly higher discrepancies in cascades than in low-turbulent zones. The inadequate characterization of the processes occurring in cascades causes empirical equations to have poor predictive capabilities, leading to a global underestimation of CO2 emission from headwater streams.Show less"
47,"Zhang, C",Nov 2022 ,Evaluation of hydrological connectivity in a river floodplain system and its influence on the vegetation coverage,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The river floodplain system is the basis of material and energy exchange between the river and floodplain in a region, and its connectivity is an important basis for water health evaluation and ecological protection. To clarify the effects of hydrological connectivity changes on vegetation, the graph theory method was improved based on ArcGIS and a quantitative evaluation model of river floodplain system hydrological connectivity was established. Taking the Jiahetan river floodplain system in the lower Yellow River basin as an example, the variation trend of hydrological connectivity in this region in the last 36 years and the influence of the Xiaolangdi Dam on hy-drological connectivity was analyzed, and the response law of vegetation in the floodplain to the change of hydrological connectivity under different water surface ratios was obtained. The results show that because of Xiaolangdi Dam operation, the hydrological connectivity and vegetation coverage of Jiahetan increased by 28.09 % and 17.73 % on average, respectively, in the flood season. In the non-flood season, hydrological con-nectivity decreased by 22.91 % and vegetation coverage increased by 164.82 % on average. It is beneficial for vegetation growth to keep the hydrological connectivity value around 0.4 in the flood season and 0.3 in the non -flood season. These results provide a quantitative analysis technique for the evaluation of river floodplain hy-drological connectivity, with the characteristics of a simple evaluation process and good applicability, and have important scientific significance and wide application value in providing guidance and decision-making assis-tance for the protection and restoration of floodplain water ecology, river system connectivity planning, and water and sediment regulation.Show less"
48,"Knowlton, MF",Jun 2003 ,Connectivity influences temporal variation of limnological conditions in Missouri River scour lakes,LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT,"Two scour takes in the Missouri River floodplain were sampled 20 months (April 1996 - December 1997) to examine effects of river inflow on mixing, seston, and nutrient dynamics. Lake NC-11 (approximate to4 ha) is deep (approximate to16 m), sheltered, dimictic, and connected to the river only during floods. Lake S-19 (approximate to20 ha) comprises two sub-basins, a deep (approximate to12 m) riverine forewater perennially connected to the river and a shallow (approximate to4 m), polymictic backwater of variable connectivity. Stratification in NC-11 affected, and was affected by, river inputs - cool inflows mixed completely and sometimes destratified the lake, warmer inflows were partly or completely confined to the epilimnion. Mixing between basins at S-19 was incomplete except during floods. During floods, concentrations of seston and particulate N and P were similar in the two basins of S-19, but conditions in the two basins diverged substantially during inter-flood periods as lower water levels reduced lateral exchange. Seston concentrations in NC-11 during floods were much less (approximate to90% less) than in S-19 or the river. In NC-11, algal blooms (chlorophyll 50-90 mug . L-1) occurred in summer post-flood periods, but larger blooms (chlorophyll 50-256 mug . L-1) occurred in the S-19 backwater during periods of low connectivity in all seasons. Nitrate-N peaked at > 2 mg.L-1 during floods but was exhausted during algal blooms along with up to approximate to90% of dissolved phosphorus Silica declined sharply (up to 93%) in many, but not all blooms, but remained >0.5 mg.L-1 in all observations. Connectivity influenced many take features and enhanced nutrient availability, but other floodplain lakes lacking river connections have similar algal biomass.Show less"
49,"Wondzell, SM",Feb 1999 ,"Floods, channel change, and the hyporheic zone",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We investigated the influence of flood-induced channel changes on the hyporheic zone of 4th- and 5th-order reaches of a mountain stream network. Preflood versus postflood comparisons were made in three study reaches from well networks established before and reestablished after a major flood. Flood effects were scale dependent and varied with channel constraint and the dominant channel forming process. Large changes were observed in unconstrained stream reaches where channel incision drove large changes in subsurface flow paths and the extent of the hyporheic zone. However, subreach scale differences were apparent. In the lower portion of the studied reach, channel incision lowered the water table, leading to abandonment of secondary channels, and decreased the extent of the hyporheic zone that previously extended more than 30 m into the floodplain. In contrast, the extent of the hyporheic zone increased at the head of the studied reach where channel incision steepened head gradients through a meander bend. In another unconstrained reach, lateral channel jumps dramatically altered exchange flow paths. However, the extensive hyporheic zone was maintained throughout the reach. Less change was observed in the constrained stream reach where both the depth and area of sediment available to be reworked by the flood were limited by bedrock constraining the width of the valley floor. This flood dramatically changed the hyporheic zone at the three study sites and these physical changes are expected to be biologically important, considering the role of the hyporheic zone in stream ecosystem processes.Show less"
