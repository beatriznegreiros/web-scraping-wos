0,"Chu, Y",May 2019 ,Hydrologically connected and isolated floodplains in channelized streams: impacts on plant communities under a temperate monsoonal climate,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The aim of this study was to understand the changes of floodplain vegetation following the disruption of lateral connectivity from streams by levee construction under the temperate monsoonal conditions of South Korea. We compared the plant community structure and selected environmental variables in paired floodplains, one connected to the stream inside a levee and the other isolated by a levee. Cluster analysis of the vegetation identified ten plant communities and their associated indicator species. There were clear differences in communities between the connected floodplains and isolated floodplains. Pioneer and early-successional communities, which are resistant to flood disturbance, were found only in the connected floodplains. In contrast, diverse aquatic-macrophytic communities, adapted to long flood duration, and late-successional communities sensitive to flooding disturbance were found mainly in the isolated floodplains. -turnover was the main driver in species compositions in both types of floodplain. The isolated floodplains had a longer flood duration, and their soils had a finer texture, higher moisture content, and were more acidic compared tothe connected floodplains. Flood duration and topological elevation were identified as the most important environmental variables with respect to plant community composition. Our results suggest that reinstatement of lateral connectivity is necessary to restore the fluvial native vegetation in the isolated floodplains of a region with a monsoonal climate.Show less"
1,"Januchowski-Hartley, SR",Nov 1 2022 ,Supporting proactive planning for climate change adaptation and conservation using an attributed road-river structure dataset,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Freshwater species and their habitats, and transportation networks are at heightened risk from changing climate and are priorities for adaptation, with the sheer abundance and individuality of road-river structures compli-cating mitigation efforts. We present a new spatial dataset of road-river structures attributed as culverts, bridges, or fords, and use this along with data on gradient and stream order to estimate structure sensitivity and exposure in and out of special areas of conservation (SAC) and built-up areas to determine vulnerability to damage across river catchments in Wales, UK. We then assess hazard of flooding likelihood at the most vulnerable structures to determine those posing high risk of impact on roads and river-obligate species (fishes and mussels) whose persistence depends on aquatic habitat connectivity. Over 5% (624/11,680) of structures are high vulnerability and located where flooding hazard is highest, posing high risk of impact to roads and river-obligate species. We assess reliability of our approach through an on-ground survey in a river catchment supporting an SAC and more than 40% (n = 255) of high-risk structures, and show that of the subset surveyed > 50% had obvious physical degradation, streambank erosion, and scouring. Our findings help us to better understand which structures pose high-risk of impact to river-obligate species and humans with increased flooding likelihood.Show less"
2,"Zeng, YJ",2016 ,"Ecohydrological effects of stream-aquifer water interaction: a case study of the Heihe River basin, northwestern China",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"A scheme describing the process of stream-aquifer interaction was combined with the land model CLM4.5 to investigate the effects of stream water conveyance over riparian banks on ecological and hydrological processes. Two groups of simulations for five typical river cross sections in the middle reaches of the arid-zone Heihe River basin were conducted. The comparisons between the simulated results and the measurements from water wells, the FLUXNET station, and remote sensing data showed good performance of the coupled model. The simulated riparian groundwater table at a propagation distance of less than 1 km followed the intra-annual fluctuation of the river water level, and the correlation was excellent (R-2 = 0.9) between the river water level and the groundwater table at the distance 60 m from the river. The correlation rapidly decreased as distance increased. In response to the variability of the water table, soil moisture at deep layers also followed the variation of river water level all year, while soil moisture at the surface layer was more sensitive to the river water level in the drought season than in the wet season. With increased soil moisture, the average gross primary productivity and respiration of riparian vegetation within 300 m from the river in a typical section of the river increased by approximately 0.03 and 0.02 mg Ca m(-2) s(-1), respectively, in the growing season. Consequently, the net ecosystem exchange increased by approximately 0.01 mg C m(-2) s(-1), and the evapotranspiration increased by approximately 3 mm day(-1). Furthermore, the length of the growing season of riparian vegetation also increased by 2-3 months due to the sustaining water recharge from the river. Overall, the stream-aquifer water interaction plays an essential role in the controlling of riparian hydrological and ecological processes.Show less"
3,"Mulholland, PJ",May 1997 ,Evidence that hyporheic zones increase heterotrophic metabolism and phosphorus uptake in forest streams,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"We used nondisruptive, whole-stream methods to measure hydraulic characteristics, ecosystem metabolism, and phosphorus cycling in the west fork of Walker Branch (WE), Tennessee and in Hugh White Creek (HWC), North Carolina. Although similar in many of their hydrological and chemical characteristics, transient storage zone volume in HWC was relatively large (similar to 1.5 times that of the flowing water zone), whereas transient storage zone volume in WE was small (similar to 0.1 times that of the flowing water zone). Both streams were highly heterotrophic (gross primary production:total respiration ratios <0.1), although respiration rate was similar to 2.4 times greater in HWC than in WE. Phosphorus uptake rate was similar to 2.6 times, greater in HWC than in WE, and P uptake length was 5 times longer in WE than in HWC. Analysis of P-33:H-3 ratio profiles from (PO4)-P-33 and (H2O)-H-3 injection experiments indicated that P uptake within the transient storage zone accounted for similar to 43% of the total P uptake in HWC but was negligible in WE, explaining, in part, the difference in total P uptake rate between these streams. The higher rate of P uptake in the surface zone, shorter P uptake length, and larger ratio of P uptake:respiration in HWC compared with WE suggest that the microbial community in HWC exerts a greater demand for and has a greater affinity for streamwater P presumably as a result of a greater supply of labile organic matter and/or lower nutrient levels in HWC.Show less"
4,"Danner, EM",Dec 2012 ,River Temperature Forecasting: A Coupled-Modeling Framework for Management of River Habitat,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,"Humans have substantially altered the thermal regimes of freshwater habitats worldwide, with significant environmental consequences. There is a critical need for a comprehensive modeling framework for forecasting the downstream impacts of two of the most common anthropogenic structures that alter river water temperatures: 1) dams that selectively release water from thermally stratified reservoirs, and 2) power generating stations and industrial plants that use river water for once-through cooling. These facilities change the thermal dynamics of the downstream waters through a complex interaction of water release volume and temperature and the subsequent exchange with the environment downstream. In order to stay within the downstream temperature limits imposed by regulatory agencies, managers must monitor not just release volumes and temperatures, but also need to be able to forecast the thermal impacts of their day-to-day operations on habitat which may be hundreds of kilometers downstream. Here we describe a coupled modeling framework that links mesoscale weather and ecological models to generate inputs for a physically-based water temperature model for monitoring and forecasting river temperatures downstream from these facilities at fine spatiotemporal scales. We provide an example of how this modeling framework is being applied to a water allocation decision support system (DSS) for the management of Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed salmon species in the Sacramento River in California.Show less"
5,"Underwood, ZE",Feb 2016 ,"Population connectivity and genetic structure of burbot (Lota lota) populations in the Wind River Basin, Wyoming",HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Burbot (Lota lota) occur in the Wind River Basin in central Wyoming, USA, at the southwestern extreme of the species' native range in North America. The most stable and successful of these populations occur in six glacially carved mountain lakes on three different tributary streams and one large main stem impoundment (Boysen Reservoir) downstream from the tributary populations. Burbot are rarely found in connecting streams and rivers, which are relatively small and high gradient, with a variety of potential barriers to upstream movement of fish. We used high-throughput genomic sequence data for 11,197 SNPs to characterize the genetic diversity, population structure, and connectivity among burbot populations on the Wind River system. Fish from Boysen Reservoir and lower basin tributary populations were genetically differentiated from those in the upper basin tributary populations. In addition, fish within the same tributary streams fell within the same genetic clusters, suggesting there is movement of fish between lakes on the same tributaries but that populations within each tributary system are isolated and genetically distinct from other populations. Observed genetic differentiation corresponded to natural and anthropogenic barriers, highlighting the importance of barriers to fish population connectivity and gene flow in human-altered linked lake-stream habitats.Show less"
6,"Steffensen, KD",Jul 3 2014 ,Fish community response to floodplain inundation in a regulated river,JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,"Floodplain connectivity has been identified as an important element of river ecosystem function for enhancing biological productivity, yet most of the world's large rivers have been managed to reduce river-floodplain connectivity to protect human interests. Flow events in the Missouri River basin during the summers of 2010 and 2011 offered a unique opportunity to investigate the influence of floodplain connectivity on fish communities. The floods created aquatic habitats not generally available on the main stem and the magnitude and duration of the 2011 event have not occurred since the main-stem dams were closed. Therefore, the objectives were to: (1) document species use on available floodplain habitats and assess age-0 fish presence, (2) compare spatial and temporal distribution of fish species, and (3) evaluate fish community responses at different discharges. Age-0 fish dominated the fish community during the 2010 and 2011 floods, representing 90% and 94% of all fish collected each year. Species composition during the 2011 flood was different above and below the Platte and Missouri rivers confluence (ANOSIM; r = 0.211; p < 0.001) and between individual sites (r = 0.667; p < 0.001) but did not change temporally (r = 0.086; p = 0.244). Comparison of the age-0 fish community response to varying water levels also differed (r = 0.619; p = 0.038) annually. The effects of this flood on the fish community of the Missouri River initially appear to have been beneficial for the native fish community; however, continued research and evaluation will verify the flood's effects.Show less"
7,"Ruehl, C",Oct 30 2006 ,Differential gauging and tracer tests resolve seepage fluxes in a strongly-losing stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The Pajaro River, central coastal California, consistently loses 0.2-0.4 m(3)/s of discharge along an 11.42-km experimental reach late in the water year, when discharge is <= 4.5 m(3)/s. Channel toss occurs throughout this reach, but is greatest in magnitude near the bottom of the reach. Water isotopic data and other observations suggest that channel loss results mainly from streambed seepage, as opposed to evapotranspiration. If it occurs throughout the year, the channel loss along this short stream reach could contribute 6-13 x 10(6) m(3) Of annual aquifer recharge, or similar to 20-40% of current sustainable basin yield. We performed a series of tracer injections along this reach to determine if hydrologic exchange occurs within this strongly-losing stream. We found that during periods of high channel loss, there were also comparable storage exchange fluxes and lateral inflow of tracer-free water. Within upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, storage exchange fluxes are about 10 times greater than lateral inflow. The former are associated with the movement of water between the main channel and surface or subsurface storage zones. In this system, it is likely that the tatter are primarily associated with spatially- or temporally-long subsurface flow paths within the shallow streambed, as opposed to inflow of ground water from deeper in the basin. Along both upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, lateral inflow tends to increase as channel discharge decreases. In contrast, storage exchange fluxes increase with decreasing discharge along the upper parts of the reach, but decrease with decreasing discharge along the Lower parts. Gauging and tracer test results suggest that subsurface storage exchange and loss may occur simultaneously, and that the lateral inflow of tracer-free water can be caused by long-scale subsurface flow as well as ground water making its first appearance in the channel.

8,"Hubbard, KA",Nov 15 2010 ,Evaluating nitrate uptake in a Rocky Mountain stream using labelled N-15 and ambient nitrate chemistry,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Background aqueous chemistry and N-15(nitrate) tracer injection methods were used to calculate in-stream nitrate uptake metrics at Red Canyon Creek, a third-order stream in the Rocky Mountains in the state of Wyoming, United States. 'Net' nitrate uptake lengths, which reflect both nitrate uptake and regeneration, and 'gross' nitrate uptake lengths, which exclude re-mineralization, were quantified separately from background nitrate chemistry and N-15 labelling tracer data, respectively. Gross nitrate uptake lengths, from tracer injections of N-15 labelled nitrate, ranged from 502 to 3140 m. Net nitrate uptake lengths, from background nitrate chemistry downstream of a point source, ranged from 1170 to 4330 m. Diurnal changes in uptake lengths suggest the importance of nitrate utilization by autotrophs in the stream and benthic zone. The differences between net and gross nitrate uptake lengths along lower reaches of Red Canyon Creek allowed us to estimate the nitrate regeneration rate, which was 0.056-0.080 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) during the day and 0.0062-0.0083 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at night. Spatial patterns of streambed pore water chemistry indicate those areas of the hyporheic zone where denitrification was likely occurring. Permanent log dams generated stronger redox gradients in the hyporheic zone than areas with transient beaver dams. By combining isotopically labelled nitrate additions, estimates of uptake from background aqueous nitrate chemistry and characterization of redox conditions in the hyporheic zone, we were able to determine the nitrate regeneration rate and the redox processes responsible for nitrogen cycling in the hyporheic zone.

9,"Du, XZ",Feb 2022 ,Investigating the impacts of glacier melt on stream temperature in a cold-region watershed: Coupling a glacier melt model with a hydrological model,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Stream temperature is a significant indicator for biodiversity and ecosystem health of stream ecosystem. The impacts of glacier melt processes on stream temperature, such as the cooling effect, have not been explicitly considered in process-based models, which limit model capability in simulating stream temperature in glacierized cold regions. We coupled a temperature index-based glacier melt model with the SWAT equilibrium temperature model to overcome this limitation. The coupled model was tested and applied in the upper Athabasca River basin in western Canada to simulate daily streamflow and stream temperature. It showed a good performance for stream temperature simulation with percent bias (PBIAS) less than +/- 5% and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) values greater than 0.85. The impact of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature simulation was investigated by turning the melt model on and off. The results illustrate that the coupled model accurately reproduces the impacts of glacier melt by simulating higher streamflow and lower stream temperature during the melt season. In particular, the progressive reduction in the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature from headwater to downstream was well represented. Finally, the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature under climate change was assessed by the scenario simulations. This analysis revealed that an increase in glacier melt runoff in the near future would alleviate the average and peak stream temperature increase during the melt season, while a decrease in glacier melt runoff in the distant future would ultimately aggravate the stream temperature increase. Therefore, the impact of glacier melt runoff should be explicitly considered in process-based models to accurately model stream temperature and predict future climate change impact on the thermal regime in the glacierized watersheds. The model coupling framework developed in this study could be a useful tool for simulating stream temperature in glacierized watersheds.Show less"
10,"Glinska-Lewczuk, K",Jan 8 2009 ,Water quality dynamics of oxbow lakes in young glacial landscape of NE Poland in relation to their hydrological connectivity,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"In this paper, the functioning of floodplain lakes was documented on the basis of water quality and hydrological data in a postglacial river floodplain representative of the temperate climatic zone. Nine oxbow lakes in the middle section of the River Lyna floodplain located in north-eastern Poland were investigated. Three groups of oxbow lakes distinguished on the basis of hydrological connectivity and retention time (lotic, semi-lotic and lentic) showed significant spatial and temporal differences in chemical parameters of water and matter cycling in relation to water table fluctuations, sediment character and aquatic plant diversity. Lotic habitats had parameters similar to river water, in particular to EC, main cation and anion concentrations. When the connection to a river is maintained, oxbow lakes prolong their existence due to multiple exchanges of matter. Very short-term water retention in lotic habitats is not favorable for sedimentation of such particles as Ca or SO4, Na, K, Cl which are easily moved by river water. This is contrary to lentic (disconnected) water bodies, where retention time is incomparably longer and internal cycling limits ecosystem productivity. Disconnected oxbow lakes undergo the highest seasonal variations in nutrient availability related in summer to intensive development of free-floating phytocenoses that limit light and aeration conditions, whereas and in winter to long-term ice cover. The presented data indicate an important function of oxbow lakes that relies on the regulation of nutrient transfer towards rivers. The effectiveness of TIN withdrawal from lentic oxbow lakes is estimated as 75%, whereas and in other macroelements from 50% to 82%, when compared to the lotic type. The retention ability of natural riverine ecosystems should be considered in proper designs of created wetlands. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.Show less"
11,"Kurthen, AL",Oct 21 2020 ,"Metacommunity Structures of Macroinvertebrates and Diatoms in High Mountain Streams, Yunnan, China",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The metacommunity concept has received increasing interest in the past two decades. However, there has been limited research examining metacommunity structure of communities in high mountain streams. These ecosystems are often physically constrained and can display large environmental gradients within a relatively small spatial extent. Here, we examined metacommunity structures of stream organisms in a high mountain region, which is part of the Hengduan Mountains region in Southwest China. Macroinvertebrates and diatoms were collected from six streams in two opposite aspects of the same mountain with different connectivity between streams. On the west aspect, streams are tributaries of a river (i.e., river-connected) while streams flow into a lake (i.e., lake-connected) on the east aspect. We used Elements of Metacommunity Structure analysis to explore the metacommunity structuring of these two biological models. We also compared the contribution of dispersal and environmental filtering in structuring metacommunities by looking at Euclidean, network, topographic, and environmental distances. Communities of diatoms and macroinvertebrates were structured with clear turnover on both aspects. Further, diatom communities exhibited Clementsian structure on both aspects. Macroinvertebrates exhibited different metacommunity structures on the river-connected aspect (Quasi-Clementsian) and lake-connected aspect (Clementsian). Our results indicated that on the lake-connected aspect, environmental filtering had a stronger association with community dissimilarity than on the river-connected aspect for both macroinvertebrate and diatom communities. Diatom communities were more influenced by environmental filtering on the east aspect with weakened network connectivity compared with those on the west aspect. Our results also emphasized the potential effects of biotic interactions between macroinvertebrates and diatoms on shaping community structures of one other. Our study provides substantial elements to further understand metacommunity structure and highlights the necessity of future research to reveal the underlying mechanisms of community structuring in these remote ecosystems.Show less"
12,"Argent, DG",2009 ,Fish Assemblage Connectivity in the Monongahela River Basin,NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST,"Tributary and mainstem corridors represent important fish-connectivity avenues in large riverscapes. We evaluated the connectivity of 40 Monongahela River tributaries in southwestern Pennsylvania and their respective mainstem junctions using a variety of gears. Twelve tributaries were so fragmented by physical and water-quality impediments, comparisons could not be made. Among the 28 remaining tributaries, classified as adventitious (1(st)-3(rd) order) or ordered (4(th)-5(th) order), we evaluated fish communities using the Jaccard coefficient of similarity, a cluster analysis, and a Venn diagram. Adventitious tributaries shared 82% of their total faunal complement with ordered tributaries and 29% with the mainstem, while 70% of the ordered ichthyofauna was common to the mainstem. The ichthyofauna of the adventitious tributary network was more distinct and isolated from the mainstem than that of ordered tributaries. In fragmented riverscapes such as this, islands (tributaries) of biodiversity may warrant special protection.Show less"

In deciduous forest streams, fallen leaves form a large component of the total organic matter budget, and many leaves become buried within stream sediments. We examined the processing of buried leaves as compared with those at the surface, and the influence of subsurface hydrology on processing rates.2. Leaf packs were secured on the streambed surface or buried 10 cm deep in upwelling and downwelling reaches of a second-order stream in Michigan, U. S. A. Mass loss and invertebrate colonisation were measured from October to February.3. Leaves buried in upwelling reaches lost mass more slowly ( exponential decay coefficient, k = -0.0097) than did leaves from the other treatments (buried downwelling:) 0.017; surface upwelling:) 0.022; surface downwelling: -0.021).4. Initially, more invertebrates colonised surface leaf packs than buried packs. During the remainder of the study, however, hydrology had a greater effect on invertebrate abundance than did burial, as more invertebrates were found in packs in downwelling reaches than in upwelling reaches.5. Local subsurface hydrology and degree of burial, factors rarely considered in studies of detritus processing, can significantly influence mass loss and invertebrate colonisation of fallen leaves in streams. Furthermore, because of slower processing, subsurface zones may function as organic matter reservoirs that gradually 'spiral' carbon to downstream subsurface and surface habitats.Show less"

Side-arms connected to the main stem of the river are key areas for biogeochemical cycling in fluvial landscapes, exhibiting high rates of carbon processing.2. This work focused on quantifying autochthonous and allochthonous carbon pools and, thereby, on comparing transport and transformation processes in a restored side-arm system of the River Danube (Regelsbrunn). We established a carbon budget and quantified carbon processing from March to September 2003. In addition, data from previous studies during 1997 to 1999 were assessed.3. Gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration were estimated by diel oxygen time curves and an oxygen mass balance. Plankton primary production was determined to estimate its contribution to GPP under different hydrological conditions.4. Based on the degree of connectivity, three hydrological phases were differentiated. Most of the organic matter, dominated by allochthonous carbon, was transported in the main channel and through the side-arm during floods, while at intermediate and low flows (and thus connectivity), transformation processes became more important and autochthonous carbon dominated the carbon pool. The side-arm system functioned as a sink for particulate matter [total suspended solids and particulate organic carbon (POC)] and a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll-a.5. Autochthonous primary production of 4.2 t C day(-1) in the side-arm was equivalent to about 20% of the allochthonous inputs of 20 t C day(-1) (POC and DOC) entering the area at mean flow (1% of the discharge of the main channel). Pelagic photosynthesis was generally high at mean flow (1.3-3.8 g C m(-2) day(-1)), and contributed up to 90% of system productivity. During long stagnant periods at low discharge, the side-arm was controlled by biological processes and a shift from planktonic to benthic activity occurred (benthic primary production of 0.4-14 g C m(-2) day(-1)).6. The transformation of the organic matter that passes through the side-arm under different hydrological conditions, points to the importance of these subsystems in contributing autochthonous carbon to the food web of the main channel.Show less"
17,"Stoffels, RJ",Apr 2016 ,Dynamics of fish dispersal during river-floodplain connectivity and its implications for community assembly,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"In river-floodplain ecosystems, overbank flows interact with floodplain geomorphology to generate a network of transient inter-waterbody connections. Heterogeneity in the characteristics of these connections may interact with species-specific dispersal capacity to affect the maintenance of diversity and community assembly on the floodplain. We modelled the immigration and emigration rates of nine species of fish entering and leaving a large floodplain lake during a hydrological connection with the parent river. Dispersal rates were modelled as a continuous function of time-since-connection over 3 months, with the aim of testing for species-specific patterns in (a) the timing and magnitudes of lateral dispersal, and (b) the balance between total immigration into, and emigration from, the lake. Significant interspecific variation in the timing and magnitude of lateral dispersal was evident. Magnitude of lateral dispersal was not a function of local abundance for all species. Further, the balance between immigration to, and emigration from, the lake varied significantly across species, and over time within species. The immigration-emigration balance of a species was not related to its magnitude of lateral dispersal, but may be related to its behavioural and life-history traits. Spatial heterogeneity in the duration of inter-waterbody connections may interact with species-specific dispersal functions to shape assembly of floodplain communities. Accordingly, habitat heterogeneity among floodplain waterbodies is not strictly necessary for heterogeneity in fish community composition. These dynamics have implications for the maintenance of diversity in river-floodplain fish metacommunities under both natural and managed connectivity regimes.Show less"
18,"Drummond, JD",Jul 7 2015 ,"Microbial Transport, Retention, and Inactivation in Streams: A Combined Experimental and Stochastic Modeling Approach",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Long-term survival of pathogenic microorganisms in streams enables long-distance disease transmission In order to manage water-borne diseases more effectively we need to better predict how microbes behave in freshwater systems, particularly how they are transported downstream in rivers. Microbes continuously immobilize and resuspend during downstream transport owing to a variety of processes including gravitational settling, attachment to in-stream structures such as submerged macrophytes, and hyporheic exchange and filtration within underlying sediments. We developed a stochastic model to describe these microbial transport and retention processes in rivers that also accounts for microbial inactivation. We used the model to assess the transport, retention, and inactivation stream and the underlying streambed sediments as measured from multitracer injection experiments. The results demonstrate that the combination of laboratory experiments on sediment cores, stream reach-scale tracer experiments, and multiscale stochastic modeling improves assessment of microbial transport in streams. This study (1) demonstrates new observations of microbial dynamics in streams with improved data quality than prior studies, (2) advances a stochastic modeling framework to include microbial inactivation processes that we observed to be important in these streams, and (3) synthesizes new and existing data to evaluate seasonal dynamics.Show less"
19,"Scheel, K",Apr 2019 ,Understanding the Large-Scale Influence of Levees on Floodplain Connectivity Using a Hydrogeomorphic Approach,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"The widespread construction of levees has reduced river-floodplain connectivity and altered associated fluvial processes in many river systems. Despite the recognition that levees can alter floodplain connectivity, few studies have examined the role of levees in reducing floodplain areas at large watershed scales. This paper explores the application of a hydrogeomorphic floodplain inundation model in the Wabash Basin, located in the Midwestern United States, to assess changes in floodplain area in levee-protected areas. We evaluate 10- and 30-m topographic resolutions and spatially examine the influence of levees on floodplain area in relation to river network attributes. Generally, floodplains in levee-protected areas were influenced by topographic resolution, stream order, and elevation details of levees found in topography datasets. We show, when compared to Federal Emergency Management Agency maps, our approach underpredicts floodplain area when using 10-m resolution topography data but only slightly overpredicts when using 30-m resolution data. After removing details of levees from topography data, we found changes in floodplain area varied spatially, but basin-aggregate results changed little compared to topography datasets that contain levees, though larger floodplain areas were produced in some regions where levees were removed. This work contributes to a growing research emphasis on using hydrogeomorphic floodplain models to understand floodplain disconnectivity.Show less"
20,"Armfield, JR",Mar 5 2019 ,Does Stream Water Composition at Sleepers River in Vermont Reflect Dynamic Changes in Soils During Recovery From Acidification?,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"Stream water pH and composition are widely used to monitor ongoing recovery from the deposition of strong anthropogenic acids in many forested headwater catchments in the northeastern United States. However, stream water composition is a function of highly complex and coupled processes, flowpaths, and variations in soil and bedrock composition. Spatial heterogeneity is especially pronounced in headwater catchments with steep topography, potentially limiting stream water composition as an indicator of changes in critical zone (CZ) dynamics during system recovery. To investigate the link between catchment characteristics, landscape position, and stream water composition we used long-term data (1991-2015) from the Sleepers River Research Watershed (SRRW) in northeastern Vermont. We investigated trends with time in stream water and trends with time, depth, and landscape position (upslope, midslope, and riparian zone) in groundwater (GW) and soil solution. We further determined soil elemental composition and mineralogy on archived (1996) and modern (2017) soil samples to assess changes in composition with time. SRRW is inherently well-buffered by calcite in bedrock and till, but soils had become acidified and are now recovering from acidification. Although base cations, especially Ca, decrease progressively with time in GW, riparian soils have become more enriched in Ca, due to a mixture of lateral and vertical transfers. At the same time stream water Ca fluxes increased over the past two decades, likely due to the leaching of (transient) legacy Ca from riparian zones and increased water fluxes. The stream water response therefore reflects the dynamic changes in soil chemistry, flow routing and water inputs.Show less"
21,"Burkhardt, P",Dec 2021 ,Graph Connectivity in Log Steps Using Label Propagation,PARALLEL PROCESSING LETTERS,"The fastest deterministic algorithms for connected components take logarithmic time and perform superlinear work on a Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM). These algorithms maintain a spanning forest by merging and compressing trees, which requires pointer-chasing operations that increase memory access latency and are limited to shared-memory systems. Many of these PRAM algorithms are also very complicated to implement. Another popular method is ""leader-contraction"" where the challenge is to select a constant fraction of leaders that are adjacent to a constant fraction of non-leaders with high probability, but this can require adding more edges than were in the original graph. Instead we investigate label propagation because it is deterministic, easy to implement, and does not rely on pointer-chasing. Label propagation exchanges representative labels within a component using simple graph traversal, but it is inherently difficult to complete in a sublinear number of steps. We are able to overcome the problems with label propagation for graph connectivity.We introduce a surprisingly simple framework for deterministic, undirected graph connectivity using label propagation that is easily adaptable to many computational models. It achieves logarithmic convergence independently of the number of processors and without increasing the edge count. We employ a novel method of propagating directed edges in alternating direction while performing minimum reduction on vertex labels. We present new algorithms in PRAM, Stream, and MapReduce. Given a simple, undirected graph G = (V,E) with n = vertical bar V vertical bar vertices, m = vertical bar E vertical bar edges, our approach takes O(m) work each step, but we can only prove logarithmic convergence on a path graph. It was conjectured by Liu and Tarjan (2019) to take O(log n) steps or possibly O(log(2) n) steps. Our experiments on a range of difficult graphs also suggest logarithmic convergence. We leave the proof of convergence as an open problem.Show less"
22,"Worman, A",Oct 1998 ,Analytical solution and timescale for transport of reacting solutes in rivers and streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A number of biogeochemical reactions and lateral hydro:dynamic mixing affects the transport of solute elements in streams and rivers. The combination of the various mechanisms gives rise to an accumulation of the solute in temporary storage zones and a retardation of solute migration. A new model framework is proposed from which an analytical solution is derived describing the concentration as a function of distance along the stream, depth into storage zones, and time. The model includes the effects of sorption of solutes to suspended solids and bed sediments, a lateral exchange with the storage zones, first-order reactions, and dilution. The migration velocity is close to the advection velocity of the stream for a short travel distance, but it continuously decreases as the distance increases. The timescale of the process is linearly related to a modified Damkohler number; a dimensionless form of the lateral exchange coefficient. The analytical solution has been verified for two tracer experiments with both a sorbing and a nonreactive tracer and the Cr transport in the Vistula River, Poland.

23,"Batzer, DP",Feb 2018 ,A Floodplain Continuum for Atlantic Coast Rivers of the Southeastern US: Predictable Changes in Floodplain Biota along a River's Length,WETLANDS,"Floodplains are among the world's economically-most-valuable, environmentally-most-threatened, and yet conceptually-least-understood ecosystems. Drawing on concepts from existing riverine and wetland models, and empirical data from floodplains of Atlantic Coast rivers in the Southeastern US (and elsewhere when possible), we introduce a conceptual model to explain a continuum of longitudinal variation in floodplain ecosystem functions with a particular focus on biotic change. Our hypothesis maintains that major controls on floodplain ecology are either external (ecotonal interactions with uplands or stream/river channels) or internal (wetland-specific functions), and the relative importance of these controls changes progressively from headwater to mid-river to lower-river floodplains. Inputs of water, sediments, nutrients, flora, and fauna from uplands-to-floodplains decrease, while the impacts of wetland biogeochemistry and obligate wetland plants and animals within-floodplains increase, along the length of a river floodplain. Inputs of water, sediment, nutrients, and fauna from river/stream channels to floodplains are greatest mid-river, and lower either up- or down-stream. While the floodplain continuum we develop is regional in scope, we review how aspects may apply more broadly. Management of coupled floodplain-river ecosystems would be improved by accounting for how factors controlling the floodplain ecosystem progressively change along longitudinal riverine gradients.Show less"

Currently, tracer techniques couple STS and HTS effects on stream nutrient cycling; however, STS resides in localized areas of the surface stream and HTS resides in the hyporheic zone. These contrasting environments result in different storage and exchange mechanisms with the surface stream, which can yield contrasting results when comparing transient storage effects among morphologically diverse streams. We propose a fluid mechanics approach to quantitatively separate STS from HTS that involves classifying and studying different types of STS. As a starting point, a classification scheme is needed. This paper introduces a classification scheme that categorizes different STS in riverine systems based on their flow structure. Eight STS types are identified and some are subcategorized based on characteristic mean flow structure: (1) lateral cavities (emergent and submerged); (2) protruding in-channel flow obstructions (backward-and forward-facing step); (3) isolated in-channel flow obstructions (emergent and submerged); (4) cascades and riffles; (5) aquatic vegetation (emergent and submerged); (6) pools (vertically submerged cavity, closed cavity, and recirculating reservoir); (7) meander bends; and (8) confluence of streams. The long-term goal is to use the classification scheme presented to develop predictive mean residence times for different STS using field-measurable hydromorphic parameters and obtain an effective STS mean residence time. The effective STS mean residence time can then be deconvolved from the transient storage residence time distribution (measured from a tracer test) to obtain an estimate of HTS mean residence time.Show less"
26,"Bustillos, S",Dec 10 2020 ,Implementation of Ion Exchange Processes for Carbon Dioxide Mineralization Using Industrial Waste Streams,FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH,"Sequestration of CO2 within stable mineral carbonates (e.g., CaCO3) represents an attractive emission reduction strategy because it offers a leakage-free alternative to geological storage of CO2 in an environmentally benign form. However, the pH of aqueous streams equilibrated with gaseous streams containing CO2 (pH < 4) are typically lower than that which is required for carbonate precipitation (pH > 8). Traditionally, alkalinity is provided by a stoichiometric reagent (e.g., NaOH) which renders these processes environmentally hazardous and economically unfeasible. This work investigates the use of regenerable ion-exchange materials to induce alkalinity in CO2-saturated aqueous solutions such that the pH shift required for mineralization occurs without the need for stoichiometric reagents. Na+-H+ exchange isotherms (at [H+] = 10(-8)-10(-1) M) and rates were measured for 13X and 4A zeolites and TP-207 and TP-260 organic exchange resins in batch equilibrium and fixed-bed exchange experiments, respectively. At solutions equilibrated with CO2 at 1.0 atm (pH = 3.9), H+ exchange capacities for the materials were similar (1.7-2.4 mmol H+/g material) and resulted in pH increases from 3.9 to greater than 8.0. Multi-component mixtures using Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations (at 10(-3)-10(-1) M) in CO2-saturated water were used to probe competitive ion exchange. The presence of divalent cations in solution inhibited H+ exchange, reducing capacities to as low as 0.2 mmol H+/g for both resins and zeolites. Dynamic H+ exchange capacities in fixed-bed ion exchange columns were similar to equilibrium values for resins (similar to 1.5 mmol/g) and zeolites (similar to 0.8 mmol/g) using inlet solutions that were equilibrated with gaseous streams of CO2 at 1.0 atm. However, exchange kinetics were limited by intraparticle diffusion as indicated by the increased rate parameters with increasing inlet flow rates (20-160 cm(3) min(-1)). Experimental calcite precipitation from mixing the alkaline CO32--rich water solution obtained from the ion-exchange column with a simulated liquid waste stream solution achieved thermodynamic maximum yields. The results from these studies indicate that ion exchange processes can be used as an alternative to the addition of stoichiometric bases to induce alkalinity for the precipitation of CaCO3, thereby opening a pathway toward sustainable and economic mineralization processes.Show less"
27,"Bravo, JM",May 2012 ,Coupled Hydrologic-Hydraulic Modeling of the Upper Paraguay River Basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"This paper presents a detailed modeling of rainfall-runoff processes and flow routing along a complex large-scale region, the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB), encompassing a drainage area of approximately 600; 000 km(2), which extends over Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Within the UPRB lies the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland, with extraordinary biodiversity and great ecologic value, but which currently is threatened by anthropogenic activities. A conceptual model was applied with two main components: (1) simulation of the basin and part of the Paraguay River tributaries by means of the distributed large-scale hydrological model MGB-IPH using simpler flow routing methods; and (2) simulation of the main drainage network, approximately 4,800 km of river reaches, with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Despite the data scarcity, complexity, and the intricate river drainage network of the region, the coupled model was able to represent the hydrological regime of the basin. Comparisons between observed and calculated hydrographs showed a good model skill in representing the flow regime of the upper Paraguay River and its tributaries, highlighting its value as a tool for understanding and predicting the system behavior. The proposed modeling of the hydrological processes of the UPRB, with a detail never presented before, provides a valuable tool for understanding ecosystem functioning and assessing its resilience to anthropogenic pressure, climate change, and climate variability.

28,"Lindgren, GA",Mar 18 2004 ,Solute transport through the integrated groundwater-stream system of a catchment,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] We present a coupled groundwater-stream model of catchment-scale solute transport, using a Lagrangian stochastic advective-sorptive travel time approach. We consider distributed solute input over an entire catchment and investigate the resulting stream solute breakthrough, subject to the possible solute spreading mechanisms: (1) variable groundwater advection and solute mass transfer between mobile and immobile groundwater zones and (2) in-stream advection, mixing, and solute mass transfer between stream water and hyporheic zone. Among these mechanisms we show that fractal solute spreading over a wide timescale range is, for realistic parameter values, obtained in the stream only for the condition combination of both variable solute advection and solute mass transfer in the groundwater, with mean groundwater advection to mass transfer rate ratio that falls within a certain value range and with only a small fraction of solute input mass following fast overland and/or storm soil water flow to the stream.Show less"

To address the research gap, this study quantified heat exchanges at the water surface and bed of the Taillon glacier-fed stream, French Pyrenees. Hydro-meteorological observations were recorded at 15-min intervals across two summer melt seasons (2010 and 2011), and energy balance components were measured or estimated based on site-specific data. Averaged over both seasons, net radiation was the largest heat source (similar to 80% of total flux); sensible heat (similar to 13%) and friction (similar to 3%) were also sources, while heat exchange across the channel-streambed interface was negligible (<1%). Latent heat displayed distinct interannual variability and contributed 5% in 2010 compared with 0.03% in 2011. At the sub-seasonal scale, latent heat shifted from source to sink, possibly linked to the retreating valley snowline that changed temperature and humidity gradients. These findings represent the first, multiyear study of the heat exchange processes operating in a glacier-fed stream, providing fundamental process understanding; the research highlights the direct control antecedent (winter) conditions that have on energy exchange and stream temperature during summer months. In particular, the timing and volume of snowfall/snowmelt can drive thermal dynamics by the following: (1) altering the length of the stream network exposed to the atmosphere and (2) controlling the volume and timing of cold water advection downstream. Finally, this study highlights the need to develop long-term hydro-meteorological monitoring stations to improve the understanding of these highly dynamic, climatically sensitive systems.

An integrated coastal modeling framework that incorporates both the natural and human components of these communities, and their interactions with both pulse and press stressors, is needed to help improve our understanding of coastal resilience. However, studying the coastal communities using a coupled natural-human system (CNH) approach is difficult. This paper presents a CNH modeling framework to analyze coastal resilience. We first describe such a CNH modeling framework through a case study of the Lower Mississippi River Delta in coastal Louisiana, USA. Persistent land loss and associated population decrease in the study region, a result of interplays between human and natural factors, are a serious threat to the sustainability of the region. Then, the paper describes the methods and findings of three studies on how community resilience of the MRD system is measured, how land loss is modeled using an artificial neural network-cellular automata approach, and how a system dynamic modeling approach is used to simulate population change in the region. The paper concludes by highlighting lessons learned from these studies and suggesting the path forward for analysis of coupled natural-human systems.Show less"

33,"Lynch, HJ",May 21 2011 ,How restructuring river connectivity changes freshwater fish biodiversity and biogeography,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Interbasin water transfer projects, in which river connectivity is restructured via man-made canals, are an increasingly popular solution to address the spatial mismatch between supply and demand of fresh water. However, the ecological consequences of such restructuring remain largely unexplored, and there are no general theoretical guidelines from which to derive these expectations. River systems provide excellent opportunities to explore how network connectivity shapes habitat occupancy, community dynamics, and biogeographic patterns. We apply a neutral model (which assumes competitive equivalence among species within a stochastic framework) to an empirically derived river network to explore how proposed changes in network connectivity may impact patterns of freshwater fish biodiversity. Without predicting the responses of individual extant species, we find the addition of canals connecting hydrologically isolated river basins facilitates the spread of common species and increases average local species richness without changing the total species richness of the system. These impacts are sensitive to the parameters controlling the spatial scale of fish dispersal, with increased dispersal affording more opportunities for biotic restructuring at the community and landscape scales. Connections between isolated basins have a much larger effect on local species richness than those connecting reaches within a river basin, even when those within-basin reaches are far apart. As a result, interbasin canal projects have the potential for long-term impacts to continental-scale riverine communities.Show less"
34,"Miralha, L",Jan 2023 ,Characterizing stream temperature hysteresis in forested headwater streams,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream temperature (T-s) is a key water quality parameter that controls several biological, ecological, and chemical processes in aquatic systems. In forested headwaters, exchanges of energy across air-water-streambed interfaces may influence T-s regimes, especially during storm events as the sources of runoff change over space and time. Analysis of the hysteretic behaviour of T-s during storm events may provide insights into rainfall-runoff responses, but such relationships have not been thoroughly investigated. As such, our objectives were to (a) quantify the variability of stream temperature hysteresis across seasons in different sub-regions and (b) investigate the relationship between the hysteretic response and catchment characteristics. T-s hysteresis during storm events was assessed based on the hysteresis index (HI), which describes the directionality of hysteresis loops, and the temperature response index (TRI), which indicates whether T-s increased or decreased during a storm event. We analysed T-s data from 10 forested headwater reaches in two sub-regions (McGarvey and West Fork Tectah) in Northern California. We also performed a clustering analysis to examine the relationship amongst HI, TRI, topographic metrics, and meteorological characteristics of the study areas. Overall, the hysteretic behaviour of T-s varied across seasons-the greatest HI occurred during spring and summer. Interestingly, in the McGarvey streams the variability in T-s hysteresis co-varied strongly with topographic metrics (i.e., upslope accumulative area, average channel slope, topographic wetness index). Comparatively, in West Fork Tectah the variability of T-s hysteresis co-varied most strongly with meteorological metrics (i.e., antecedent rainfall events, solar radiation, and air temperature). Variables such as the gradient between stream and air temperatures, slope, and wetted width were significant for both sub-regional hysteretic patterns. We posit that the drivers of T-s response during storms are likely dependent on catchment physiographic characteristics. Our study also illustrated the potential utility of stream temperature as a tracer for improving the understanding of hydrologic connectivity and shifts in the dominant runoff contributions to streamflow during storm events.Show less"

In order to understand surface water-groundwater interactions at the scale of the distributary channel network, we created three numerical deltas that ranged in composition from silt to sand using Delft3D, a morphodynamic flow and sediment transport model. We then linked models of mean annual river discharge to steady groundwater flow in MODFLOW. Under mean annual discharge, exchange rates through the numerical deltas are enhanced relative to a single-threaded river. We calculate that exchange rates across a < 10 km(2) network are equivalent to exchange through similar to 10-100 km of single-threaded river channel. Exchange rates are greatest in the coarse-grained delta due to its permeability and morphology. Groundwater residence times range from hours to centuries and have fractal tails. Deltas are vanishing due to relative sea level rise. River diversion projects aimed at creating new deltaic land should also aim to restore surface water-groundwater connectivity, which is critical for biogeochemical processing in wetlands. We recommend designing diversions to capture more sand and thus maximize surface water-groundwater connectivity.Show less"
36,"Sandercock, PJ",Apr 2007 ,Vegetation tin dryland river channels and its interaction with fluvial processes,PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY,"Vegetation forms a major component of the channel environment of dryland rivers in Mediterranean Europe yet the interactions between vegetation and fluvial processes in dryland river channels have received relatively little attention. Characteristic of dryland channels is a degree of complexity and irregularity in morphology coupled with abrupt changes in patterns of riparian vegetation along their course. This is in contrast to more temperate and humid channels, which show strong downstream trends in morphology and a regularity in the distribution of vegetation across the valley floor. The general effect of vegetation in these channels appears to be to enhance the processes of sedimentation and increase resistance to erosion. However, at high stress levels vegetation may be removed. The limited work that has been undertaken indicates that there is considerable variability in the effect that vegetation has on channel processes, depending on both the magnitude of the flow and characteristics of the vegetation, such as their distribution and positioning within the channel and factors such as plant flexibility, cross-sectional area (blockage ratio), number of stems. Studies of sediment connectivity are beginning to yield new insights into the dynamics of dryland rivers, and in particular the role of vegetation in reducing the connectivity of sediment transfers downstream. Detailed surveying at monitored sites such as is being carried out within the EU-funded project RECONDES is required to study the interactions between vegetation, sediment and flow in dryland rivers of the Mediterranean region.Show less"
37,"Mohamed, RAM",Dec 2021 ,Comparison of fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing and high-sensitivity sensor spatial surveying of stream temperature,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Measuring surface water temperature spatial variability is needed to estimate the interaction between surface water and groundwater, evaluate fish habitat and thermal inertia, and to estimate streamflow frequency and duration. Fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) has been used in rivers and lakes, providing high-resolution and sensitive temperature monitoring over large temporal and spatial scales. However, in streams with cobbly or bedrock-lined streambeds and variable bathymetry, use of FO-DTS to measure temperature close to the surface water and groundwater interface can be challenging if even feasible. FO-DTS can also be costly, involve difficult installations, and require an advanced understanding of the technology, calibration, and data processing. In this study, we compared FO-DTS stream temperature survey results to an alternative temperature survey method employing a towed transect of high-resolution temperature loggers spaced at 1-m and transported in the stream along the study reach, to measure the spatial distribution of stream-water temperature in East Fork Poplar Creek near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. We assessed the applicability and limitations of the two methods, and quantitatively compared in-situ temperature survey results measured simultaneously with each method. Regression results showed strong temporal and spatial correlation between the two methods. Differences were only elevated near the stream banks in areas that were coincident with correlation slope deviations from unity, which was attributed to shallower water and lower data density. Kriging standard errors were also low at channel center with minor increases near the stream banks. The results suggested that the array of the individual temperature sensors can provide a practical alternative to FO-DTS for thermal characterization of surface water, providing slightly lower spatial and temporal resolution, but with higher accuracy of temperature measurement, with greater simplicity, and with a broader range of conditions where it may be applied.Show less"
38,"De Jager, NR",Feb 2012 ,"Spatial patterns of aquatic habitat richness in the Upper Mississippi River floodplain, USA",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Interactions among hydrology and geomorphology create shifting mosaics of aquatic habitat patches in large river floodplains (e.g., main and side channels, floodplain lakes, and shallow backwater areas) and the connectivity among these habitat patches underpins high levels of biotic diversity and productivity. However, the diversity and connectivity among the habitats of most floodplain rivers have been negatively impacted by hydrologic and structural modifications that support commercial navigation and control flooding. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the rate of increase in patch richness (# of types) with increasing scale reflects anthropogenic modifications to habitat diversity and connectivity in a large floodplain river, the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). To do this, we calculated the number of aquatic habitat patch types within neighborhoods surrounding each of the approximate to 19 million 5-m aquatic pixels of the UMR for multiple neighborhood sizes (1-100 ha). For all of the 87 river-reach focal areas we examined, changes in habitat richness (R) with increasing neighborhood length (L, # pixels) were characterized by a fractal-like power function R = L-2 (R-2 > 0.92 (P < 0.05)). The scaling exponent (z) measures the rate of increase in habitat richness with neighborhood size and is related to a fractal dimension. Variation in z reflected fundamental changes to spatial patterns of aquatic habitat richness in this river system. With only a few exceptions, z exceeded the river-wide average of 0.18 in focal areas where side channels, contiguous floodplain lakes, and contiguous shallow-water areas exceeded 5%, 5%, and 10% of the floodplain respectively. In contrast, z was always less than 0.18 for focal areas where impounded water exceeded 40% of floodplain area. Our results suggest that rehabilitation efforts that target areas with <5% of the floodplain in side channels, <5% in floodplain lakes, and/or <10% in shallow-water areas could improve habitat diversity across multiple scales in the UMR.

39,"Mignot, E",Jun 2017 ,Measurement of mass exchange processes and coefficients in a simplified open-channel lateral cavity connected to a main stream,ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS,"Lateral cavities are major storage zones in riverine environments for which the mass exchanges with the main stream strongly impact the characteristics of the habitat in these dead zones. An experimental work is presented here with a controlled main stream and a connected open-channel lateral cavity to assess the processes responsible for these exchanges and to quantify the exchange capacities. In a first step, the measurements of passive scalar transport allow us to identify the physical processes involved in the exchange of mass from the main stream and its spreading within the cavity. In a second step, the quantitative mass exchange coefficient, representative of the exchange capacity, is measured for 28 flow and cavity configurations. The sensibility analysis to the governing parameters proposed by the dimensional analysis then reveals that changing the geometric aspect ratio of the cavity does not affect the exchange coefficient while increasing the normalized water depth or decreasing the Reynolds number of the main stream tend to increase this coefficient. Indeed, these parameters modify both the growth rate of the mixing layer width at the interface and the amplitude of the alternating transverse velocity across the interface, thus affecting the exchange capacities from the main stream to the cavity.Show less"
40,"Jamieson, TS",Feb 1 2013 ,"Using stable isotopes of dissolved oxygen for the determination of gas exchange in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada",WATER RESEARCH,"Gas exchange can be a key component of the dissolved oxygen (DO) mass balance in aquatic ecosystems. Quantification of gas transfer rates is essential for the estimation of DO production and consumption rates, and determination of assimilation capacities of systems receiving organic inputs. Currently, the accurate determination of gas transfer rate is a topic of debate in DO modeling, and there are a wide variety of approaches that have been proposed in the literature. The current study investigates the use of repeated measures of stable isotopes of O-2 and DO and a dynamic dual mass-balance model to quantify gas transfer coefficients (k) in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. Measurements were conducted over a longitudinal gradient that reflected watershed changes from agricultural to urban. Values of k in the Grand River ranged from 3.6 to 8.6 day(-1), over discharges ranging from 5.6 to 22.4 m(3) s(-1), with one high-flow event of 73.1 m(3) s(-1). The k values were relatively constant over the range of discharge conditions studied. The range in discharge observed in this study is generally representative of non-storm and summer low-flow events; a greater range in k might be observed under a wider range of hydrologic conditions. Overall, k values obtained with the dual model for the Grand River were found to be lower than predicted by the traditional approaches evaluated, highlighting the importance of determining site-specific values of k. The dual mass balance approach provides a more constrained estimate of k than using DO only, and is applicable to large rivers where other approaches would be difficult to use. The addition of an isotopic mass balance provides for a corroboration of the input parameter estimates between the two balances. Constraining the range of potential input values allows for a direct estimate of k in large, productive systems where other k-estimation approaches may be uncertain or logistically infeasible.

High-quality development requires maintaining a healthy and cyclical approach to economic development, which is a challenge in the original development approach. Yet, a great deal of evidence suggests that there is a strong interrelationship between economic development and the ecological environment, and developing a method to quantify this interrelationship is important for studying the extent of high-quality development. Here, we propose a new indicator system using the coupling degree model and the coupling coordination degree model to assess the coupled coordination of economic development and the ecological environment in the Yellow River basin as a whole and in each province. We found that: (1) the economic development and ecological health of the Yellow River basin exhibit a slowly increasing trend; (2) the coupling degree of the economic development and ecological environment is high, indicating that the interaction between the economy and ecology is very strong; and (3) the increasing degree of coupling and coordination reflects the trend of continuous improvement and coordination in the relationship between the economy and ecological environment, and the level of high-quality development in the basin has continuously increased. The results of this study indicate that to continue to strengthen the high-quality development in the Yellow River basin, the contradiction between the economy and ecology should be alleviated, and coordinated development of both should be achieved.Show less"
42,"Knosche, R",May 2006 ,"Organic sediment nutrient concentrations and their relationship with the hydrological connectivity of floodplain waters (River Havel, NE Germany)",HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Investigations on large canalised rivers, for example the Danube, have shown that transported particulate matter, which is typically inorganic, is predominantly deposited in waters near the river's main channel. This investigation deals with the lower section of the River Havel (NE Germany), a canalised lowland river with a very flat floodplain. This river is highly polluted by nutrients from urban areas (Berlin) and a long chain of river lakes produces high concentrations of phytoplankton. Due to the high proportion of planktogenic detritus, it was hypothesised that greater quantities of nutrient-rich fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) would be deposited in floodplain waters located further from the main channel than has been reported for large rivers. The total nutrient, P-binding metal (Fe, Al, and Mn), organic and inorganic carbon (TOC, TIC) contents of the upper organic sediment layer (0-4 cm) were analysed in samples collected from 48 floodplain water and river sites. The sediment bulk density, calculated on the basis of dry mass content and loss on ignition, was used to characterise the waters according to the impact of the river current. The results showed that the variability of total phosphorus (TP) was best explained by the variability of total iron (TFe, R-2 = 0.52). The floodplain water sediments could clearly be separated into two groups on the basis of the sediment particle size composition, and of the element ratios TOC:TP, TN:TP, primarily TFe:TP. The sediments from impounded river sections and from mouth sections of backwaters (approx. 100-200 m) were characterised by a high proportion particles from the 0.1 to 0.5 mm size fraction and by homogeneous, low TFe:TP, TOC:TP and TN:TP ratios. Sediments from distal sections of backwaters and of oxbow lakes tended to exhibit high element ratios with much higher variability. These results were interpreted as a spatially limited impact of the river on the floodplain water sediments. Contrary to expectation, the phosphorus bound in river seston was predominantly and very homogeneously deposited in the impounded river and mouth sections of backwaters. This implies that the inundation of the floodplain waters during spring floods seems to have no important material impact on the sediments in waters of low hydrological connectivity with the River Havel.Show less"
43,"Boswell, SM",May 15 2018 ,Continental-scale transport of sediments by the Baltic Ice Stream elucidated by coupled grain size and Nd provenance analyses,EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS,"We introduce a methodology for determining the transport distance of subglacially comminuted and entrained sediments. We pilot this method on sediments from the terminal margin of the Baltic Ice Stream, the largest ice stream of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum. A strong correlation (R-2 = 0.83) between the epsilon Nd and latitudes of circum-Baltic river sediments enables us to use epsilon Nd as a calibrated measure of distance. The proportion of subglacially transported sediments in a sample is estimated from grain size ratios in the silt fraction (<63 mu m). Coupled epsilon Nd and grain size analyses reveal a common erosion source for the Baltic Ice Stream sediments located near the Aland sill, more than 850 km upstream from the terminal moraines. This result is in agreement with both numerical modeling and geomorphological investigations of Fennoscandinavian erosion, and is consistent with rapid ice flow into the Baltic basins prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The methodology introduced here could be used to infer the distances of glacigenic sediment transport from Late Pleistocene and earlier glaciations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

44,"Eekhout, JPC",Jul 2015 ,Morphological assessment of reconstructed lowland streams in the Netherlands,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Channelisation measures taken halfway the 20th century have had destructive consequences for the diversity of the ecology in the majority of the lowland streams in countries such as the Netherlands. Re-meandering is the common practice in restoring these lowland streams. Three reconstructed streams were monitored during the initial two years after construction of a new channel. The monitoring program included morphological surveys, sediment sampling, habitat pattern surveys, and discharge and water level measurements. Adjustments of the longitudinal bed profile formed the main morphological response. These adjustments were most likely caused by a lack of longitudinal connectivity of the streams as a whole, interrupting transport of sediment at locations of weirs and culverts. Bank erosion was observed only in a limited number of channel bends, and was often related to floodplain heterogeneity. Longitudinal channel bed adjustments and bank erosion were mainly caused by exogenous influences. In channel bends, the cross-sectional shape transformed from trapezoidal to the typical asymmetrical shape as found in meandering rivers. This behaviour can be attributed to an autogenous response to the prevailing flow conditions. Due to the prevailing fine sediment characteristics, bed material is readily set in motion and is being transported during the entire year. The existing design principles fail to address the initial morphological development after reconstruction. An evaluation of pre-set targets to realise water depth and flow velocity ranges shows the current procedures to be deficient. Based on this unfavourable evaluation, and the two-dimensional nature of habitat patterns needed to improve the conditions for stream organisms, we recommend to predict morphological developments as part of the design procedures for lowland stream restoration in the Netherlands.

Glacial landforms and stochastic mass wasting in alpine systems may interfere with sediment delivery to downstream sites where detrital sediments are often collected to represent upstream bedrock sources. To use detrital sediments as indicators of erosion, we need to understand potential sediment accumulation in flat glaciated reaches or behind rockfall barriers. This study investigates the stream channel in Garnet Canyon, a glaciated catchment located in the central Teton Range, to describe hillslope coupled channel morphology and the subsequent effects on sediment transport throughout the catchment. Stream cross-section surveys and sediment size measurements of the surface bedload were collected in the field within a glacially flattened segment of Garnet Canyon. Calculations of shear stress conditions allowed evaluation of the importance of mineral densities on potential grain entrainment. The length of the Garnet Canyon stream observed in this study was coupled with hillslope deposits. Critical shear stresses were sufficient to move gravel-sized sediments through all sections when calculated with quartz mineral density and through most sections when applying apatite mineral density. These results verify the application of detrital sediments to evaluate erosion rates or spatial bedrock sources because snowmelt stream flow efficiently moves entrained sediment past glacially reduced slopes and potential talus barriers.

Sedimentary research that is needed to inform restoration projects has so far focused on characterizing flow patterns through forests associated with single rivers, nearshore environments, or terminating tidal channels. However, flows within the most extensive mangrove forests tend to be driven through channels that connect to multiple estuaries or other channels with temporally lagged tides. For this study, in-situ observations of water and sediment flux were obtained in two tidal channels near the Amazon River to characterize how connectivity impacts sediment transport in coastal mangrove forests. The low-connectivity channel connects to one estuary whereas the high-connectivity channel connects two estuaries. We conclude that channel connectivity controls the amount of sediment stored in channels that is available to supply mangrove forests. Although phase-duration asymmetry is flood dominant in both channels, velocity asymmetry becomes ebb dominant during tidal cycles when the mangrove flats are inundated. Additionally, tidal elevation and water velocity are not in quadrature for the high-connectivity channel, as they are for the low-connectivity channel. As a result, the high-connectivity channel acts as a conduit for sediment from one estuary to another rather than simply importing and retaining sediment like the low-connectivity channel. High-connectivity channels distribute point-source sediment along coastlines and provide sediment to estuaries and channels that may not have their own direct source. As restoration efforts of mangrove forests continue to grow in response to coastal threats such as sea-level rise and diminished fluvial-sediment delivery, the location of these efforts can benefit from the conclusion that channel connectivity influences spatial dispersal of sediment supply to mangrove forests.Show less"
47,"Gao, F",Mar 14 2019 ,Assessment of Surface Water Resources in the Big Sunflower River Watershed Using Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW Model,WATER,"The groundwater level in the Big Sunflower River Watershed (BSRW) in the U.S. has declined significantly in the past 30 years. Therefore, it is imperative to assess surface water resources (SWR) availability in BSRW to mitigate groundwater use for irrigation. This research applied the coupled Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Modular Groundwater Flow model (SWAT-MODFLOW) to assess SWR in BSRW. This study aimed at: (1) Assessing the reliability of SWAT-MODFLOW in BSRW, (2) analyzing temporal and spatial variations of SWR, and (3) assessing the potential availability of SWR in BSRW. Calibration and validation results showed that SWAT-MODFLOW can well simulate streamflow and groundwater levels in BSRW. Our results showed that BSRW had lower average monthly total stream resources (MSR = 8.8 x 10(7) m(3)) in growing seasons than in non-growing seasons (MSR = 11.0 x 10(7) m(3)), and monthly pond resources (MPR from 30,418 to 30,494 m(3)) varied less than stream resources. The proportion of sub-basins in BSRW with stream water resources greater than 700 mm was 21% in dry years (229 to 994 mm), while this increased to 35% in normal years (296 to 1141 mm) and 57% in wet years (554 to 991 mm). The Water Stress Index (WSI) ranged from 0.4 to 2.1, revealing that most of the sub-basins in BSRW have net SWR available for irrigation. Our results suggested that surface water resources might be supplementary irrigation sources to mitigate the water resources scarcity in this region.Show less"
48,"Datry, T",Aug 2016 ,"Challenges, developments and perspectives in intermittent river ecology",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Although more than half the world's river networks comprise channels that periodically cease to flow and dry [intermittent rivers (IRs)], river ecology was largely developed from and for perennial systems. Ecological knowledge of IRs is rapidly increasing, so there is a need to synthesise this knowledge and deepen ecological understanding. In this Special Issue, we bring together 13 papers spanning observational case studies, field and laboratory experiments and reviews to guide research and management in this productive field of freshwater science. We summarise new developments in IR ecology, identify research gaps and needs, and address how the study of IRs as highly dynamic ecosystems informs ecological understanding more broadly. This series of articles reveals that contemporary IR ecology is a multifaceted and maturing field of research at the interface between aquatic and terrestrial ecology. This research contributes to fresh water and general ecology by testing concepts across a range of topics, including disturbance ecology, metacommunity ecology and coupled aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. Drying affects flow continuity through time and flow connectivity across longitudinal, lateral and vertical dimensions of space, which aligns well with the recent emphasis of mainstream ecology on meta-system perspectives. Although most articles here focus on the wet phase, there is growing interest in dry phases, and in the terrestrial vegetation and invertebrate assemblages living in and along IR channels. We encourage interdisciplinary studies on IRs to further blur the demarcation between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and develop more integrated perspectives. As a result of climate change and human modification of landscapes and waterways, flooding and drought are expected to become more extreme and widespread. Shifts in streamflow regimes from perennial to intermittent may exacerbate the duration and frequency of dry phases in IRs with serious implications for river ecosystems and the quality and diversity of services they provide.Show less"
49,"Wang, W",Dec 26 2022 ,"Abandonment of ancient cities near the Salawusu River valley, China, triggered by stream capture",COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,"Several cities in the Salawusu River basin in the western Mu Su Desert of China were abandoned after the Yuan Dynasty (1271 to 1368 CE). Incisions of rivers caused by earth uplift coupled with a drier climate after the Yuan Dynasty have previously been attributed to such irreversible abandonments. Here we use geomorphological analyses, coupled with hydrological reconstructions to investigate the ancient stream patterns in the period leading up to the abandonments. We find that the abandonment of wells, the thermoluminescence age of which is about 640 years before present, in these cities coincided with a stream capture event that led to rapid river valley incision of up to 95 mm/year. We suggest that this stream piracy event lowered the water table in the area and triggered the abandonment of settlements, rather than a change to a drier climate as previously believed. We conclude that when considering environmental influences on archaeological records, geographic events must be considered in addition to climatic change.Show less"
