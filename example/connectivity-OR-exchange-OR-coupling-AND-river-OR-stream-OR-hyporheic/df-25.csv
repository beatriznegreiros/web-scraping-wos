0,"Dehkordy, FM",Jun 2019 ,Multi-scale preferential flow processes in an urban streambed under variable hydraulic conditions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Spatially preferential flow processes occur at nested scales at the sediment-water interface (SWI), due in part to sediment heterogeneities, which may be enhanced in flashy urban streams with heavy road sand influence. However, several factors, including the flow-rate dependence of preferential hyporheic flow and discrete groundwater discharge zones are commonly overlooked in reach-scale models of groundwater/surface water exchange. Using a series of controlled-head tracer-injection experiments coupled with cm-scale geophysics within the highly reactive upper 30 cm of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream, we quantified the flow dependence of local less-mobile porosity volume, mass-transfer rate coefficient, and the resulting local residence time in the less-mobile pore space at three controlled downward fluid fluxes (0.8, 2, and 3 m/d). Experiments were performed in two adjacent streambed locations, representing different sediment bulk vertical permeability. Less-mobile porosity parameters were generally substantial and similar between the two streambed locations; though a more competent, thin, organic layer at similar to 15 cm depth in one location strongly impacted tracer loading, flushing dynamics, and local residence times. Increased downward flux led to (1) a decrease in less-mobile porosity residence time in all experiments, and (2) an increase in less-mobile porosity fraction for most experiments. Additionally, at the larger stream reach-scale, surface electrodes for electrical resistivity measurement were installed along 22 m of the wetted stream channel. These surface electrode measurements were collected during a natural storm flow event, which revealed widespread, short-term, flushing (e.g. < 3 h) of the hyporheic zone with stream water, followed by longer-term (e.g. > 60 h) flushing of the SWI with riparian zone groundwater. Flow dependence of preferential hyporheic zone flowpaths, like in the controlled tracer experiments, was also observed in these reach-scale electrical resistivity tomography measurements. Our findings reveal that the spatial and temporal dependence of preferential flow processes create highly dynamic SWI conditions that will affect the physical and coupled biogeochemical functions of the SWI in urbanized, sand-impacted streams.Show less"
1,"Ping, X",Nov 2020 ,Effect of bioclogging on the nitrate source and sink function of a hyporheic zone,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Nitrogen dynamic in a hyporheic zone (HZ) is mediated by microbes in the form of biofilms attached to sediment grains. Previous studies have neglected the influence of microbial effects on hyporheic nitrate function despite the fact that biofilm-induced clogging can significantly reduce sediment permeability and affect both residence time distribution and biochemical reaction rates. In this study, to assess how the development of bioclogging affects the nitrate source and sink function of HZs, we established a numerical model by coupling water flow, reactive solute transport, and microbial metabolism to simulate nitrogen cycling in a dune-shaped streambed. The classic Damkohler number (Da(O2)) with an average reaction timescale was not appropriate to determine hyporheic function for the context of biofilm growth induced streambed permeability and biogeochemical reaction rates changing with time. We proposed a new Damkohler number (Da(O2)*) with a correction factor (the ratio between current bacteria and initial bacteria) to identify hyporheic function while accounting for the dynamic process of microbial growth. Our results demonstrated that bioclogging layers with aerobic bacteria aggregation acted as a nitrate source system with Da(O2)* >> 1, whereas deeper streambed with negligible microbiota survival severed as a nitrate sink with Da(O2)* < 1 when V-O2 = 1 h(-1). The threshold value of net nitrate source or sink system was influenced by maximum reaction rate of oxygen, and it was in a general range of 1-50 (the range of V-O2 was in 1-3 h(-1)). Threshold transition times from nitrate source to sink were evaluated from the spectrum of flow paths and had strong spatiotemporal variability due to microbial growth. The threshold times decreased over time and stabilized between 1.0 and 3.7 h (for V-O2 = 1 h(-1)) in a dune-shaped streambed when biofilm layers formed.Show less"
2,"Guillon, S",Feb 2019 ,Functional classification of artificial alluvial ponds driven by connectivity with the river: Consequences for restoration,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Chemical and biological functioning of artificial wetlands and lakes in alluvial plains is investigated based on the example of small artificial ponds located within dike fields along the Rhone River (France). The objective is to identify the diversity of metabolism in these artificial aquatic ecosystems and to propose a functional classification linked to the connectivity with the river. A comprehensive characterization of chemical and biological parameters in six shallow ponds was conducted, along with 4-month continuous monitoring of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration, both in the sub-surface and at depth. Metabolism intensity is quantified using the diel oxygen method. Multivariate analysis of chemical and biological characteristics is performed to identify the functional heterogeneity between the ponds, which is shown to be consistent with the intensity of primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). Some ponds are permanently connected to the river, like backwater, and are very turbid, because of suspended matter and the presence of phytoplankton. The oxygenation is limited to the surface layer with anoxia rapidly building up at the bottom due to an intense ER. Ponds that are rarely connected become eutrophic with large concentration of phytoplankton and large GPP and ER values. Anoxia and even denitrification occur close to the bottom sediment. Finally, in the ponds with intermediate degree of connection with the river, macrophytes grow in clear water with limited amount of phytoplankton, resulting in a gradient of GPP and ER values, controlled by nutrient availability. Rehabilitation of various connection patterns with the river is thus crucial to maintain a functional diversity in large river alluvial plains.Show less"
3,"Brinkerhoff, CB",Oct 2022 ,Remotely Sensing River Greenhouse Gas Exchange Velocity Using the SWOT Satellite,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,"Two decades of research has shown that the global river network emits significant amounts of greenhouse gas. Despite much progress, there is still large uncertainty in the temporal dynamics of gas exchange and thus carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Much of this uncertainty stems from a lack of existing tools for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of gas exchange velocity k600 ${k}_{600}$ (the rate of this diffusive transport). We propose that the NASA/CNES/UKSA/CSA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite can provide new insights to fluvial gas exchange modeling upon launch and subsequent data collection in 2022. Here, we exploit the distinct geomorphology of SWOT-observable rivers (>50 m wide) to develop a physical model of gas exchange that is remotely sensible and explains 50% of log-transformed variation across 166 field measurements of k600 ${k}_{600}$. We then couple this model with established inversion techniques to develop BIKER, the ""Bayesian Inference of the k600 ${k}_{600}$ Exchange Rate"" algorithm. We validate BIKER on 47 SWOT-simulated rivers without an in-situ calibration, yielding an algorithm that predicts the k600 ${k}_{600}$ timeseries solely from SWOT observations with a by-river median Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.21. BIKER is better at inferring the temporal variation of gas exchange (median correlation coefficient of 0.91), than reproducing the absolute rates of exchange (median normalized RMSE of 51%). Finally, BIKER is robust to measurement errors implicit in the SWOT data. We suggest that BIKER will be useful in mapping global-scale fluvial gas exchange and improving CO2 $\left[\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}\right]$ emissions estimates when coupled with river CO2 $\left[\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}\right]$ models.Show less"
4,"Dickson, NE",Sep 25 2012 ,Flow regulation alters alpine river thermal regimes,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Impacts of anthropogenic flow regulation on the thermal regimes of alpine river systems are poorly understood. This is surprising given the importance of water temperature for river ecosystems and the widespread regulation of mountain rivers across the world. This study examined water temperature dynamics year-round between July 2008 and September 2009 in the Eisboden river system, central Austrian Alps. Water temperature data were examined alongside hydroclimatological data to infer the key processes driving thermal variability from diurnal to inter-annual scales. As expected, interactions between meteorology and water source controlled year-round thermal heterogeneity. However, water entering the proglacial river from a hydropower storage reservoir caused significant increases in water temperature during both late summer and early winter, resulting in a marked longitudinal thermal discontinuity. The timing and duration of flows discharged from reservoirs, and thus effects on river thermal regimes, differed considerably from previous studies of subalpine hydropeaking. Furthermore, thermal responses to flow regulation extended laterally to some groundwater tributaries even where there was no upstream surface connectivity, suggesting significant hyporheic flow or conduction of heat through coarse alluvium. River water temperature continued to be altered even after reservoir releases had ceased due to the removal of winter snow cover and recharged groundwater sources. Together, these insights into the thermal variability have broad implications for conservation and management of alpine river systems because water temperature is a key variable influencing aquatic ecosystems, and because anthropogenic pressures on alpine environments are expected to grow in the future.

5,"Blume, T",May-jun 2015 ,From hillslope to stream: methods to investigate subsurface connectivity,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Hydrologic connectivity is the linkage of separate regions of a catchment via water flow. Knowledge of hillslope-stream connectivity (both at the surface and in the subsurface) is essential for understanding and predicting runoff responses and streamwater quality. Connectivity can be very dynamic: hillslopes may connect to the stream only during certain events or seasons. While surface connectivity is often discussed, particularly in the context of sediment transport, subsurface connectivity is more difficult to describe and assess. This difficulty has led to a wide variety in methodologies that are used in various contexts. Field approaches have focused on intensive monitoring of processes on the hillslope or the fingerprint of connectivity in the stream. Combining experimental studies with modeling allows for testing of hypotheses with respect to thresholds and controls on connectivity, and extrapolation from the hillslope scale to the catchment scale. However, as most modeling approaches are based on datasets from a few intensively studied hillslopes, this carries the inherent risk of oversimplification because it assumes that the observed hillslope responses are representative for the catchment or even the region. Focussed efforts on catchment scale assessment of hillslope-stream connectivity, as well as site intercomparisons and the search for similarity measures may allow us to capture the wider picture of the mechanisms and factors that control hillslope-stream connectivity, and its effects on flow and transport at the catchment scale. This overview focuses on how hillslope-stream connectivity has been studied and describes the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of the different methods.

6,"Zhang, T",Nov 2019 ,"Carbon dioxide exchanges and their controlling factors in Guijiang River, SW China",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The important flux estimate of carbon exchange across the water-air interface in river systems of the global carbon cycle are being increasingly recognized. However, these estimates have large uncertainty due to the incomplete temporal and spatial coverage of CO2 flux. Here, we evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics and controlling factors of CO2 exchange across the water-air interface and their potential role in regional and global carbon budgets in 25 river transects along Guijiang River (GJR), southwestern China, in July and December 2016. These river transects were divided into upstream (US), middle (MS), and downstream (DS) reaches in non-karst, karst and mixed areas, respectively. The riverine CO2 fluxes showed obvious seasonal variations, ranging from 5.62 +/- 5.93 g/(m(2).d) in summer to 1.25 +/- 4.02 g/(m(2).d) in winter, with an average value of 3.44 +/- 5.48 g/(m(2).d). The riverine CO2 fluxes exhibited significant spatial patterns, where the highest and lowest averaged CO2 fluxes occurred at MS in summer and winter, respectively. Generally, the river was a carbon source with respect to the atmosphere throughout the year. However, the CO2 fluxes were obviously restrained by aquatic metabolism and the carbonate buffer system in winter. Additionally, the absorbed CO2 at MS was due to strong photosynthetic and carbonate buffer activities. Carbon loss via atmospheric exchange in the GJR river basin was 0.032 +/- 0.047 Tg C/yr, which accounted for 20.1% of the riverine dissolved carbon fluxes (0.160 +/- 0.075 Tg C/yr). Thus, 0.128Tg C yr(-1) was sequestered in the GJR basin. Our results demonstrate the need to emphasize the importance of aquatic photosynthesis and the carbonate buffer system in restraining CO2 degassing in karst rivers. It is important to underscore the detailed spatiotemporal changes in CO2 flux to reduce uncertainty in current estimates of global riverine CO2 emissions.Show less"
7,"Valle-Levinson, A",Jan 2012 ,Impact of record flooding of a subtropical river on estuary/ocean exchange,OCEAN DYNAMICS,"Measurements of current velocity profiles during and after cresting of the Suwannee River in Northern Florida, USA, were used to investigate the effects of increased river discharge on subtidal flows near the estuarine transition with the Gulf of Mexico. Three moored velocity profilers were deployed across a lower estuary cross-section. The cross-section bathymetry consisted of a channel (similar to 5.5 m deep) near the western bank of the estuary that shoaled monotonically eastward. Two-layer gravitational exchange developed only in the deepest part of the cross-section during the river cresting and persisted for similar to 20 days. After this similar to 20-day period, the net flow decreased and was seaward throughout the water column. Net flows outside the channel were seaward throughout the observation period and were modulated by the river pulse. By comparing the estuarine response in the 5.5-m channel to theoretical responses driven by a dynamic balance between pressure gradient and stress divergence, a condition required for two-layered flow was proposed. Gravitational exchange flow should be expected when the ratio of density-driven flow to river-induced flow is greater than 0.23 to 0.28. Smaller values of this ratio should produce unidirectional, seaward flows after a river pulse. Two-layered flows restricted to the channel can be explained also with this ratio because of the sensitivity of density-driven flows to local depth and eddy viscosity. These findings need to be tested against observations in other systems affected by extreme freshwater pulses.Show less"
8,"Butturini, A",Aug 23 2005 ,Modeling storm events to investigate the influence of the stream-catchment interface zone on stream biogeochemistry,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We formulate a new mixing model to explore hydrological and chemical conditions under which the interface between the stream and catchment interface (SCI) influences the release of reactive solutes into stream water during storms. Physically, the SCI corresponds to the hyporheic/riparian sediments. In the new model this interface is coupled through a bidirectional water exchange to the conventional two components mixing model. Simulations show that the influence of the SCI on stream solute dynamics during storms is detectable when the runoff event is dominated by the infiltrated groundwater component that flows through the SCI before entering the stream and when the flux of solutes released from SCI sediments is similar to, or higher than, the solute flux carried by the groundwater. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate data from two small Mediterranean streams obtained during storms are compared to results from simulations using the new model to discern the circumstances under which the SCI is likely to control the dynamics of reactive solutes in streams. The simulations and the comparisons with empirical data suggest that the new mixing model may be especially appropriate for streams in which the periodic, or persistent, abrupt changes in the level of riparian groundwater exert hydrologic control on flux of biologically reactive fluxes between the riparian/hyporheic compartment and the stream water.Show less"

10,"Caldwell, RJ",Jul 2013 ,"Statistical modeling of daily and subdaily stream temperatures: Application to the Methow River Basin, Washington",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Management of water temperatures in the Columbia River Basin (Washington) is critical because water projects have substantially altered the habitat of Endangered Species Act listed species, such as salmon, throughout the basin. This is most important in tributaries to the Columbia, such as the Methow River, where the spawning and rearing life stages of these cold water fishes occurs. Climate change projections generally predict increasing air temperatures across the western United States, with less confidence regarding shifts in precipitation. As air temperatures rise, we anticipate a corresponding increase in water temperatures, which may alter the timing and availability of habitat for fish reproduction and growth. To assess the impact of future climate change in the Methow River, we couple historical climate and future climate projections with a statistical modeling framework to predict daily mean stream temperatures. A K-nearest neighbor algorithm is also employed to: (i) adjust the climate projections for biases compared to the observed record and (ii) provide a reference for performing spatiotemporal disaggregation in future hydraulic modeling of stream habitat. The statistical models indicate the primary drivers of stream temperature are maximum and minimum air temperature and stream flow and show reasonable skill in predictability. When compared to the historical reference time period of 1916-2006, we conclude that increases in stream temperature are expected to occur at each subsequent time horizon representative of the year 2020, 2040, and 2080, with an increase of 0.8 +/- 1.9 degrees C by the year 2080.Show less"

Secondly, the index systems of river health assessment including river morphology, hydrological and environmental characteristics, habitat elements and human activity characteristics are determined. Thirdly, set-pair (SPA) evaluation theory and extension were dealt with, a set-pair analysis-extension coupling model is constructed. Finally, taking Huangchuan Rive as an example, the ecological health evaluation on the river channel is carried out by using set-pair analysis-extension coupling model. The results of the comprehensive evaluation using the set-pair analysis-extension coupling method is obtained through calculation. It is proved by practice that the method of river health evaluation using the coupling model of set-pair analysis and extension theory could make full use of the data transformation and extension calculation, which shows the superiority in calculating correlation degree, and could reflect the determination and uncertainty of practical problems. It is possible to comprehensively consider all relevant factors. The paper provides a new idea for solving the relevant problems and obtains more accurate conclusion.Show less"
12,"Dallmann, J",Aug 2020 ,Impacts of Suspended Clay Particle Deposition on Sand-Bed Morphodynamics,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Fine particles (0.1-100 microns) are ubiquitous within the water column. Observations on the interactions between suspended fine particles and sediment beds remain limited, reducing our ability to understand the interactions and feedbacks between fine particles, morphodynamics, and hyporheic flow. We performed laboratory experiments to explore changes in bedform morphodynamics and hyporheic flow following the progressive addition of kaolinite clay to the water column above a mobile sand bed. We characterized these interactions by taking high-frequency time series measurements of bed topography and freestream clay concentration combined with solute injections and bed sediment cores to characterize subsurface properties. Deposition of initially suspended clay resulted in a decrease of bedform height, celerity, and sediment flux by 14%, 22%, and 29% when 1000 g was accumulated within the bed (equal to clay/sand mass ratio of 0.4% in the bed). The hyporheic exchange flux decreased by almost a factor of 2 for all clay additions, regardless of the amount of clay eventually deposited in the bed. Post experiment sediment cores showed clay accumulation within and below the mobile layer of the bedforms, with the peak concentration occurring at the most frequent bedform scour depth. These results demonstrate the tight coupling between bed sediment morphodynamics, fine particle (clay) deposition, and hyporheic exchange. Suspended and bed load transport rates are diminished by the transfer of suspended load to the sediment via hyporheic exchange. This coupling should be considered when estimating sediment transport rates.Show less"
13,"Laattoe, T",Oct 2014 ,Spatial periodicity in bed form-scale solute and thermal transport models of the hyporheic zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Spatially periodic solute boundaries force symmetry across a model domain by ensuring that concentrations and concentration gradients are identical at the same location on opposite boundaries. They have been used in multiple publications on a hyporheic zone model of a single ripple or dune style bed form, including variable density flow and reactive transport variants. We evaluate simulations of multibed form models without imposing spatially periodic transport to demonstrate that nonphysical solute distributions arise from the periodic solute transport assumption. That is, the flow field within the single bed form model leads to a transport scenario that violates the forced symmetry of periodic solute boundary conditions, culminating in a physically unrealistic solute distribution. Our results show that lack of symmetry between boundaries is a function of the vertical concentration gradient and two-dimensionless parameters characterizing the hyporheic and underflow flow regimes, and the solute exchange between them. We assess the error associated with the spatially periodic assumption based on an analysis of solute fluxes across the lateral bed form model boundaries. While the focus is on steady state concentration distributions, the implications for transient solute transport models are also discussed. We conclude that periodic solute transport boundary conditions should be applied only to bed form models that have minimal vertical dispersive and diffusive solute transfer. This includes gaining systems and tracers such as temperature, for which a temporally periodic flux reversal occurs across the top boundary.Key Points Assumption of solute spatial periodicity in a hyporheic zone bed form model is examined Multibed form solute and thermal models are analyzed Scenarios where the assumption of solute spatial periodicity is valid are identified 10.1002/(ISSN)1944-7973Show less"
14,"Lewin, J",Feb 2014 ,The negative relief of large river floodplains,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,"Large floodplains have multiple and complex negative relief assemblages in which depressions fall below local or general floodplain surfaces at a variety of scales. The generation and dynamics of negative relief along major alluvial corridors are described and compared. Such depressions are significant for the storage and passage of surface waters, the creation of a range of riparian, wetland, lacustrine and flowing-water habitats, and the long-term accumulation of organic materials.Working on trunk channel remnants, drowned valleys and subsidence basins, fluvial processes modify floodplain negative relief through differential erosion and sedimentation. Effectively this takes place in three genetic zones: rheic, transitional and perirheic. We show that transitional zones marginal to active channels significantly diversify form complexes, and we demonstrate the diachronous nature of zonal processes and the complex nature and pace of depression modification and infilling. Four less well-understood sets of coupled phenomena are assessed: (i) floodplains associated with discontinuous river banks, (ii) the scales and types of scroll bar generation, (iii) factors underlying the contrasts between meander and braidplain surface relief, and (iv) the generation and function of large floodplain wetlands and lakes.The survival likelihood of surface negative relief relates to geomorphological connectivity; this is described for each of the rheic, transitional and perirheic zones. The implications for contemporary aquatic system management are discussed. A key to understanding and managing negative relief on large river floodplains, and their associated ecologies and sedimentation, is to quantify both sedimentological and hydrological river-floodplain connectivity.

15,"Finlayson, B",Dec 2010 ,Rivers in Australia,FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE,"As a continent, Australia is unusual. It has a long history of habitation by a relatively small population of Aboriginals with a low technology culture. Just over 200 years ago, in 1788, it was invaded by a technological society from the UK, and the settlers brought with them an understanding of rivers and the landscapes in which they were situated which was quite at odds with the reality of the Australian continent. Australia is a piece of old continental crust derived from the break-up of Gondwana that, unlike other Gondwana continents, has experienced little tectonic modification since the break-up. It is a low relief continent dominated by arid and semi arid climates. Australian river systems have poor slope-channel coupling and poor hydrological connectivity and are characterized by low rates of sediment delivery. The flow of Australian rivers has high interannual variability, two to three times that of comparable rivers elsewhere, and highly variable flood behavior. In this paper, examples are given of particular Australian rivers to illustrate the manner in which the morphological and climatic characteristics of the continent combine to produce some distinctive river systems.Show less"
16,"Park, GS",Jun 2019 ,Video Quality-Aware Traffic Offloading System for Video Streaming Services Over 5G Networks With Dual Connectivity,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY,"This paper presents a video quality-aware traffic offloading system that provides seamless video streaming services to users by offloading part of the macrobase station traffic into small cells. The proposed system achieves a good balance between fairness and social welfare in terms of the video quality by allocating the radio resource of the macrobase station. The data flow is split into two parts toward the macrobase station and small cell AP, and the users simultaneously receive their data from both. In the proposed system, fountain code is employed to achieve dual connectivity enhancement by overcoming frequent packet loss in error-prone mobile networks and practical issues in the dual connectivity architecture. Furthermore, software-defined networking (SDN) technology is adopted not only to quickly react to time-varying network status but also to control network resources efficiently. The proposed resource allocation process is designed to require a low running time complexity. The proposed system is implemented using C/C++, Java, and a well-known open source, ONOS. The experimental results verify that the proposed system can achieve much better performance than other offloading algorithms.Show less"

A stream cipher with the characteristics of simple and high speed is suitable in the secure communications of IoT for its security. Some stream ciphers based on coupled map lattices (CML) were proposed. However, the original coupled map lattice shows evidence of correlation between the contiguous points. In this paper, we present an improved CML with a counter to overcome the weakness. The proposed scheme has the advantage of simplicity and suits the resource constrained IoT environment. We implement the proposed improved CML and analyze the proposed ciphers against some attacks. For the balance performance analysis, the numbers of 0 and 1 in the keystream are almost balanced, and the difference rates show that the proposed schemes have high key sensitivity. Finally, we present some experimental results of statistical random number tests for the output keystreams. Under the pass rates of the statistical test of NIST SP800-22, the proposed ciphers with improved CML, and compound CML are at least 95% and 97%, respectively.

The case-study presented in this paper investigates the impact of the geometry and interface conditions around a conduit on the spatial distribution ""of these exchanges. Isotopic (delta O-18 and D-delta), discharge and water head measurements were conducted at the resurgences of a karst system with a strong allogenic recharge component (Val d'Orleans, France), to estimate the amounts of water exchanged and the mixings between a saturated karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer. The spatio-temporal variability of the observed exchanges was explored using a 2D coupled continuum-conduit flow model under saturated conditions (Feflow (R)).The inputs from the water heads and stable water isotopes in the groundwater flow model suggest that the amounts of water flowing from the aquifer are significant if the conduit flow discharges are less than the conduit flow capacity. This condition creates a spatial distribution of exchanges from upstream where the aquifer feeds the conduit (recharge area) to downstream where the conduit reaches its maximum discharge capacity and can feed the aquifer (discharge area). In the intermediate transport zone no exchange between the two domains takes place that brings a new criterion to delineate the vulnerable zones to surface water.On average, 4% of the water comes from the local recharge, 80% is recent river water and 16% is old river water. During the November 2008 flood, both isotopic signatures and model suggest that exchanges fluctuate around this steady state, limited when the river water level increases and intensified when the river water level decreases. The existence of old water from the river suggests a transient storage at the aquifer/conduit interface that can be considered as an underground hyporheic zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

20,"Liu, JK",May 2020 ,Hydrological connectivity: One of the driving factors of plant communities in the Yellow River Delta,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Coastal wetlands play an important role in regional and even continental sustainable development because of their valuable ecosystem services. The coupling mechanism among hydrology, edaphic factors, and vegetation is the key to coastal wetland management. The current study conducted in the Yellow River Delta used an improved-comprehensive hydrological connectivity structure index, Topographic Over Field Capacity Index (TOFCI), based on both soil water conditions (SWC) and topography to highlight the role of hydrological connectivity on intertidal flat (IF), tidal marsh (TM), semi-artificial pond (AP) and riverside intermittent flooded (RS) wetland classes among other environmental variables. The results showed plant community distributions and structures among wetland classes differed from each other significantly, and hydrological connectivity structure is one of the driving factors. The results provided three pieces of evidence for this inference: 1) according to PCA results, the contribution of TOFCI is the highest among all environmental variables; 2) TOFCI values show significant difference among different plant communities; 3) TOFCI is also significantly correlated to species composition and distribution according to the CCA and RDA results. TOFCI values are positively linearly correlated to the plant coverage and biomass in intertidal flat wetlands according to linear regression analysis. Furthermore, salinity, soil total nitrogen and soil total phosphorus also influence plant community distribution and species composition. Finally, simple parameters for soil water conditions or topographic characteristics do not show significant explanatory power to hydrology-vegetation interaction. The results of the current study provide a new perspective for coastal wetland conservation and restoration.Show less"
21,"Kim, H",Mar 2019 ,Effect of vertical flow exchange on microbial community distributions in hyporheic zones,EPISODES,"The effect of the vertical flow direction of hyporheic flux on the bacterial community is examined. Vertical velocity change of the hyporheic zone was examined by installing a piezometer on the site, and a total of 20,242 reads were analyzed using a pyrosequencing assay to investigate the diversity of bacterial communities. Proteobacteria (55.1%) were dominant in the hyporheic zone, and Bacteroidetes (16.5%), Actinobacteria (7.1%) and other bacteria phylum (Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetesm and unclassified phylum OD1) were identified. Also, the hyporheic zone was divided into 3 points - down welling point, mixed welling point and up welling point - through vertical hydraulic gradient, and the bacterial communities were compared and analyzed. When the species diversity index was additionally analyzed based on the pyrosequencing data, richness and diversity of species were observed to be highest in the order of mixed welling point >down welling point >up welling point. Hence, quantitative changes and characteristics of the hyporheic zone were analyzed to have an effect on the resident bacterial communities.Show less"
22,"Magliozzi, C",Jul 21 2020 ,Investigating invertebrate biodiversity around large wood: taxonomic vs functional metrics,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Large wood is a key component of river channels that affects numerous hydrological, physical and geomorphological processes. It promotes a diversity of benthic habitats in-channel and has shown to support more abundant and diverse benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in previous ecological studies. However, the effects of large wood on the structural and functional diversities of hyporheic invertebrates are less well studied, and simultaneous examination of these diversity metrics on hyporheic and benthic compartments of the stream bed has not been conducted previously. Therefore, this study investigates the taxonomic and functional diversities of hyporheic and benthic invertebrate assemblages around natural accumulations of large wood in a British lowland river. Taxonomic and functional diversities were partitioned (into alpha, beta, and gamma diversities) and examined in reaches with and without large wood (control). We found that functional diversity is often decoupled from taxonomic diversity, demonstrating a functional redundancy of the macroinvertebrate assemblage for both hyporheic and benthic zones. Moreover, the highest functional variability at alpha-scale was observed in large wood habitats, which suggests that taxonomic diversity is enhanced by the small-scale environmental heterogeneity around large wood. To this end, this study contributes empirical evidence of functional and structural responses of invertebrates to large wood accumulation. Such information could be used to better understand the ecological implications of restoration works in lowland rivers and guide more effective management strategies.Show less"
23,"Sjodin, AL",Dec 1997 ,Denitrification as a component of the nitrogen budget for a large plains river,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Nitrogen dynamics of a plains reach of the South Platte River were studied over a 12-month cycle for the purpose of quantifying denitrification rates. The working hypothesis of the study was that denitrification would be of extraordinary importance in the system because of large amounts of water exchange between the channel and an extensive subsurface alluvium consisting of gravel. Denitrification losses of nitrate were quantified through the use of a mass-balance model based on detailed hydrologic information and field quantification of the rates of nitrate accrual through surface and subsurface input of water as well as nitrification. Denitrification rates ranged between 2 and 100 mg N/m(2)/hr. Distance required to achieve 90% reduction of nitrate was as short as 6 km during mid-summer and as long as 300 km during mid-winter. On an annual basis, close to half of nitrate input to a 100-km reach was removed by denitrification (3.6 x 10(6) kg/yr). Rates of nitrate loss to denitrification (annual mean, 28 mg N/m(2)/h) and overall percent removal of nitrate by denitrification were approximately 10 times as high as rates documented for rivers in the eastern U.S. The study shows that high rates of hyporheic exchange can support extraordinary rates of denitrification.Show less"
24,"McKay, SK",Sep 2013 ,Assessing upstream fish passage connectivity with network analysis,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Hydrologic connectivity is critical to the structure, function, and dynamic process of river ecosystems. Dams, road crossings, and water diversions impact connectivity by altering flow regimes, behavioral cues, local geomorphology, and nutrient cycling. This longitudinal fragmentation of river ecosystems also increases genetic and reproductive isolation of aquatic biota such as migratory fishes. The cumulative effects on fish passage of many structures along a river are often substantial, even when individual barriers have negligible impact. Habitat connectivity can be improved through dam removal or other means of fish passage improvement (e.g., ladders, bypasses, culvert improvement). Environmental managers require techniques for comparing alternative fish passage restoration actions at alternative or multiple locations. Herein, we examined a graph-theoretic algorithm for assessing upstream habitat connectivity to investigate both basic and applied fish passage connectivity problems. First, we used hypothetical watershed configurations to assess general alterations to upstream fish passage connectivity with changes in watershed network topology (e.g., linear vs. highly dendritic) and the quantity, location, and passability of each barrier. Our hypothetical network modeling indicates that locations of dams with limited passage efficiency near the watershed outlet create a strong fragmentation signal but are not individually sufficient to disconnect the system. Furthermore, there exists a threshold in the number of dams beyond which connectivity declines precipitously, regardless of watershed topology and dam configuration. Watersheds with highly branched configurations are shown to be less susceptible to disconnection as measured by this metric. Second, we applied the model to prioritize barrier improvement in the mainstem of the Truckee River, Nevada, USA. The Truckee River application demonstrates the ability of the algorithm to address conditions common in fish passage projects including incomplete data, parameter uncertainty, and rapid application. This study demonstrates the utility of a graph-theoretic approach for assessing fish passage connectivity in dendritic river networks assuming full basin utilization for a given species, guild, or community of concern.Show less"

26,"Henry, JC",Dec 2003 ,Spatial segregation of periphyton communities in a desert stream: causes and consequences for N cycling,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The goal of this research was to understand the underlying causes of patterns of distribution and abundance of N-fixing periphyton and non N-fixing periphyton in a desert stream, and to evaluate potential consequences of these patterns for stream N cycling. Sampling of periphyton communities at sandbar edges in Sycamore Creek, Arizona, revealed community differences related to direction of hydrologic exchange with the subsurface. N-fixing cyanobacteria were abundant at sandbar inwelling edges. Non N-fixing taxa predominated at outwelling edges. We evaluated several predictions of the hypothesis that this difference was attributable to differences in N availability at sandbar edges. NO3-N at outwelling edges was 3.5 times higher than at inwelling edges, consistent with past work showing microbial nitrification to characterize sandbars. Non N-fixing and N-fixing periphyton biovolume were related to NO3-N concentration at edges. Reciprocal transplants of periphyton from original edges to edges with the opposite direction of hydrologic exchange revealed significant declines in periphyton relative to controls. Experiments using NO3-N diffusing substrates revealed non N-fixing taxa to be more abundant where NO3-N was elevated. N-fixing periphyton was, in contrast, more abundant at naturally low NO3-N or unenriched sites. These results support the hypothesis that differences in N availability between inwelling and outwelling edges caused the observed pattern of periphyton distribution at sandbar edges. Last, 80% of outwelling NO3-N was removed from outflowing water by periphyton at sandbar edges. This temporary retention of available N results in a surface stream depleted of inorganic N and accentuates spatial heterogeneity of periphyton communities in this ecosystem.Show less"

28,"Jarvie, HP",Oct 30 2006 ,"Within-river nutrient processing in Chalk streams: The Pang and Lambourn, UK",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"This work examines baseflow nutrient concentrations and loads along two rural Chalk streams, the Pang and Lambourn. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and boron (13) concentrations in these streams were heavily influenced by point-source inputs and the effects of downstream flow accretion and dilution. Unlike B (which is chemically conservative), SRP loads were also strongly influenced by in-stream processing resulting in uptake of SRP, particularly immediately downstream of sewage effluent discharges, where rates of SRP uptake were highest. For the upper River Pang, up to 80% of SRP loads were lost within 4 km downstream of Compton sewage treatment works (STW) and on the River Lambourn up to 55% of SRP toads were lost within 1.6 km downstream of East Shefford STW. In contrast, nitrate (NO3) concentrations at sites along the Pang and Lambourn were largely controlled by groundwater inputs and plant uptake during periods of high photosynthetic activity in spring and summer and silicon (Si) by diatom uptake in April/May. There were net gains in NO3 toads along the river reaches, as a result of volumetric increases in groundwater discharge, and, compared with SRP, the role of in-stream processing of NO3 appeared low.Examination of SRP exchange by bed sediment and uptake of SRP into algal biofilms indicated that biofilms accounted for only a very small percentage of in-stream P-uptake, but that bed sediment SRP-exchanges had a more important control on baseflow SRP concentrations and loads. Point source P remediation at East Shefford STW, by removal of P from final effluent (P-stripping), resulted in 70-90% reductions in river-water SRP loads. After introduction of P-stripping at East Shefford STW, bed sediments immediately downstream of the STW switched from being net sinks to net sources of SRP. Our results show that, in the immediate aftermath of P-stripping, bed sediment SRP-release was responsible for a 30 mu g-P l(-1) rise in river-water SRP along this reach. White this increase in SRP concentration, as a result of bed sediment SRP release, is potentially ecologically significant, it is small in relation to the increase in SRP concentrations from effluent prior to P-stripping, which resulted in increases in SRP concentration of up to 500 mu g-P l(-1). There was a six-month tag between the introduction of P-stripping at East Shefford STW and bed sediment EPC0 recovering to equilibrium levels with the overlying river water (and thus negligible SRP release). Recovery of bed sediments to equilibrium levels is likely to have occurred as a result of winnowing and removal of high-EPC0 sediment and delivery of tower EPC0 sediment from upstream. Under higher/more variable flow conditions and greater rates of in-channel sediment erosion/delivery, more rapid recovery of bed sediment EPC0 levels following P-stripping might be expected.

Denitrification measurements were made on intact sediment cores using the N-2/Ar and isotope pairing techniques. We measured nitrate (NO3--N) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations in the water column at the time of core collection and evaluated rates of sediment-water exchange of dissolved oxygen (O-2) in conjunction with denitrification rate determinations. Nitrate concentrations in the tributary streams and river water varied over an order or magnitude, from about 10 to 110 mu mol/L, while NH4+-N concentrations were lower, varying from 0.6 to 10.8 mu mol/L. Sediments consistently consumed dissolved O-2, with rates varying from 256 to 1418 mu mol m(-2) h(-1). Most cores actively denitrified with rates ranging to 222 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1). On average, coupled nitrification-denitritication accounted for 66% of total denitrification. Lowest rates of denitrification were generally observed during December, when the water temperature was lowest at 4 degrees C. No other relationship was identified between rates of denitrification and measured physicochemical variables within or among sites or dates as sampling frequency and replication were low. Our study suggests that denitrification represents a sink of about 5% for the NO3--N load to the mainstem Neuse River and tributary streams.Show less"

This has decreased the hydrological connectivity between rivers and their floodplains. We quantified the hydrological regime of a wet grassland meadow prior to and after the removal of river embankments. River and groundwater chemistry were also monitored to examine hydrological controls on floodplain nutrient status. Prior to restoration, the highest river flows (approximate to 2 m(3) s(1)) were retained by the embankments. Under these flow conditions the usual hydraulic gradient from the floodplain to the river was reversed so that subsurface flows were directed towards the floodplain. Groundwater was depleted in dissolved oxygen (mean: 0.6 mg O-2 L-1) and nitrate (mean: 0.5 mg NO3 -N L-1) relative to river water (mean: 10.8 mg O-2 L-1 and 6.2 mg NO3 -N L-1, respectively). Removal of the embankments has reduced the channel capacity by an average of 60%.

32,"Chen, CP",Jan 2 2023 ,Hardcore viewer engagement and social exchange with streamers and their digital live streaming communities,QUALITATIVE MARKET RESEARCH,"Purpose Digital live streaming applications, combined with the broadcasting of cross-modal, video-mediated communication in the social networking community, have grown in popularity in recent years. A theoretical gap exists regarding a comprehensive framework that explains hardcore viewer engagement through the social exchanges in digital live streaming communities. Traditional viewers engaged with a single-dimensional focal object, but nowadays, viewers interact with multidimensional and multiobjects through the social exchanges (e.g. virtual gifts, emotional supports) in live streaming digital communities. This study aims to address this void in the marketing literature of hardcore viewer engagement under dynamic social exchanges in digital live streaming communities. Design/methodology/approach This research used a qualitative approach. The data collections were from October 2018 to January 2020. Data were collected in semistructured interviews with 17 Media 21 hardcore viewers. Findings The outcomes of hardcore viewer engagement and social exchange include three main stages: introduction, immersion and enthusiasm. It indicates that loyalty and active hardcore viewer-streamer relationships were fostered through the process of hardcore viewer engagement and social exchange with multiple objects and dimensions. Research limitations/implications There are three main implications to the literature in this study. First, this empirical study extends the concept of consumer engagement to hardcore viewer engagement, and social exchange is found to trigger social behavior and relations in a digital live streaming community. Second, it contributes to the social media community literature. Hardcore viewer engagement provides a broad dimensional scope to examine digital live streaming community participation by integrating the cognitive, affective and behavioral aspects. Finally, it contributes to the literature of social exchange theory. It indicates that the extension of hardcore viewer-streamer social relationships is not restricted to traditional mass media but can be fostered in digital live streaming communities. Practical implications It contributes to the consumer engagement literature by exploring in depth viewer engagement dimensionality in a rich digital live streaming context. This study proposed a framework for understanding the stages and outcomes of viewer engagement and parasocial interactions according to three dimensions and multiple objects, which lacked empirical validation in previous studies. Social implications This study also contributes to the social media community literature. In capturing the functions of such groups, the variables of interest were ""participation,"" ""involvement"" and ""membership."" These variables were determined through behavioral actions or intentions. In contrast, viewer engagement provided a broad dimensional scope to examine digital live streaming community participation by integrating the cognitive, affective and behavioral aspects. Originality/value The findings of this study indicate that the extension of parasocial relationships is not restricted to traditional mass media but can be fostered in digital live streaming communities that are designed to bring the viewer close to streamer(s), community members and system functions and activities.Although digital live streaming applications differ from traditional parasocial interaction environments because they offer direct, instantaneous, multiple communication among streamer(s), system functions and community members, the findings of the present study indicate that viewer-streamer-viewer parasocial relationships established both online and offline are often interwoven.Show less"
33,"Chen, HL",Sep 1 2020 ,Extraction of connected river networks from multi-temporal remote sensing imagery using a path tracking technique,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,"Precise delineation of river networks is important for accurate hydrological and flood modelling. Whilst remote sensing (RS) has showed great potential in monitoring hydrological changes over space and time, the existing RS-based methods extract river networks based on local morphologies and seldom take into account the overall hydrological connectivity of the rivers. The existing methods also commonly neglect the effect of seasonal variation of water surfaces and the existence of temporary water bodies, which deteriorate the precision of positioning river networks. To address these challenges, a new two-stage method is developed to Extract spatiotemporal variation of water surfaces based on Multi-temporal remote sensing Imagery and Delineate connected river networks with improved accuracy (EMID method for short) using a path tracking technique. The EMID method delineates connected river networks using (a) multi-temporal imagery and a Random Forest model to synoptically map the location and extent of water surfaces under different hydrological conditions, and (b) an optimization algorithm to find the best river paths based on water-occurrence frequency. Four drainage basins with various river morphologies are considered to validate EMID. Comparing with alternative methods, the EMID method consistently produces river network results with improved accuracy in terms of stream location, river coverage and network connectivity.Show less"

This paper constructs a ""Size-Density-Morphology"" urban ecological resilience evaluation system, uses a coupling coordination degree model to measure the degree of coupling coordination between urbanization and ecological resilience in the Pearl River Delta from 2000 to 2015, and conducts an in-depth discussion on its spatiotemporal characteristics. The results show the following. (1) From 2000 to 2015, the urbanization level of cities in the study area generally increased while the level of ecological resilience declined. The coupling coordination degree between the two systems decreased from basic coordination to basic imbalance. (2) In terms of spatial distribution, the coupling coordination degree between urbanization and ecological resilience of cities presented a circular pattern that centered on the cities at the estuary of the Pearl River and increased toward the periphery. (3) Ecological resilience sub-systems played variable roles in the coupling coordination between urbanization and ecological resilience. Specifically, size resilience mainly played a reverse blocking role; the influence of morphology resilience was generally positive and continued to increase over time; the effect of density resilience was positive and continued to decline and further became negative after falling below zero. The main pathways for achieving coordinated and sustainable development of future urbanization and ecological resilience in the Pearl River Delta include: leading the coordinated development of regions with new urbanization, improving ecological resilience by strictly observing the three areas and three lines, adapting to ecological carrying capacity, and rationally arranging urban green spaces.Show less"

We use the model to partition the relative influences of redd topography versus altered hydraulic Conductivity (winnowing of fines during spawning) oil egg pocket conditions for a simulated pool-riffle channel with a redd placed at the pool tail. Predictions show that altered hydraulic conductivity is the primary factor for enhancing hyporheic velocities and dissolved oxygen content within the egg pocket. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that redds induce hyporheic Circulation that is nested within that caused by pool-riffle topography and that spawning-related changes in hyporheic velocities and dissolved oxygen content Could create conditions Suitable for incubation in locations that otherwise Would be unfavorable (reinforcing the notion that salmonids actively modify their environment in ways that may be beneficial to their progeny).Show less"

Current methods focus on either vertical pore water velocity or Darcy flux measurements. Both parameters must be understood to evaluate residence time and mass flux of constituents. Furthermore, most instruments are not well suited for monitoring instantaneous velocity or flux under dynamic exchange conditions. For this reason, the flux detection probe (FDP) was designed that employs electrogeophysical measurements to estimate in situ sediment porosity, which can be used to convert pore water velocity to Darcy flux. Dynamic pore water velocity is obtained by monitoring fluid conductivity and temperature along the FDP probe. Pressure sensors deployed at the top and bottom of the probe provide the additional information necessary to estimate vertical permeability. This study focuses on the use of a geophysical method to estimate pore water velocity, porosity, and permeability within a controlled soil column where simulated river water displaces simulated groundwater. The difference between probe derived and theoretical pore water velocity using natural tracers such as electrical conductivity and temperature was -4.9 and 3.9% for downward flow and 1.1 and 12.8% for upward flow, respectively. The difference in porosity calculated from mass and volume packed in the soil column and probe measure porosity ranged between -3.2% and 1.5%. Also, the calculated hydraulic conductivity differed from probe derived values by -8.9%.Show less"

Water use efficiency changes prior to 2009 had already reduced surface return flows. A dimensionless and normalised variable, connectivity factor (CF), has been used to analyse the cumulative impact on river flow from actions that alter groundwater recharge or extraction. CF is objectively estimated from existing modelling outputs for three large alluvial groundwater systems in south-eastern MDB relevant to a major water use efficiency program. Lower values of CF(0.05-0.45) imply lower reductions of return flows, less impacts on recovered water entitlements, with impacts more likely to be managed adaptively within current water management plans. The study should help allay concerns by explaining why previous estimates had been overly high.Show less"
40,"Zhang, ZY",Aug 2021 ,Effects of Heterogeneous Stream-Groundwater Exchange on the Source Composition of Stream Discharge and Solute Load,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of water and solutes between the stream and groundwater along a stream network affects the source composition of discharge and solute load in the stream. To date, this hydrologic turnover has only been analyzed with respect to the exchange of water. In this study, we extend the concept of hydrologic turnover to solutes and analyze the effects of different hydrologic conditions on the spatial patterns and magnitude of exchange fluxes. Based on a coupled stream-groundwater model built in MODFLOW using the Streamflow-routing package, we simulated stream-groundwater exchange along a stream of 30 km in length and evaluated the evolution of stream water source composition under different precipitation and streamflow conditions. Results show that even for highly variable hydrologic conditions, the direction of stream-groundwater exchange (loss/gain) remained unchanged in consistently gaining or losing reaches, but changed in interspersed transitional reaches. The comparison between the source composition of discharge and nitrate load in stream water revealed a decoupling of discharge and solute load contribution from groundwater to the stream, as zones of high water gains do not necessarily coincide with zones of high solute concentrations. Overall, nearly 80% of total groundwater contributions to the outflow of water from the catchment were generated over only 20% of the total stream length. Our research highlights the importance of distinguishing water and solute load contributions to streams. This in turn implies that to reduce groundwater-borne nutrient loads to streams, measures need to focus on the specific reaches with highest load contributions.Show less"
41,"Molinari, B",Apr 2022 ,Impact of water resource development on connectivity and primary productivity across a tropical river floodplain,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Floodplain wetlands provide an important subsidy for riverine food webs as sites of high algal production. However, this subsidy depends on the degree of landscape connectivity during flood pulses, which provides the opportunity for movement of higher order consumers between rivers and floodplains to access these productive habitats. Changes in floodplain inundation extent and duration, due to variable wet season flows or water resource development (WRD), can impact landscape connectivity and ultimately the magnitude of the food web subsidy. We explored landscape connectivity using graph theory and derived four new metrics to measure how different flow scenarios can affect connectivity and algal production. We considered a historic scenario with the present level of water resource development in our study area, the Mitchell River, and a WRD scenario with the inclusion of three new dams in the catchment. We generated 240 unique daily spatial graphs, using surface water inundation maps across 40-day flood events to compare a dry year (2006), an average flow year (2001) and a wet year (2009) with and without a WRD scenario. Drier years and WRD scenario resulted in floodplain fragmentation, potentially constraining the movement of higher order consumers. Changes in connectivity due to WRD resulted in predicted reductions of up to 26% of algal production on the floodplain that was otherwise connected to the main river channels. Synthesis and applications. The approach developed in this study provides new metrics to identify how changes in floodplain surface water extent due to water resource development and climatic variation may impact ecosystem function such as connectivity that facilitates access of higher order consumers to primary production in floodplain wetlands. With a direct link to river flow alteration, these metrics can inform catchment planning and management to ensure that the conservation of floodplain ecosystem functions is adequately considered in water resource management decisions.Show less"
42,"Xu, JX",Aug 2016 ,"Sediment jamming of a trunk stream by hyperconcentrated floods from small tributaries: case of the Upper Yellow River, China",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,"The tributary-trunk stream relationship is investigated with respect to hyperconcentrated flows and coupled wind-water processes in the Yellow River, China. Ten small tributaries that drain only 3% of the total drainage area of the trunk stream transport large amounts of relatively coarse sediment from the desert to the trunk stream during hyperconcentrated floods. The resultant strong sedimentation often jams the trunk stream, leading to serious disasters. This study reveals the cause of this interesting phenomenon and proposes countermeasures for disaster reduction. A typical sediment-jamming event (SJE) in July 1989 was thoroughly analysed based on the observational data, including the beginning, development and final stages of the event. An index of the geomorphologic effectiveness of the tributary on the trunk stream and a number of indices describing SJEs and the influencing factors are adopted, based on which a discrimination relationship for the occurrence of SJEs is established and some statistical relationships are also established. The SJE's hydrological and geomorphologic impacts are discussed at short timescales (from several days to one month) and at long time scales (up to 46years). The results may help to gain a new insight into the study of the tributary-trunk stream relationship, and provide useful information for sediment management and disaster-reduction planning in the drainage basin. Countermeasures are suggested to reduce the channel sedimentation and the risk of sediment-jamming disaters.Show less"
43,"Choi, J",Aug 1998 ,Modeling CO2 degassing and pH in a stream-aquifer system,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Final Creek, Arizona receives an inflow of ground water with high dissolved inorganic carbon (57-75 mg/l) and low pH (5.8-6.3). There is an observed increase of in-stream pH from approximately 6.0-7.8 over the 3 km downstream of the point of groundwater inflow. We hypothesized that CO2 gas-exchange was the most important factor causing the pH increase in this stream-aquifer system. An existing transport model, for coupled ground water-surface water systems (OTIS), was modified to include carbonate equilibria and CO2 degassing, used to simulate alkalinity, total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T), and pH in Pinal Creek. Because of the non-linear relation between pH and Cn the modified transport model used the numerical iteration method to solve the non-linearity. The transport model parameters were determined by the injection of two tracers, bromide and propane. The resulting simulations of alkalinity, C-T and pH reproduced, without fitting, the overall trends in downstream concentrations. A multi-parametric sensitivity analysis (MPSA) was used to identify the relative sensitivities of the predictions to six of the physical and chemical parameters used in the transport model. MPSA results implied that C-T and pH in stream water were controlled by the mixing of ground water with stream water and CO2 degassing. The relative importance of these two processes varied spatially depending on the hydrologic conditions, such as stream flow velocity and whether a reach gained or lost stream water caused by the interaction with the ground water. The coupled transport model with CO2 degassing and generalized sensitivity analysis presented in this study can be applied to evaluate carbon transport and pH in other coupled stream-ground water systems.

44,"Keruzore, AA",Apr 2013 ,The role of lateral connectivity in the maintenance of macrophyte diversity and production in large rivers,AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,"Large European river floodplains have been intensively reduced through human activities over several millennia. Ecological assessments of natural large river systems remain rare and potentially flawed since they typically omit either the main channel of the river or, more commonly, aquatic habitats that occur naturally in the floodplain of dynamic systems. Surveys were conducted over a longitudinal and lateral gradient to assess distribution, richness and production of macrophytes along two little-disturbed large upland rivers in Scotland. Lateral dynamics, through the creation of backwaters, underpinned the occurrence, abundance and production of macrophytes in these rivers. Indeed, backwaters, despite representing only 5% of the total area of aquatic habitat, supported a significantly higher concentration of species (65% of species recorded at the riverscape scale were unique to backwaters) than the main channel. The frequency with which backwaters were connected to the main channel during flood flows influenced their species richness. Highest species richness in backwaters was typically found at low connectivity. Standing crop in backwaters was 150 times higher per unit area than in the main channel, while at the riverscape scale backwaters accounted for an average 89% of aquatic plant biomass. The highest plant biomass was found at low and medium connectivity with the main channel. Backwaters appear to be crucial habitats in maintaining macrophyte diversity and production in large river ecosystems. These results emphasize the importance of river hydrodynamics and lateral connectivity in maintaining macrophyte community diversity along large rivers. The results illustrate also the potentially very significant role of backwaters as source habitats supplying propagules and organic matter to downstream reaches. It is argued that the entire riverscape (floodplain plus main channel) must be considered in the holistic assessment of such systems, while protection of this resource requires greater recognition of linkages within and across habitats, both aquatic and terrestrial, to be effective.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
45,"Calles, O",Dec 2009 ,CONNECTIVITY IS A TWO-WAY STREET-THE NEED FOR A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO FISH PASSAGE PROBLEMS IN REGULATED RIVERS,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"We evaluated the effects of a rehabilitation project, whose goal was to re-establish longitudinal connectivity for anadromous trout in the regulated river Eman. We used a holistic approach, by tagging and following both upstream-migrating spawners (N = 348) and downstream-migrating smolts (N = 80) and kelts as they passed two hydroelectric plants (HEP 2-3) with nature-like fishways.When migrating upstream, 84-88% of the spawners stopped, primarily at spawning grounds, before reaching HEP2. The proportion of stoppers was lower (56%) for fish that had been to the fishways in previous years, indicating that the recolonization rate is likely to increase over time. Of the spawners that approached the fishway at HEP2. 77% rapidly located the fishway situated next to the tail-race, resulting in ail attraction efficiency of 81% and a passage efficiency of 95%. The time required to locate the fishway inside the former channel at HEP3 was substantial, but the attraction efficiency (89%) and passage efficiency (97%) were nevertheless high.The kelts swam downstream mainly in spring, using spill gates and the fishways, to swim past HEP2 and 3 and continue downstream to the Baltic Sea. Iteroparity was confirmed by the fact that 20% of the spawners were tagged in previous years. Smolt loss was about 30% for both HEPs, with a higher turbine-induced loss 30% for fish passing through Francis runners than a Kaplan runner. Fifteen per cent of the tagged smolt reached the sea and none of these fish had swum through the Francis runners.It will probably take many years before longitudinal connectivity is fully re-established in the river Eman, due to substantial losses of both upstream-migrating spawners (35% loss) and downstream-migrating smolts (50%) and kelts. In addition, smolt production in areas upstream of HEP3 is far below carrying capacity. Thus, additional measures that not only facilitate movement of upstream spawners, but also reduce mortality and injuries of downstream migrants are urgently needed to create a self-sustaining fish population.

Thus, reading network connectivity may also show decreases that are positively associated with increases in reading ability. However, the developmental trajectory of reading network connectivity in typically developing readers is not yet well established. In the current study, we use a longitudinal design to determine how connectivity changes over time, and how these changes relate to changes in reading skill. We find that longitudinal increases in reading ability are associated with higher initial connectivity in the dorsal stream between fusiform and inferior parietal cortex, implicated in phonological decoding, followed by decreases in connectivity in this stream over time. We further find that increases in reading ability are supported by maintenance of connectivity in the ventral stream between inferior occipital and fusiform cortex, suggesting a more mature automatic orthographic recognition strategy. Readers who show little reading improvement over time do not attain high levels of connectivity in the dorsal stream at any time point, and their ventral stream connectivity decreases over time. These results together suggest that superior reading ability is initially supported by phonological decoding, with a decreased reliance on this strategy as reading becomes more automated. Our results indicate that development of the dorsal and ventral streams are closely linked, and support the hypothesis that a decrease in the dorsal stream is important for ventral stream development.Show less"
47,"Larrieu, KG",Sep 2021 ,Automated analysis of lateral river connectivity and fish stranding risks. Part 2: Juvenile Chinook salmon stranding at a river rehabilitation site,ECOHYDROLOGY,"The dynamics of fish stranding have not been academically investigated within the context of physical adjustments to rivers for habitat enhancement purposes. River projects may aim to help fish populations but instead may function as attractive nuisances reducing populations because of unaccounted-for stranding risk. This study applies a novel algorithm to predict spatially explicit, meter-resolution fish stranding risk at a river rehabilitation site in California to address three scientific questions. Postproject disconnected wetted area predictions were validated against water surface elevation measurements and time lapse photography of flow reductions and stranding events. A comparison of preproject, final design, and postproject topographies revealed that the occurrence and severity of stranding events is highly sensitive to side-channel topographic structure and postproject morphodynamic change. Even with moderate flows, side-channel exits tend to close off by bars built across them via bedload transport. Implications for river management practices and river rehabilitation project design are discussed.Show less"
48,"Duff, JH",Sep 1998 ,A mini drivepoint sampler for measuring pore water solute concentrations in the hyporheic zone of sand-bottom streams,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"A new method for collecting pore-water samples in sand and gravel streambeds is presented. We developed a mini drivepoint solution sampling (MINIPOINT) technique to collect pore-water samples at 2.5-cm vertical resolution. The sampler consisted of six small-diameter stainless steel drivepoints arranged in a 10-cm-diameter circular array. In a simple procedure, the sampler was installed in the streambed to preset drivepoint depths of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, and 15.0 cm. Sampler performance was evaluated in the Shingobee River, Minnesota, and Final Creek, Arizona, by measuring the vertical gradient of chloride concentration in pore water beneath the streambed that was established by the uninterrupted injection to the stream for 3 d. Pore-water samples were withdrawn from all drivepoints simultaneously. In the first evaluation, the vertical chloride gradient was unchanged at withdrawal rates between 0.3 and 4.0 ml min(-1) but was disturbed at higher rates. In the second evaluation, up to 70 ml of pore water was withdrawn from each drivepoint at a withdrawal rate of 2.5 ml min(-1) without disturbing the vertical chloride gradient. Background concentrations of other solutes were also determined with MINIPOINT sampling. Steep vertical gradients were present for biologically reactive solutes such as DO, NH4+, NO3-, and dissolved organic C in the top 20 cm of the streambed. These detailed solute profiles in the hyporheic zone could not have been determined without a method for close interval vertical sampling that does not disturb natural hydrologic mixing between stream water and groundwater.Show less"
