Few studies have considered the influence of flooding on surface water-groundwater interactions. This research examines the temporally variable water storage and exchange in a stream in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica, where diel flood pulses occur due to glacial melt. Several MDV streams display truncated discharge peaks, suggesting water storage between the source glacier and the gauging station. We tested the hypothesis that stream braids and subsurface water storage contribute to the difference between glacial melt and stream outflow hydrographs by constructing a coupled surface water routing and subsurface water flow model. This model routes water into stream braids at high flows and allows this water to infiltrate and return to the stream via subsurface flow paths as flows recede. Our simulation demonstrates the importance of surface-subsurface water interactions in controlling the hydrograph shape. Maximum simulated discharge was sensitive to storage parameters including aquifer depth and the flooding threshold, while minimum discharge was sensitive to hydraulic conductivity. Subsurface storage volume varied by 38% over a diel cycle and stream-subsurface exchange rates varied from 0 to 0.19 m(3) h(-1) m(-1), with exchange from the stream to the subsurface during high flows, and vice versa at low flows. These results underscore how unsteady flow can increase hyporheic interactions and ecosystem productivity, and provide support for maintaining natural stream morphology and flow regimes.Show less"
1,"Shih, WR",Sep 16 2020 ,Hyporheic Exchange Under Undular Flows Over a Coarse Granular Bed,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Undular flows over riffles (standing waves with underlying open-channel flows) facilitate a quality environmental setting for riverine habitats. Understanding their link with hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) is important from eco-hydro-geomorphic perspectives. We conduct refractive index-matched scanning experiments to resolve the exchange between surface and subsurface flows across a coarse granular bed. We show that the HEF includes wave pumping (WP) and grain-scale pumping (GP) components. Mechanistically, the dynamic pressure gradient best explains the HEF on both wave and grain scales. However, due to the underlying open-channel flow, the result exhibits a phase lag compared to the theoretical WP, suggesting a necessary shift from the existing water surface-based model to a pressure gradient-based approach. Quantitatively, with the present experimental setting, the GP flux is 1 order of magnitude smaller than the WP flux. The relative significance of WP to GP is further increased at higher discharges, indicating potential utility of WP in habitat vitalization.Show less"
2,"Hoagland, B",Jun 2017 ,Hyporheic zone influences on concentration-discharge relationships in a headwater sandstone stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Complex subsurface flow dynamics impact the storage, routing, and transport of water and solutes to streams in headwater catchments. Many of these hydrogeologic processes are indirectly reflected in observations of stream chemistry responses to rain events, also known as concentration-discharge (CQ) relations. Identifying the relative importance of subsurface flows to stream CQ relationships is often challenging in headwater environments due to spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, this study combines a diverse set of methods, including tracer injection tests, cation exchange experiments, geochemical analyses, and numerical modeling, to map groundwater-surface water interactions along a first-order, sandstone stream (Garner Run) in the Appalachian Mountains of central Pennsylvania. The primary flow paths to the stream include preferential flow through the unsaturated zone (""interflow""), flow discharging from a spring, and groundwater discharge. Garner Run stream inherits geochemical signatures from geochemical reactions occurring along each of these flow paths. In addition to end-member mixing effects on CQ, we find that the exchange of solutes, nutrients, and water between the hyporheic zone and the main stream channel is a relevant control on the chemistry of Garner Run. CQ relationships for Garner Run were compared to prior results from a nearby headwater catchment overlying shale bedrock (Shale Hills). At the sandstone site, solutes associated with organo-mineral associations in the hyporheic zone influence CQ, while CQ trends in the shale catchment are affected by preferential flow through hillslope swales. The difference in CQ trends document how the lithology and catchment hydrology control CQ relationships.Plain Language Summary Stream chemistry serves as a fingerprint for the processes that occur in the critical zone, which extends from unweathered bedrock to the top of the tree canopy. The critical zone thus includes all resources critical to life. This paper evaluates chemical and physical processes in the critical zone, specifically in soils, streams, and groundwater. Our work suggests the important influence of groundwater-surface water interactions on mountain streams with an emphasis on the transport of water and solutes through the streambed. By comparing these transport processes on sandstone and shale, we hypothesize that the type of rock underlying a watershed can influence the relative importance of groundwater-surface water interactions on stream chemistry.Show less"
3,"Robertson, AL",Apr 2010 ,"Ecology of the hyporheic zone: origins, current knowledge and future directions",FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Traian Orghidan's seminal paper on the hyporheic zone was published in German in Archiv fur Hydrobiologie 50 years ago. To celebrate this anniversary, it has now been translated into English and republished in Fundamental and Applied Limnology, the successor to Archiv fur Hydrobiologie, as part of this special issue on hyporheic zone ecology. Here we examine the development and current state of knowledge of four aspects of hyporheic zone ecology first articulated by Orghidan. First, we consider the ecotonal nature of the hyporheic zone (HZ) and its relationship to the wider stream ecosystem; second, surface water and groundwater habitat interconnectivity within the hyporheic zone; third, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the HZ and how this may influence its function as a refugium for taxa during disturbances; and lastly interactions between hyporheic invertebrates and pore water volume, bacterial densities and particulate organic carbon. We outline the characteristics of the hyporheic zone that may determine how effective it will be as a refugium for benthic taxa during disturbances and consider the biological traits of benthic species most able to utilise the HZ as a refugium. Finally, we examine an important avenue of research that has developed since Orghidans paper reflecting significant scientific and technological advances; the role of the hyporheic zone in stream nutrient dynamics. We conclude by considering some areas where further research is likely to advance our understanding of the hyporheic zone and its interaction with the wider stream ecosystemShow less"
4,"Ward, AS",Sep 19 2014 ,Spatially distributed characterization of hyporheic solute transport during baseflow recession in a headwater mountain stream using electrical geophysical imaging,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The transport of solutes along hyporheic flowpaths is recognized as central to numerous biogeochemical cycles, yet our understanding of how this transport changes with baseflow recession, particularly in a spatially distributed manner, is limited. We conducted four steady-state solute tracer injections and collected electrical resistivity data to characterize hyporheic transport during seasonal baseflow recession in the RI Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, USA). We used temporal moment analysis of pixels generated from inversion of electrical resistivity data to compress time-lapse data into descriptive statistics (mean arrival time, temporal variance, and temporal skewness) for each pixel. A spatial visualization of these temporal moments in the subsurface at each of five 2-D transects perpendicular to the stream was interpreted to inform transport processes. As baseflow recession progressed we found increasing first arrival times, persistence, mean arrival time, temporal variance, and coefficient of variation, and decreasing skewness. These trends suggest that changes in hydrologic forcing alter the relative influence of transport phenomena (e.g., advection vs. other transport processes such as dispersion) along flowpaths. Spatial coverage obtained from electrical resistivity images allowed for qualitative comparison of spatial patterns in temporal moments both at an individual cross-section as well as between cross sections. We found that geomorphologic controls (e.g., bedrock confinement vs. gravel wedge deposits) resulted in different distributions and metrics of hyporheic transport. Results of this study provide further evidence that hyporheic transport is highly variable both in space and through the baseflow recession period. Geophysical images differentiate advection-dominated flowpaths from those that are more affected by other transport processes (e.g., dispersion, mobile-immobile exchange). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

5,"Haggerty, R",Jul 1 2002 ,Power-law residence time distribution in the hyporheic zone of a 2nd-order mountain stream,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"[1] We measured the hyporheic residence time distribution in a 2nd-order mountain stream at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, and found it to be a power-law over at least 1.5 orders of magnitude in time (1.5 hr to 3.5 d). The residence time distribution has a very long tail which scales as t(-1.28), and is poorly characterized by an exponential model. Because of the small power-law exponent, efforts to characterize the mean hyporheic residence time (t(s))in this system result in estimates that are scale invariant, increasing with the characteristic advection time within the stream channel (t(ad)). The distribution implies the hyporheic zone has a very large range of exchange timescales, with significant quantities of water and solutes stored over timescales very much longer than t(ad). The hyporheic zone in such streams may contribute to short-time fractal scaling in time series of solute concentrations observed in small-watershed studies.Show less"
6,"Quick, AM",Nov 1 2016 ,Controls on Nitrous Oxide Emissions from the Hyporheic Zones of Streams,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"The magnitude and mechanisms of nitrous oxide (N2O) release from rivers and streams are actively debated. The complex interactions of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical controls on emissions of this important greenhouse gas preclude prediction of when and where N2O emissions will be significant. We present observations from column and large-scale flume experiments supporting an integrative model of N2O emissions from stream sediments. Our results show a distinct, replicable, pattern of nitrous oxide generation and consumption dictated by subsurface (hyporheic) residence times and biological nitrogen reduction rates. Within this model, N2O emission from stream sediments requires subsurface residence times (and microbially mediated reduction rates) be sufficiently long (and fast reacting) to produce N2O by nitrate reduction but also sufficiently short (or slow reacting) to limit N2O conversion to dinitrogen gas. Most subsurface exchange will not result in N2O emissions; only specific, intermediate, residence times (reaction rates) will both produce and release N2O to the stream. We also confirm previous observations that elevated nitrate and declining organic carbon reactivity increase N2O production, highlighting the importance of associated reaction rates in controlling N2O accumulation. Combined, these observations help constrain when N2O release will occur, providing a predictive link between stream geomorphology, hydrodynamics, and N2O emissions.Show less"
7,"Bawa, N",Dec 15 2014 ,"Controls on morphological variability and role of stream power distribution pattern, Yamuna River, western India",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Understanding the controls on the morphological variability of river systems constitutes one of the fundamental questions in geomorphic investigation. Channel morphology is an important indicator of river processes and is of significance for mapping the hydrology-ecologic connectivity in a river system and for predicting the future trajectory of river health in response to external forcings. This paper documents the spatial morphological variability and its natural and anthropogenic controls for the Yamuna River, a major tributary of the Ganga River, India. The Yamuna River runs through a major urban centre i.e. Delhi National Capital Region. The Yamuna River was divided into eight geomorphically distinct reaches on the basis of the assemblages of geomorphic units and the association of landscape, valley and floodplain settings. The morphological variability was analysed through stream power distribution and sediment load data at various stations. Stream power distribution of the Yamuna River basin is characterised by a non-linear pattern that was used to distinguish (a) high energy 'natural' upstream reaches, (b) 'anthropogenically altered', low energy middle stream reaches, and (c) 'rejuvenated' downstream reaches again with higher stream power. The relationship between stream power and channel morphology in these reaches was integrated with sediment load data to define the maximum flow efficiency (MFE) as the threshold for geomorphic transition. This analysis supports the continuity of river processes and the significance of a holistic, basin-scale approach rather than isolated local scale analysis in river studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

8,"Yao, CC",Aug 2019 ,Field Experiments of Hyporheic Flow Affected by a Clay Lens,WATER,"As a typical water exchange of surface water and groundwater, hyporheic flow widely exists in streambeds and is significantly affected by the characteristics of sediment and surface water. In this study, a low-permeability clay lens was chosen to investigate the influence of the streambed heterogeneity on the hyporheic flow at a river section of the Xin'an River in Anhui Province, China. A 2D sand tank was constructed to simulate the natural streambed including a clay lens under different velocity of surface water velocity. Heat tracing was used in this study. In particular, six analytical solutions based on the amplitude ratio and phase shift of temperatures were applied to calculate the vertical hyporheic flux. The results of the six methods ranged from -102.4 to 137.5 m/day and showed significant spatial differences. In view of the robustness of the calculations and the rationality of the results, the amplitude ratio method was much better than the phase shift method. The existence of the clay lens had a significant influence on the hyporheic flow. Results shows that the vertical hyporheic flux in the model containing a clay lens was lower than that for the blank control, and the discrepancy of the hyporheic flow field on both sides of the lens was obvious. Several abnormal flow velocity zones appeared around the clay lens where the local hyporheic flow was suppressed or generally enhanced. The hyporheic flow fields at three test points had mild changes when the lens was placed in a shallow layer of the model, indicating that the surface water velocity only affect the hyporheic flow slightly. With the increasing depth of the clay lens, the patterns of the hyporheic flow fields at all test points were very close to those of the hyporheic flow field without a clay lens, indicating that the influence of surface water velocity on hyporheic flow appeared gradually. A probable maximum depth of the clay lens was 30 to 40 cm, which approached the bottom of the model and a clay lens buried lower than this maximum would not affect the hyporheic flow any more. Influenced by the clay lens, hyporheic flow was hindered or enhanced in different regions of streambed, which was also depended on the depth of lens and surface water velocity. Introducing a two-dimensional sand tank model in a field test is an attempt to simulate a natural streambed and may positively influence research on hyporheic flow.Show less"
9,"Lee, A",May 2020 ,The Sensitivity of Hyporheic Exchange to Fractal Properties of Riverbeds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange in riverbeds is driven by current-bed topography interactions. Because riverbeds exhibit topographic roughness across scales, from individual grains to bedforms and bars, they can exhibit fractal patterns. This study analyzed the influence of fractal properties of riverbed topography on hyporheic exchange. A set of synthetic fractal riverbeds with different scaling statistics was used as inputs to sequentially coupled numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow and hyporheic flow. In the analysis, the maximum power spectrum (dune size) and the fractal dimension (topographic complexity) were considered as independent variables and we then investigated how interfacial fluxes and hyporheic travel times are functionally related to these variables. As the maximum power spectrum increases (i.e., dune height to flow depth ratio), the average interfacial flux increases logarithmically whereas it increases exponentially with an increase in fractal dimension. Hyporheic exchange is more sensitive to additional roughness (larger fractal dimensions) than to bedform size (larger maximum power). Our results imply that fractal properties of riverbeds are crucial to predicting hyporheic exchange. The predictive relationships we propose could be integrated with reduced complexity, large-scale models. They can also be used to design artificial topographies that target hyporheic ecosystem services.Show less"
10,"Knapp, JLA",Dec 2018 ,A Critical Assessment of Relating Resazurin-Resorufin Experiments to Reach-Scale Metabolism in Lowland Streams,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"The reactive tracer resazurin is frequently used to investigate metabolic processes and hyporheic exchange in streams, because its transformation to resorufin is considered a function of oxygen turnover in the presence of living cells and thus of ecosystem respiration. This has been investigated and confirmed in a number of laboratory and batch studies but so far not unanimously been verified in the field. In this study we conducted 13 tracer tests with resazurin in different small, low-gradient streams typical of lowland regions. We determined tracer processing rates and ratios based on metrics commonly used to assess reactive-tracer tests with resazurin and compared them to flow characteristics and respiration rates determined from diel-oxygen recordings following a two-station approach. We found no statistical relationship between tracer processing and parameters of transport, indicating that resazurin-to-resorufin transformation cannot be explained by hydrological parameters alone. The statistical relationship between resazurin processing and respiration rates based on diel-oxygen profiles was strongest if resazurin-to-resorufin transformation ratios were used, and uptake lengths were also found to be a good proxy. However, the relationships were not linear, and weak for individual streams, contrary to what was expected based on previous laboratory and batch studies. We attribute this finding to a lack of process understanding of resazurin reactions under field conditions, and generally insignificant hyporheic exchange fluxes in lowland streams. Our findings highlight important limitations of the tracer technique under field conditions.Plain Language Summary Resazurin is a compound that can be used to track the flow of water and metabolic processes in rivers. This has been tested in laboratory experiments before, but until now the method has not been fully verified in the field. In this study we apply resazurin to 13 different small rivers and measure its transformation. We compare our results to other, independent methods that are often used to determine metabolic processes. We find good relationships between the two different methods for all rivers together, but not for individual rivers. Also, the relationships are not linear, which makes predicting metabolic rates from the transformation of resazurin difficult.Show less"
11,"Karim, F",Nov 15 2014 ,Modelling hydrological connectivity of tropical floodplain wetlands via a combined natural and artificial stream network,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The ecological condition and biodiversity values of floodplain wetlands are highly dependent on the hydrological connectivity of wetlands to adjacent rivers. This paper describes a method for quantifying connectivity between floodplain wetlands and the main rivers in a wet tropical catchment of northern Australia. We used a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate time-varying water depths across the stream network (i.e. rivers, streams and man-made drains). The timing and duration of connectivity of seven wetlands (four natural and three artificial) with the two main rivers in the catchment were then calculated for different hydrological conditions. Location and areal extent of the wetlands and the stream network were identified using high-resolution laser altimetry, and these data formed key inputs to the hydrodynamic model. The model was calibrated using measured water depths and discharges across the floodplain. An algorithm was developed to identify contiguous water bodies at daily time steps, and this gave the temporal history of connection and disconnection between wetlands and the rivers. Simulation results show that connectivity of individual wetlands to both rivers varies from 26 to 365days during an average hydrological condition. Location, especially proximity to a main river, and wetland type (natural stream or artificial drain) were identified as key factors influencing these levels of connectivity. Some natural wetlands maintain connection with the river for most or all of the year, whereas the connectivity of some artificial wetlands varies from 26 to 36days according to their patterns of network connection to adjacent rivers - a result that has important implications for the accessibility of these types of wetland to aquatic biota. Using readily available river gauge data, we also show how connectivity modelling can be used to identify periods when connectivity has fallen below critical thresholds for fish movement. These connectivity patterns within the floodplain network are central to the setting of river flows that will meet environmental requirements for biota that use floodplain wetlands during their life history.

12,"Bonada, N",Mar 2006 ,Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and macrohabitat connectivity in Mediterranean-climate streams of northern California,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Drought leads to a loss of longitudinal and lateral hydrologic connectivity, which causes direct or indirect changes in stream ecosystem properties. Changes in macrohabitat availability from a riffle-pool sequence to isolated pools are among the most conspicuous consequences of connectivity loss. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were compared among 3 distinct stream macrohabitats (riffles [R], pools connected to riffles [Pc], disconnected pools [Pd]) of 19 Mediterranean-climate sites in northern California to examine the influence of loss of habitat resulting from drought disturbance. At the time of sampling, 10 sites were perennial and included R and Pc macrohabitats, whereas 9 sites were intermittent and included only Pd macrohabitats. Taxa richness was more variable in Pd, and taxa richness was significantly lower in Pd than in Pc but not R. These results suggested a decline in richness between Pc and Pd that might be associated with loss of connectivity. Lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness relative to Odonata, Coleoptera, and Heteroptera (OCH) richness was observed for Pd than R and Pc macrohabitats. Family composition was more similar between R and Pc than between R or Pc and Pd macrohabitats. This similarity may be associated with greater connectivity between R and Pc macrohabitats. Correspondence analysis indicated that macroinvertebrate composition changed along a gradient from R to Pc and Pd that was related to a perennial-intermittent gradient across sites. High variability among macroinvertebrate assemblages in Pd could have been related to variability in the duration of intermittency. In cluster analysis, macroinvertebrate assemblages were grouped by macrohabitat first and then by site, suggesting that the macrohabitat filter had a greater influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages than did local site characteristics. Few taxa were found exclusively in Pc, and this macrohabitat shared numerous taxa with R and Pd, indicating that Pc may act as a bridge between R and Pd during drought. Drought is regarded as a ramp disturbance, but our results suggest that the response of macroinvertebrate assemblages to the loss of hydrological connectivity among macrohabitats is gradual, at least in Mediterranean-climate streams where drying is gradual. However, the changes may be more dramatic in and and semiarid streams or in Mediterranean-climate streams if drying is rapid.Show less"
13,"Addy, K",Jun 19 2019 ,Connectivity and Nitrate Uptake Potential of Intermittent Streams in the Northeast USA,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Non-perennial streams dominate the extent of stream networks worldwide. Intermittent streams can provide ecosystem services to the entire network- including nitrate uptake to alleviate eutrophication of coastal waters-and are threatened by lack of legal protection. We examined 12 intermittent streams in the temperate, humid climate of the Northeast USA. Over 3 years of monitoring, continuous flow was observed a median of 277 d yr(-1), with no-flow conditions from early summer into fall. Estimated median discharge was 2.9 L s(-1) or 0.36 d(-1) mm All intermittent streams originated from source wetlands (median area: 0.27 ha) and the median length of the intermittent stream from the source wetland to the downstream perennial stream was 344 m. Through regional geospatial analysis with high resolution orthophotography, we estimated that widely available, ""high resolution"" (1:24,000) hydrography databases (e.g., NHDPlus HR) only displayed 43% of the total number of intermittent streams. Whole-stream gross nitrate-N uptake rates were estimated at six intermittent streams during continuous flow conditions using pulse additions of nitrate and a conservative tracer. These rates displayed high temporal variability (range: no detect to over 6,000 mg N m(-1) d(-1)); hot moments were noted in nine of the 65 pulse additions. Whole-stream gross nitrate-N uptake rates were significantly inversely related to discharge, with no measurable rates above 7 L s(-1). Temperature was significantly positively correlated with whole-stream gross nitrate-N uptake rates, with more hot moments in the spring. Microbial assays demonstrated that nitrate cycling in intermittent streams are consistent with results from low order, perennial forested streams and highlighted the importance of debris dams and pools-potential locations for transient storage. Our assessment suggests that intermittent streams in our region may annually contribute 24-47% of the flow to perennial streams and potentially remove 4.1 to 80.4 kg nitrate-N km(-2) annually. If development in these areas continues, perennial streams are in danger of losing a portion of their headwaters and potential nitrate uptake areas may become nitrate sources to downstream areas. These results argue to manage fluvial systems with a holistic approach that couples intermittent and perennial components.Show less"
14,"Lin, YC",Sep 2003 ,Incorporating transient storage in conjunctive stream-aquifer modeling,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"There has been growing interest in incorporating the transient storage effect into modeling solute transport in streams. In particular, for a smaller mountain stream where flow is fast and the flow field is irregular (a favorable environment to induce dead zones along the stream), long tails are normally observed in the stream tracer data, and adding transient storage terms in the advection-dispersion transport equation can result in more accurate simulation. While previous studies on transient storage modeling account for temporary, localized exchange between the stream and the shallow groundwater in the hyporheic zone, larger-scale exchange with the groundwater in the underlying aquifer has rarely been included or properly coupled to surface water modeling. In this paper, we complement previous modeling efforts by incorporating the transient storage concept in a conjunctive stream-aquifer model. Three well-documented and widely used USGS models have been coupled to form the core of this conjunctive model: MODFLOW handles the groundwater flow in the aquifer; DAFLOW accurately computes unsteady streamflow by means of the diffusive wave routing technique, as well as stream-aquifer exchange simulated as streambed leakage; and MOOD computes solute transport in the groundwater zone. In addition, an explicit finite difference package was developed to incorporate the one-dimensional transient storage equations for solute transport in streams. The quadratic upstream interpolation (QUICK) algorithm is employed to improve the accuracy of spatial differencing. An adaptive stepsize control algorithm for the Runge-Kutta method is incorporated to increase overall model efficiency. Results show that the conjunctive stream-aquifer model with transient storage can handle well the bank storage effect under a flooding event. When it is applied over a stream network, the results also show that the stream-aquifer interaction acts as a strong source or sink along the stream and is too significant to be ignored. The adaptive stepsize control for stream solute transport improves overall model performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
15,"Oram, LL",Jun 1 2010 ,Selenium Biogeochemical Cycling and Fluxes in the Hyporheic Zone of a Mining-Impacted Stream,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"The influence of hyporheic exchange on selenium (Se) biogeochemistry and mobility in sediments is unknown. A multiscale investigation of Se biogeochemistry in the hyporheic zone of East Mill Creek (EMC), southeastern Idaho, USA, was performed using in situ surface water and pore water geochemical measurements, a field-based stream tracer test and energy-dependent micro synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (mu-SXRF) measurements of Se speciation in sediments. The active hyporheic zone was determined to be 12 +/- 3 cm. Pore water redox profiles indicated that a transition to suboxic conditions begins at approximately 6 cm. Modeling pore water Se and solid phase analysis suggested Se uptake is occurring. Micro-SXRF analysis of sediments showed reduced elemental Se or selenides throughout the profile and selenite in surface sediments, Field geochemical measurements and microscale analysis both support the hypothesis that reduction in the hyporheic zone promotes sequestration of surface water Se.Show less"
16,"Nguyen, C",Dec 2021 ,A dynamic connectivity metric for complex river wetlands,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Surface water connectivity between rivers and floodplain lakes is essential to maintain biodiversity and ecological functioning in floodplain wetlands. This study proposes a method to analyze the spatial and temporal connectivity using hydraulic modeling and freely available remote sensing data. A novel dynamic connectivity metric introduced here accounts for the entire flow path, which can be a substitute for flow connectivity indicators and statistical connectivity indicators. The metric allows comparing the hydrological connectivity between different phases of a flood event, between different flood events, and potentially between different catchments. The method was applied to the Northern Lakes of the Narran River catchment in New South Wales, Australia. The results indicate that there is no clear transition in the connectivity between different stages of a flood event in the flat Narran River wetland compared with other wetlands connecting to deeper river channels. Thus, the proposed metric brings a more comprehensive observation on hydrological connectivity in floodplain wetlands than previously developed metrics, which is expected to further support ecological and water management studies in river catchments.Show less"
17,"Le Lay, H",Dec 2019 ,Characterization of Diffuse Groundwater Inflows into Stream Water (Part II: Quantifying Groundwater Inflows by Coupling FO-DTS and Vertical Flow Velocities),WATER,"Temperature has been used to characterize groundwater and stream water exchanges for years. One of the many methods used analyzes propagation of the atmosphere-influenced diurnal signal in sediment to infer vertical velocities. However, despite having good accuracy, the method is usually limited by its small spatial coverage. The appearance of fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) provided new possibilities due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. Methods based on the heat-balance equation, however, cannot quantify diffuse groundwater inflows that do not modify stream temperature. Our research approach consists of coupling groundwater inflow mapping from a previous article (Part I) and deconvolution of thermal profiles in the sediment to obtain vertical velocities along the entire reach. Vertical flows were calculated along a 400 m long reach, and a period of 9 months (October 2016 to June 2017), by coupling a fiber optic cable buried in thalweg sediment and a few thermal lances at the water-sediment interface. When compared to predictions of hyporheic discharge by traditional methods (differential discharge between upstream and downstream of the monitored reach and the mass-balance method), those of our method agreed only for the low-flow period and the end of the high-flow period. Our method underestimated hyporheic discharge during high flow. We hypothesized that the differential discharge and mass-balance methods included lateral inflows that were not detected by the fiber optic cable buried in thalweg sediment. Increasing spatial coverage of the cable as well as automatic and continuous calculation over the reach may improve predictions during the high-flow period. Coupling groundwater inflow mapping and vertical hyporheic flow allows flow to be quantified continuously, which is of great interest for characterizing and modeling fine hyporheic processes over long periods.Show less"
18,"Claret, C",Feb 2009 ,Integrating hydraulic conductivity with biogeochemical gradients and microbial activity along river-groundwater exchange zones in a subtropical stream,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"The pervious lateral bars (parafluvial zone) and beds (hyporheic zone), where stream water and groundwater exchange, are dynamic sites of hydrological and biological retention. The significance of these biogeochemical `hotspots' to stream and groundwater metabolism is largely controlled by filtration capacity, defined as the extent to which subsurface flowpaths and matrix hydraulic conductivity modify water characteristics. Where hydraulic conductivity is high, gradients in biogeochemistry and microbial activity along subsurface flowpaths were hypothesized to be less marked than where hydraulic conductivity is low. This hypothesis was tested in two riffles and gravel bars in an Australian subtropical stream. At one site, gradients in chemical and microbial variables along flowpaths were associated with reduced hydraulic conductivity, longer water residence time and reduced filtration capacity compared with the second site where filtration capacity was greater and longitudinal biogeochemical trends were dampened. These results imply that factors affecting the sediment matrix in this subtropical stream can alter filtration capacity, interstitial microbial activity and biogeochemical gradients along subsurface flowpaths. This hydroecological approach also indicates potential for a simple field technique to estimate filtration capacity and predict the prevailing hyporheic gradients in microbial activity and biogeochemical processing efficiency, with significant implications for stream ecosystem function.Show less"
19,"Colvin, ME",May 2009 ,EVALUATION OF IRRIGATION CANAL NETWORKS TO ASSESS STREAM CONNECTIVITY IN A WATERSHED,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"We used digital data sets, aerial photos and direct field observations in a geographical information system to evaluate the stream habitat in an Idaho watershed affected by agriculture. We found that the scale of the digital data sets affected the outcome of the assessment due to the presence of dewatered stream channels in the drainage. We analysed the spatial configuration of irrigation canals in the watershed to determine if the contemporary stream network connectivity could be attributed to human-caused or to natural hydrological processes. Many irrigation canals were significantly longer than would have been expected if these canals were constructed to capture water from the closest portion of the abandoned stream channels. Our findings provide evidence that some of these tributary streams had reaches that were likely ephemeral or intermittent at the time of canal construction. Our approach for assessing stream and irrigation network connectivity in pastoral and agricultural lands should aid managers in prioritizing the effective and appropriate reconnection efforts.

20,"Frei, S",Oct 24 2019 ,Occurence of microplastics in the hyporheic zone of rivers,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Although recent studies indicate that fluvial systems can be accumulation areas for microplastics (MPs), the common perception still treats rivers and streams primarily as pure transport vectors for MPs. In this study we investigate the occurrence of MPs in a yet unnoticed but essential compartment of fluvial ecosystems - the hyporheic zone (HZ). Larger MP particles (500-5,000 mu m) were detected using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) - Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Our analysis of MPs (500-5,000 mu m) in five freeze cores extracted for the Roter Main River sediments (Germany) showed that MPs were detectable down to a depth of 0.6 m below the streambed in low abundances (<< 1 particle per kg dry weight). Additionally, one core was analyzed as an example for smaller MPs (20-500 mu m) with focal plane array (FPA)- based mu FTIR spectroscopy. Highest MP abundances (similar to 30,000 particles per kg dry weight) were measured for pore scale particles (20-50 mu m). The detected high abundances indicate that the HZ can be a significant accumulation area for pore scale MPs (20-50 mu m), a size fraction that yet is not considered in literature. As the HZ is known as an important habitat for invertebrates representing the base of riverine food webs, aquatic food webs can potentially be threatened by the presence of MPs in the HZ. Hyporheic exchange is discussed as a potential mechanism leading to a transfer of pore scale MPs from surface flow into streambed sediments and as a potential vector for small MPs to enter the local aquifer. MPs in the HZ therefore may be a potential risk for drinking water supplies, particularly during drinking water production via river bank filtration.Show less"
21,"Huang, P",Nov-dec 2018 ,Empirical Equations to Predict the Characteristics of Hyporheic Exchange in a Pool-Riffle Sequence,GROUNDWATER,"The hyporheic zone is the saturated interstitial space surrounding a stream. Water actively moves into, through, and out of the hyporheic zone, resulting in hyporheic exchange (HE), which is crucial to the physicochemical and biological processes in these systems. The HE in pool-riffle sequences is one of the most common forms of HE and has received a vast amount of attention. This study aimed to derive empirical equations to predict the scale, median residence time (RT), and flux of HE in a single pool-riffle sequence by considering stream discharge, bedform geometry, streambed hydraulic conductivity, and groundwater flow. The resulting equations, which were derived using previously published data, allow quick approximations of the mean depth, median RT, and flux of HE in a single pool-riffle sequence. Therefore, these equations can be used to conveniently and efficiently generate insights into the physicochemical and biological processes, facilitating the prediction of water quality and the restoration of HE in stream rehabilitation. The overall framework of the derived equations is also generally applicable to considering HE with additional influential factors (e.g., stream width, sinuosity, bed slope, alluvial depth) and cases with more available data.Show less"
22,"Rodeles, AA",2020 ,"Barriers to longitudinal river connectivity: review of impacts, study methods and management for Iberian fish conservation",LIMNETICA,"River connectivity is essential for the correct functioning of freshwater ecosystems at all scales. However, it has not received the necessary attention by researchers, managers and policymakers until recent years. In this review, we recap the state of knowledge in river connectivity and its applications to conservation. We describe the particular characteristics of river connectivity and summarise the effects of its interruption in different freshwater ecosystem elements. We then focus on the effects of the lack of segment connectivity in fish species and review the different methods developed to study it. The application of connectivity in freshwater fish conservation areas is also reviewed, which highlights the lack of studies on this subject. Finally, connectivity restoration is studied. The review addresses these topics in a general way and then focus on the Iberian Peninsula. The Iberian Peninsula is an interesting place to study river connectivity because it has one of the highest numbers of dams per square kilometre and a large number of endemic and endangered freshwater fish species. Despite the high number of fish species affected by water extraction and damming, river connectivity and its effect in Iberian freshwater fish populations have not been well studied. A small number of studies analyse the effect of small dams in nearby fish communities, but large-scale impact assessments are scarce. More connectivity analyses are needed to improve freshwater ecosystem conservation strategies. We conclude addressing some gaps in the knowledge of fragmentation and research opportunities in river connectivity and conservation.Show less"
23,"Denison, CD",Feb 2021 ,Incorporating Network Connectivity into Stream Classification Frameworks,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Stream classification frameworks are important tools for conserving aquatic resources. Yet despite their utility, most classification frameworks have not incorporated network connectivity. We developed and compared three biologically informed stream classification frameworks considering the effects of variables indexing local habitat and/or connectivity on stream fish communities. The first framework classified streams according to local environmental variables largely following the precedent set by previous stream classifications. The second framework classified streams according solely to network connectivity variables, while the third framework considered both local and connectivity variables. Using fish community data from 291 wadeable streams in South Carolina, USA, we used conditional inference tree analyses to identify either seven or eight discrete types of wadeable streams within each framework. Classifications were evaluated on their ability to describe community composition at a subset of sites not used in model training, and canonical correspondence analysis suggested that each framework performed similarly in describing overall community variation, with about 19% of variation explained. After accounting for the effects of biogeography and land use in our analytical approach, each classification explained a substantially higher amount of community variation with 46% of variation explained by our connectivity-informed classification and 42% explained by our locally informed classification. Classifications differed in their ability to describe elements of community structure; a classification incorporating connectivity predicted species richness better than the one that did not. This study ultimately addresses an important knowledge gap in the classification literature while providing broader implications for the conservation of aquatic organisms and their habitats.Show less"

More frequent and severe droughts associated with climate change are poised to significantly alter flow intermittence patterns and hydrologic connectivity in dryland streams of the American Southwest, with deleterious effects on highly endangered fishes. By integrating local-scale hydrologic modeling with emerging approaches in landscape ecology, we quantify fine-resolution, watershed-scale changes in habitat size, spacing, and connectance under forecasted climate change in the Verde River Basin, United States. Model simulations project annual zero-flow day frequency to increase by 27% by midcentury, with differential seasonal consequences on continuity (temporal continuity at discrete locations) and connectivity (spatial continuity within the network). A 17% increase in the frequency of stream drying events is expected throughout the network with associated increases in the duration of these events. Flowing portions of the river network will diminish between 8% and 20% in spring and early summer and become increasingly isolated by more frequent and longer stretches of dry channel fragments, thus limiting the opportunity for native fishes to access spawning habitats and seasonally available refuges. Model predictions suggest that midcentury and late century climate will reduce network-wide hydrologic connectivity for native fishes by 6-9% over the course of a year and up to 12-18% during spring spawning months. Our work quantifies climate-induced shifts in stream drying and connectivity across a large river network and demonstrates their implications for the persistence of a globally endemic fish fauna.Show less"
25,"Peterson, RN",Jan 20 2010 ,Evaluating groundwater discharge to tidal rivers based on a Rn-222 time-series approach,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"The natural flux of groundwater into coastal water bodies has recently been shown to contribute significant quantities of nutrients and trace metals to the coastal ocean. Groundwater discharge and hyporheic exchange to estuaries and rivers, however, is frequently overlooked though it often carries a distinctly different chemical signature than surface waters. Most studies that attempt to quantify this input to rivers use multiple geochemical tracers. However, these studies are often limited in their spatial and temporal extents because of the labor-intensive nature of integrating multiple measurement techniques. We describe here a method of using a single tracer, Rn-222, to rapidly characterize groundwater discharge into tidally-influenced rivers and streams. In less than one week of fieldwork, we determined that of six streams that empty into the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, three (Eau Gallie River, Turkey Creek, and Main Canal) did not receive substantial groundwater inputs, one canal (C-25 Canal) was dominated by groundwater exchange, and the remaining two (Sebastian River system and Crane Creek) fell somewhere in between. For more detailed discharge assessments, we focused on the Sebastian River system, a stratified tidal river estuary, during a relatively dry period (June) and a wet period July) in 2008. Using time-series 222Rn and current velocity measurements we found that groundwater discharge into all three branches of the Sebastian River increased by 1-2 orders of magnitude during the wetter period. The estimated groundwater flow rates were higher than those reported into the adjacent IRL, suggesting that discharge into these rivers can be more important than direct discharge into the IRL The techniques employed here should work equally well in other river/stream systems that experience significant groundwater discharge. Such assessments would allow area managers to quickly assess the distribution and magnitude of groundwater discharge nature into rivers over large spatial ranges. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

26,"Knapp, JLA",Jun 2017 ,Determination of hyporheic travel time distributions and other parameters from concurrent conservative and reactive tracer tests by local-in-global optimization,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The complexity of hyporheic flow paths requires reach-scale models of solute transport in streams that are flexible in their representation of the hyporheic passage. We use a model that couples advective-dispersive in-stream transport to hyporheic exchange with a shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times. The model also accounts for two-site sorption and transformation of reactive solutes. The coefficients of the model are determined by fitting concurrent stream-tracer tests of conservative (fluorescein) and reactive (resazurin/resorufin) compounds. The flexibility of the shape-free models give rise to multiple local minima of the objective function in parameter estimation, thus requiring global-search algorithms, which is hindered by the large number of parameter values to be estimated. We present a local-in-global optimization approach, in which we use a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method as global-search method to estimate a set of in-stream and hyporheic parameters. Nested therein, we infer the shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times by a local Gauss-Newton method. The overall approach is independent of the initial guess and provides the joint posterior distribution of all parameters. We apply the described local-in-global optimization method to recorded tracer breakthrough curves of three consecutive stream sections, and infer section-wise hydraulic parameter distributions to analyze how hyporheic exchange processes differ between the stream sections.Plain Language Summary Compounds, dissolved in river water, are transported along the river, but also to some extent into the sediments and back into the river. While being in the sediments, they may react. In reactive stream-tracer tests, we add easy-to-detect reactive compounds into a stream and measure time-series of concentration in the river further downstream. We present an approach of analyzing such tracer tests in a flexible, yet reliable manner, which also provides the uncertainty of our interpretation. This can be useful in the assessment of river-water qualityShow less"
27,"Mendoza-Lera, C",Feb 1 2017 ,Relating hydraulic conductivity and hyporheic zone biogeochemical processing to conserve and restore river ecosystem services,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River management practices commonly attempt to improve habitat and ecological functioning (e.g. biogeochemical processing or retention of pollutants) by restoring hydrological exchange with the hyporheic zone (i.e. hyporheic flow) in an effort to increase mass transfer of solutes (nutrients, carbon and electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrate). However, even when hyporheic flow is increased, often no significant changes in biogeochemical processing are detected. Some of these apparent paradox result from the simplistic assumption that there is a direct relationship between hyporheic flow and biogeochemical processing. We propose an alternative conceptual model that hyporheic flow is non-linearly related with biogeochemical processing. Based on the different solute mass transfer and area available for colonization among hydraulic conductivities, we hypothesize that biogeochemical processing in the hyporheic zone follows a Gaussian function depending on hyporheic hydraulic conductivity. After presenting the conceptual model and its domain of application, we discuss the potential implications, notably for river restoration and further hyporheic research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

28,"Harvey, JW",Jan 7 2021 ,The River Corridor's Evolving Connectivity of Lotic and Lentic Waters,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"River corridors supply a substantial proportion of the fresh water for societal and ecological needs. Individual functions of flowing (lotic) streams and rivers and ponded (lentic) waterbodies such as lakes and reservoirs are well-studied, but their collective functions are not as well understood. Here we bring together nationally consistent river corridor datasets to characterize the contributions of lotic and lentic features and to estimate changes over the past centuries. High-resolution datasets describing waterbodies across 10 million kilometers of the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) river network were classified by waterbody type and origin (historic vs. human-made or intensively managed), surface areal coverage, and degree of connectivity as estimated by a change in water residence timescale in river corridors. Four centuries of human disturbance drove large swings in river corridor makeup, with a transition toward more lotic systems caused by beaver extirpation and abandonment of waterwheel mill ponds by end of the nineteenth century. The twentieth century saw a vast expansion (49%) in river corridor areal coverage resulting from construction and management of small ponds and reservoirs for drinking water, hydropower, irrigation and livestock watering, and stormwater control. Water residence timescale in river corridors doubled or quadrupled over large areas, and more in specific locations, during the twentieth century as a result of the increased coverage of reservoirs and managed small ponds. Although reservoirs and lakes now dominate river corridor surface areas, we found that the growing number of small ponds impacts a greater proportion of network length through their influence on headwater streams where most water and chemical runoff enters the river corridor. We close with an agenda for integrated modeling of the physical, biogeochemical, and ecological drivers of river corridor functions, trajectories of change, and management opportunities.Show less"
29,"Song, JX",Apr 14 2007 ,Effects of hyporheic processes on streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity in three rivers of Nebraska,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Streambed hydraulic conductivity is of great importance in the analysis of stream-aquifer interactions and stream ecosystems. We investigated streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) with two connected depths in three rivers of Nebraska. Our results demonstrated that streambed K-v in the upper sediment layer was much higher than that in the sediment of the lower layer. We speculate that hyporheic processes can result in larger streambed K-v in the upper layer. Specifically, water exchange through upwelling and downwelling zones can lead to bigger pore spaces and a more unconsolidated structure of sediments in the upper layer. The upward movement of gas produced by redox processes can loosen the sediments and further enlarge pore spaces in the upper layers. Also, permeability can increase as a result of expanded pore spaces caused by invertebrate activities in the upper part of streambed. The higher K-v will likely enhance exchange processes between stream and sediments.Show less"
30,"Lehr, C",Aug 2015 ,A novel method to evaluate the effect of a stream restoration on the spatial pattern of hydraulic connection of stream and groundwater,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Stream restoration aims at an enhancement of ecological habitats, an increase of water retention within a landscape and sometimes even at an improvement of biogeochemical functions of lotic ecosystems. For the latter, good exchange between groundwater and stream water is often considered to be of major importance. In this study hydraulic connectivity between river and aquifer was investigated for a four years period, covering the restoration of an old oxbow after the second year. The oxbow became reconnected to the stream and the clogging layer in the oxbow was excavated. We expected increasing hydraulic connectivity between oxbow and aquifer after restoration of the stream, and decreasing hydraulic connectivity for the former shortcut due to increased clogging. To test that hypothesis, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the coupled groundwater-stream water system before and after the restoration were analysed by principal component analyses of time series of groundwater heads and stream water levels. The first component depicted between 53% and 70% of the total variance in the dataset for the different years. It captured the propagation of the pressure signal induced by stream water level fluctuations throughout the adjacent aquifer. Thus it could be used as a measure of hydraulic connectivity between stream and aquifer. During the first year, the impact of stream water level fluctuations decreased with distance from the regulated river (shortcut), whereas the hydraulic connection of the oxbow to the adjacent aquifer was very low. After restoration of the stream we observed a slight but not significant increase of hydraulic connectivity in the oxbow in the second year after restoration, but no change for the former shortcut. There is some evidence that the pattern of hydraulic connectivity at the study site is by far more determined by the natural heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivities of the floodplain sediments and the initial construction of the shortcut rather than by the clogging layer in the oxbow.

31,"Cornut, J",2012 ,Coarse particulate organic matter in the interstitial zone of three French headwater streams,ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"Headwater woodland streams are primarily heterotrophic: they receive substantial inputs of organic matter from the riparian vegetation, while autochthonous primary production is generally low. A substantial part of leaf litter entering running waters may be buried in the streambed because of flooding and sediment movement. Although the general significance of the hyporheic zone for stream metabolism has been reported early, organic matter storage within the sediment of streams has received less attention, with most studies only quantifying accumulations at the streambed surface and ignoring other stream compartments. In the present study, the amounts of three fractions of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM; > 16, 4-16 and 1-4 mm) were determined in late autumn and early spring in the interstitial and benthic zones of three headwater streams of the Montagne Noire (South-Western France) differing in their substratum grain size. Our findings demonstrated that the total CPOM content in the interstitial zone can be much (up to one order of magnitude) higher than at the sediment surface. The sandy bottomed stream exhibited a higher amount of CPOM (whatever the size fraction) than the two other streams, suggesting that the sediment particle size may be a major determinant of CPOM storage. Given the large amount of organic matter stored in the interstitial zone, this compartment may play an important role for the carbon turnover and associated trophic dynamics in the stream ecosystem.Show less"

Recent studies have quantified stream/substream interactions using models of transient storage. These studies are based on tracer-dilution data obtained during periods of steady flow. We present a modeling framework for the analysis of transient storage in stream systems with unsteady flows. The framework couples a kinematic wave routing model with a solute transport model that includes transient storage. The routing model provides time-varying flows and cross-sectional areas that are used as input to the solute transport model.The modeling framework was used to quantify stream/substream interaction in Huey Creek, an Antarctic stream fed exclusively by glacial meltwater. Analysis of tracer-dilution data indicates that there was substantial interaction between the flowing surface water and the hyporheic (substream) zone. The ratio of storage zone area to stream cross-sectional area (A(S)/A) was >1 in all stream reaches, indicating that the substream area contributing to hyporheic exchange was large relative to stream cross-sectional area. The rate of exchange, as governed by the transient storage exchange coefficient (alpha), was rapid because of a high stream gradient and porous alluvial materials. Estimates of alpha generally exceed those determined for other small streams. The high degree of hyporheic exchange supports the hypothesis that weathering reactions within the hyporheos account for observed increases in solute concentration with stream length as noted in other studies of Antarctic streams.Show less"
33,"BOULTON, AJ",Jul 1995 ,HYPORHEIC PROCESSES DURING FLOODING AND DRYING IN A SONORAN DESERT STREAM .2. FAUNAL DYNAMICS,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Spatial and temporal changes in assemblage structure of the hyporheos of a Sonoran Desert stream were monitored after re-wetting occurred in winter at three sites with different flow regimens. Diverse assemblages of hyporheic invertebrates were found at all sites within two days of re-wetting. At two sites, drying represented a gradual press disturbance to the hyporheos, altering the assemblage composition from a predominance of cyclopoid copepods and chironomids to one dominated by microturbellarians, ceratopogonid larvae, ostracods, nematodes, and, just before the hyporheic zone dried, several species of water mites. There were fewest hyporheic taxa at the most intermittent site where cyclopoid copepods were most numerous. The site that remained inundated during the entire study harbored a speciose hyporheos whose composition varied vertically and laterally. Amphipods, isopods, and bathynellaceans were found in the ''phreatic'' (deeper than 50 cm) zone whereas cyclopoids, cladocerans, chironomids, and water mites were common in the ''shallow'' (< 50 cm) hyporheic habitat. In wells sunk in the stream bank, nematodes, ostracods, and bathynellaceans characterized the ''parafluvial'' zone. Spates temporarily altered the assemblage composition of the parafluvial and shallow hyporheic habitats but recovery was rapid, implying a resilient fauna. Phreatic assemblages were not immediately influenced by spates. At the scale of an individual reach (122 m), a distinct longitudinal pattern in assemblage composition was correlated with trends in water chemistry and the gradual transition from zones of hyporheic upwelling (discharge) to downwelling (recharge). Upwelling areas were nitrate-rich, hypoxic, and harbored a typically ''phreatic'' fauna whereas downwelling zones were well-oxygenated, low in nitrate, and were characterized by taxa found in the shallow hyporheos. This longitudinal pattern was consistent over time but became truncated as surface water receded upstream, altering the exchange of surface and subsurface water. Recognition of temporal changes in the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal variation in subsurface biota and how they respond to surficial hydrologic extremes is essential to understanding the way these subsystems interact with the surface stream ecosystem; the next goal is to determine the causes of these patterns.Show less"
34,"Baskaran, S",2009 ,"Time-series measurements of stream and sediment temperature for understanding river-groundwater interactions: Border Rivers and Lower Richmond catchments, Australia",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES,"Monitoring of temperature in the stream sediment (0.25-1.2 m depth) as well as the stream itself was used to investigate groundwater-surface water interactions in two different Australian catchments (Border Rivers and Lower Richmond). When interpreted with hydrographic and hydraulic conductivity data, the temperature monitoring provided useful insights into the spatial and temporal variability of stream-aquifer connectivity. At one site, sediment temperatures fluctuated with the diurnal temperature variation of the stream, reflecting river leakage (losing conditions). No diurnal signal was detected in the sediment temperatures at other sites, which is a typical indicator of gaining conditions. However, with water-level measurements indicating negative gradients and the stream sediments dominated by clay at these sites, this lack of sediment temperature variability is interpreted to reflect very low rates of downward seepage. At one site, a transition from gaining to losing conditions was observed through time. In the field trials, operational issues such as timing the monitoring to coincide with reasonable diurnal variations of stream temperature, the requirement of understanding the shallow stratigraphy of the stream bed and separating out localised effects (such as weirs) were highlighted. The trials also highlighted that interpretation of the temperature data can be ambiguous when viewed in isolation. Results indicated that time-series measurements of sediment and stream temperatures can be a useful screening tool for identifying gaining and losing reaches and for identifying temporal variations in seepage flux. It is suggested that temperature loggers can be readily and cheaply incorporated into existing hydrographic networks to provide a greater understanding of stream-aquifer connectivity. It is also recommended that existing routine temperature logging (such as with pressure transducers) be upgraded to sufficient accuracy for seepage studies. Temperature monitoring would be particularly useful in estimating seepage from Australian ephemeral streams. These data also have relevance to the investigation and management of aquatic ecosystems, notably in the hyporheic zone.Show less"

A test of two catchments,WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL,"Catchment-scale river reconnection programmes require barrier inventories for restoration planning, yet barrier inventories are variable in extent and quality internationally. To test the degree to which barrier databases, in this case for England, are fit for purpose, we made a comparison of the national database (mostly originating from desk-study) for two catchments, the Wear and the Tees, against detailed walkover surveys. We surveyed 701 km (32.8%) of stream length, stratified by stream order, altitude and subcatchment and recorded natural and artificial barriers. Only 22.7% of barriers identified in the walkover survey were present in the national database, including low-head (<5 m) artificial structures (32.3% representation), artificial barriers >= 5 m (14.3% representation) and culverts (0% representation). About 18.9% of artificial barriers in the national database were found, during a field survey, to have been breached naturally. Mean densities of artificial barriers were 0.68 barriers km(-1) and 0.45 barriers km(-1) in the Wear and Tees, respectively, significantly higher than in the national database. Stream connectivity restoration in England may be hampered by the incomplete national barrier inventory; we recommend careful checks of barrier inventories as they are developed internationally.Show less"
36,"Hall, RO",Jan 2016 ,"Metabolism, Gas Exchange, and Carbon Spiraling in Rivers",ECOSYSTEMS,"Ecosystem metabolism, that is, gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), controls organic carbon (OC) cycling in stream and river networks and is expected to vary predictably with network position. However, estimates of metabolism in small streams outnumber those from rivers such that there are limited empirical data comparing metabolism across a range of stream and river sizes. We measured metabolism in 14 rivers (discharge range 14-84 m(3) s(-1)) in the Western and Midwestern United States (US). We estimated GPP, ER, and gas exchange rates using a Lagrangian, 2-station oxygen model solved in a Bayesian framework. GPP ranged from 0.6-22 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and ER tracked GPP, suggesting that autotrophic production supports much of riverine ER in summer. Net ecosystem production, the balance between GPP and ER was 0 or greater in 4 rivers showing autotrophy on that day. River velocity and slope predicted gas exchange estimates from these 14 rivers in agreement with empirical models. Carbon turnover lengths (that is, the distance traveled before OC is mineralized to CO2) ranged from 38 to 1190 km, with the longest turnover lengths in high-sediment, arid-land rivers. We also compared estimated turnover lengths with the relative length of the river segment between major tributaries or lakes; the mean ratio of carbon turnover length to river length was 1.6, demonstrating that rivers can mineralize much of the OC load along their length at baseflow. Carbon mineralization velocities ranged from 0.05 to 0.81 m d(-1), and were not different than measurements from small streams. Given high GPP relative to ER, combined with generally short OC spiraling lengths, rivers can be highly reactive with regard to OC cycling.Show less"
37,"McCallum, JL",Mar 2016 ,Residence times of stream-groundwater exchanges due to transient stream stage fluctuations,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The biogeochemical functioning of stream ecosystems is heavily dependent on water and water-borne nutrient fluxes between the stream itself and the streambed and banks (i.e., the hyporheic zone). The travel time of water exchanges through the hyporheic zone has been investigated previously; however, these studies have primarily modeled exchanges under steady state conditions assuming spatial pressure variations. This assumes that the hydraulic gradients that drive the exchanges are maintained the whole time the stream water remains in the bed or banks, which is unrealistic. Therefore, in this study we use a transient approach to investigate residence time distributions (RTDs) of bank inflow and bank outflow during both regular, diurnal stream stage variations and storm flow events. We demonstrate that RTDs reflect the timing and magnitude bank inflows, rather than smooth RTDs. We also show that small percentages of water from a given bank inflow event may be present in bank outflows for long periods of time, due to dispersion and diffusion within the bank, and lower rates of bank outflow, relative to bank inflow. This is apparent in the synthetic model of a single storm flow event, where 10% remained in the bank after 50 days. Additionally, residence times for a given bank inflow event are longer when repeated events occur, because the bank outflows from one event are interrupted by an increase in stream stage during a successive event. For example, field data capturing events of variable timing and magnitude showed that 70 days after each of three storm flow events occurred, 40, 12 and 30% of the bank inflow event remained in the banks. These cases indicate that bank exchanges are temporally dynamic and the RTDs of return flows can have significant tailing, which will dictate rates of nutrient exchange within the near-stream environment.Show less"
38,"Kemper, JT",Feb 2022 ,Sediment-ecological connectivity in a large river network,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Sediment eroded from the headwaters of a large basin strongly influences channels and ecosystems far downstream, but the connection is often difficult to trace. Disturbance-dependent riparian trees are thought to rely primarily on floods for formation of the sand bars necessary for seedling establishment, but pulses of sediment should also promote formation of such features. In order to expand understanding of the role of sediment connectivity in governing ecological processes, here we explore the hypothesis that cottonwood forest along the Green and Yampa Rivers in Utah and Colorado are dominated by trees established a century ago during a period of extensive channel migration caused by significant headwater erosion. Analysis of historical documents and aerial photographs suggests that three key tributaries of the Yampa River underwent significant historical erosion from roughly 1880 to 1940. Average width and depth of tributaries with defined arroyos increased two to six times from historical surveys, resulting in the export of similar to 30 million metric tons of sediment, sizably increasing the sediment load and channel migration rate of the Yampa and Green Rivers. Establishment of major portions of several downstream cottonwood forests occurred during this period of historical erosion, increased sediment loads, and heightened channel migration rates, and the area of forest dating to that time is much greater than can be explained by high flows alone. Viewed collectively, our findings suggest tributary erosion played a vital role in successful downstream forest establishment, a link we contend is best illustrated through a sediment-ecological connectivity framework. Broadly, this framework facilitates consideration of linkages between morphological and ecological processes at the watershed-scale. Development and utilization of a watershed-scale sediment-ecological connectivity perspective highlights the value of sediment as a critical ecological resource to be managed jointly with flow to ensure the maintenance of vital riverine ecosystems.Show less"
39,"Zimmer, MA",Feb 15 2014 ,Temporal and spatial response of hyporheic zone geochemistry to a storm event,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Although there has been recent focus on understanding spatial variability in hyporheic zone geochemistry across different morphological units under baseflow conditions, less attention has been paid to temporal responses of hyporheic zone geochemistry to non-steady-state conditions. We documented spatial and temporal variability of hyporheic zone geochemistry in response to a large-scale storm event, Tropical Storm Irene (August 2011), across a pool-riffle-pool sequence along Chittenango Creek in Chittenango, NY, USA. We sampled stream water as well as pore water at 15cm depth in the streambed at 14 locations across a 30 m reach. Sampling occurred seven times at daily intervals: once during baseflow conditions, once during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph, and five times during the receding limb. Principal component analysis was used to interpret temporal and spatial changes and dominant drivers in stream and pore water geochemistry (n=111). Results show the majority of spatial variance in hyporheic geochemistry (62%) is driven by differential mixing of stream and ground water in the hyporheic zone. The second largest driver (17%) of hyporheic geochemistry was temporal dilution and enrichment of infiltrating stream water during the storm. Hyporheic sites minimally influenced by discharging groundwater (connected' sites) showed temporal changes in water chemistry in response to the storm event. Connected sites within and upstream of the riffle reflected stream geochemistry throughout the storm, whereas downstream sites showed temporally lagged responses in some conservative and biogeochemically reactive solutes. This suggests temporal changes in hyporheic geochemistry at these locations reflect a combination of changes in infiltrating stream chemistry and hyporheic flowpath length and residence time. The portion of the study area strongly influenced by groundwater discharge increased in size throughout the storm, producing elevated Ca2+ and SO42- concentrations in the streambed, suggesting zones of localized groundwater inputs expand in response to storms.

However, transport lines have fragmented the regional landscape and disturbed the natural interplay between rivers and their floodplains. Spatial analysis using multiple buffers provides information about the potential interaction between road and stream networks and their impact on channel morphology of a small watershed in the Lower Gangetic Plain. Present study is tried to understand the lateral and longitudinal disconnection in headwater stream by rural roads with the integration of geoinformatics and field survey. Significant (p < 0.001) growth of total road length and number of road-stream crossing in the last five decades (1970s-2010s) contribute to making longitudinal and lateral disconnection in the fluvial system of Kunur River Basin. Channel geometry from ten road-stream crossings shows significant (p = 0.01) differences between upstream and downstream of crossing structure and created problems like downstream scouring, increased drop height at outlet, formation of stable bars, severe bank erosion, and make barriers for river biota. The hydro-geomorphic processes are also adversely affected due to lateral disconnection and input of fine to coarse sediments from the river side growth of unpaved road (1922%).

41,"Mermillod-Blondin, F",Jun 2015 ,Links between sediment structures and ecological processes in the hyporheic zone: ground-penetrating radar as a non-invasive tool to detect subsurface biologically active zones,ECOHYDROLOGY,"At the scale of geomorphological units (riffles, pools, and gravel bars), the contribution of the hyporheic zone to the functioning of streams and rivers depends on the hydrological exchanges between surface water and groundwater. These exchanges are largely controlled by sediment structure and texture, which are difficult to assess with classical methods (shovelling and freeze coring). We aimed to evaluate the ability of a non-destructive method, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), to detect sediment structures associated with subsurface biologically active zones in a gravel-bed river. After GPR data acquisition and processing, a three-dimensional reconstruction of a gravel bar permitted the identification of two sediment facies: a cobble/gravel lithofacies denoted as coarse' and a sand/gravel lithofacies denoted as fine'. We installed piezometers along two longitudinal profiles (each corresponding to a lithofacies identified by GPR) and monitored hydraulic head and temperature for 20days. Water and sediments were sampled along the two profiles to measure water physicochemistry, sediment characteristics, bacterial abundance and activity, and interstitial invertebrate assemblages. These measurements confirmed that the two profiles were characterized by distinct hydrological flow rates and associated biological activities. Rapid water transport in the coarse profile fuelled the hyporheic zone with organic matter, whereas water and organic matter supplies were lower in the fine profile. Consequently, the higher supply of organic matter in the coarse profile was associated with higher microbial activities and invertebrate density and diversity. Therefore, GPR could be an efficient tool to detect the sediment features playing a key role in hyporheic zone functioning. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
42,"Pacioglu, O",2017 ,The invertebrate community of the chalk stream hyporheic zone: spatio-temporal distribution patterns,KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS,"This study examined the longitudinal distribution, vertical distribution and temporal dynamics of the invertebrate community inhabiting the chalk hyporheic zone of four catchments, which differed in their degree of eutrophication and sediment composition. We characterised the invertebrate community at two depths (20 and 35 cm), in the heads and tails of riffles at low and high groundwater levels. Taxon density declined significantly with increasing depth. The abundance of invertebrates did not differ significantly between the heads and tails of riffles and also did not respond to changes in groundwater level. The results suggest that the chalk hyporheic zone is a shallow habitat that is relatively homogenous at the riffle scale with respect to the distribution of fauna and potentially resilient to seasonal groundwater level fluctuations.Show less"
43,"Pracheil, BM",Jun 2015 ,Movement through Dams Facilitates Population Connectivity in a Large River,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Even in heavily impounded river ecosystems, aquatic populations and communities retain limited connectivity via movement through dams. This connectivity has the potential to influence population dynamics but has been infrequently characterized. We used 1995-2008 paddlefish mark-recapture data to perform the following: (i) quantify rates of movement through dams and (ii) examine the influence of dam discharge on fish passing dams. We found that there are substantial one-way (upstream to downstream) population connections maintained via fish passing dams and that dam discharge is a key driver of downstream fish movement. Results of our study suggest that population connections maintained by fish passing dams can play an important role in population dynamics depleting upstream populations and subsidizing downstream populations, particularly in years with high flow events. We suggest that the influence of hydrology on maintaining populations in fragmented ecosystems is an increasingly important consideration for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems in the face of predicted hydrological changes from climate change.

44,"Sosa-Perez, G",Aug 15 2017 ,Reductions in road sediment production and road-stream connectivity from two decommissioning treatments,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"Unpaved forest roads can be an important source of sediment to streams. Road decommissioning is an increasingly common technique to eliminate these impacts, but few pre- and post-treatment studies have rigorously assessed its effectiveness. The objectives of this study in the northern Colorado Front Range were to: (1) quantify the effects of key variables on road sediment production before decommissioning; (2) quantify the changes over time in segment-scale sediment production from two decommissioning treatments (ripping only, and ripping plus mulching) versus untreated controls; and (3) quantify the factors affecting road-stream connectivity and the changes in connectivity due to decommissioning 12.3 km of roads. Median sediment production rate in the first year prior to decommissioning was 0.3 kg m(-2), but values varied from 0.0 kg m(-2) to 3.0 kg m(-2). Traffic, precipitation intensity, and road segment area had the greatest effects on road sediment production. In the first two years after decommissioning the median road sediment production was zero kg m(-2), as the furrows created by ripping trapped nearly all of the eroded sediment. Decommissioning also reduced road-stream connectivity from 12% of the total length to only 2%, with most of the connected segments being immediately adjacent to a stream. While both decommissioning treatments were effective, the ripping plus mulching treatment had visibly less surface erosion and no segment generated any measurable sediment. These results can help guide the design and quantify the benefits of future road decommissioning projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
45,"Ryan, RJ",May 30 2006 ,"Changes in streambed sediment characteristics and solute transport in the headwaters of Valley Creek, an urbanizing watershed",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Changes in streambed sediments were monitored in conjunction with Q series of conservative solute tracer injections over a 2-year period to assess the effects of urbanization on two streams in the Valley Creek watershed, located in Chester County, Pennsylvania approximately 30 km west of Philadelphia. The modeling package OTIS was used to analyze the solute transport behavior. Comparison of the results from the two streams demonstrates that the fine sediment fraction of the streambed controls hydraulic conductivity and transient storage exchange in this gravel- and cobble-bed Piedmont system. One site had a narrow (10-40 m) riparian corridor of mowed lawn and woody brush. At this site, the silt-clay fraction (d < 50 mu m) of the fine sediment (d < 2 mm) increased from 6 to 25% during the course of the study. The relationship between sediment characteristics and transient storage exchange was evaluated using the method of Worman et al. [Worman, A., Packman, A.I., Johansson, H., Jonsson, K., 2002a. Effect of flow-induced exchange in hyporheic zones on longitudinal transport of solutes in streams and rivers. Water Resources Research 38. doi: 10.1029/2001WR000769], who showed that the hyporheic residence time, scaled by the hydraulic conductivity and stream depth, is a function of stream velocity and physical channel characteristics. This analysis indicated that the observed change in fine sediment composition caused a two-fold reduction in the hydraulic conductivity, a four-fold reduction in the transient storage area, and an order of magnitude reduction in the exchange coefficient. The second study site had a wide (100-300 m) riparian corridor of deciduous forest. During the study period, a parcel of woodland encompassing 11% of the drainage area was cleared and nine homes were constructed on the site. Despite this prominent development of the watershed, there was no significant change in sediment characteristics or solute transport during the study period. The model-derived transient storage exchange parameters in our urbanizing study sites were found to be statistically similar to the values for forested mountain streams given in the literature. Thus, the relationship between urbanization and transient storage should be determined by examining the temporal change in the characteristics of individual stream reaches rather than by comparing the solute transport parameters obtained in different types of streams.

46,"Allen, DC",Sep 2020 ,River ecosystem conceptual models and non-perennial rivers: A critical review,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Conceptual models underpin river ecosystem research. However, current models focus on continuously flowing rivers and few explicitly address characteristics such as flow cessation and drying. The applicability of existing conceptual models to nonperennial rivers that cease to flow (intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams, IRES) has not been evaluated. We reviewed 18 models, finding that they collectively describe main drivers of biogeochemical and ecological patterns and processes longitudinally (upstream-downstream), laterally (channel-riparian-floodplain), vertically (surface water-groundwater), and temporally across local and landscape scales. However, perennial rivers are longitudinally continuous while IRES are longitudinally discontinuous. Whereas perennial rivers have bidirectional lateral connections between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, in IRES, this connection is unidirectional for much of the time, from terrestrial-to-aquatic only. Vertical connectivity between surface and subsurface water occurs bidirectionally and is temporally consistent in perennial rivers. However, in IRES, this exchange is temporally variable, and can become unidirectional during drying or rewetting phases. Finally, drying adds another dimension of flow variation to be considered across temporal and spatial scales in IRES, much as flooding is considered as a temporally and spatially dynamic process in perennial rivers. Here, we focus on ways in which existing models could be modified to accommodate drying as a fundamental process that can alter these patterns and processes across spatial and temporal dimensions in streams. This perspective is needed to support river science and management in our era of rapid global change, including increasing duration, frequency, and occurrence of drying.Show less"
47,"Ko, EJ",May 2022 ,Impact of River-Reservoir Hybrid System on Zooplankton Community and River Connectivity,SUSTAINABILITY,"Anthropogenic connectivity regulation in rivers, such as via weirs and dams, affects the plankton community. We hypothesized that the longitudinal similarity of the zooplankton community in a river could change in a river-reservoir hybrid system (RRHS). The impact of weir construction on zooplankton communities in terms of species diversity, abundance, and community structure was examined biweekly at six sites on the Nakdong River for 14 years (before construction: 2002-2008; after construction: 2012-2018). We checked time-series alignment using a dynamic time-warping method between longitudinal survey sites. After RRHS, the zooplankton community showed an increasing number of species. However, RRHS decreased the longitudinal similarity in terms of number of zooplankton species and population density. Our results demonstrate the negative effect of lateral infrastructures on zooplankton populations due to river fragmentation and habitat alteration.Show less"
48,"Pittroff, M",Jan 2017 ,Quantifying nitrate and oxygen reduction rates in the hyporheic zone using Rn-222 to upscale biogeochemical turnover in rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Quantifying and upscaling chemical turnover in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is difficult due to limited reaction rate data, unknown carbon quality, and few methods for upscaling local measurements to river networks. Here we develop a method for quantifying reaction kinetics in situ in the HZ and upscaling biogeochemical turnover to catchment scales. Radon-222 was used to quantify water residence times in the HZ of the Roter Main River (RM), Germany. Residence times were then combined with O-2, NO3-, CO2, DOC, and carbon quality (EEMs, SUVA) data to estimate Monod and first-order reaction rates. Monod parameters mu(max) and k(sat) for NO3- reduction were 11 mu mol l(-1) h(-1) and 52 mmol l(-1), respectively, while the first-order rate was 0.04 h(-1). Carbon quality was highly bioavailable in the HZ and is unlikely to be limiting. Reaction kinetics was incorporated into the FINIFLUX model to upscale NO3- mass loss over a 32 km reach of the RM. The aims were to (1) to estimate hyporheic efficiency using Damkohler numbers (Da), and (2) calculate NO3- mass loss in the HZ over the reach. The Da analysis suggests that the hyporheic zone is inefficient for NO3- processing, however, this is somewhat misleading as the largest NO3- mass loss occurs at the shortest residence times where Da << 1. This is due to the largest water flux occurring in the uppermost part of the sediment profile. Nitrate processing in the HZ accounted for 24 kg NO3- h(-1) over the reach, which was 20% of the NO3- flux from the catchment.Show less"
49,"Duke, JR",Jan 15 2007 ,Riparian influence on hyporheic-zone formation downstream of a small dam in the Blackland Prairie region of Texas,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Small-order streams have highly variable flows that can result in large temporal and spatial variation of the hyporheic zone. Darn construction along these intermittent headwater streams alters downstream flow and influences the hydrologic balance between stream water and the adjacent riparian zone. A 3-year site study was conducted along an impounded second-order stream to determine the water balance between stream, unsaturated zone, groundwater and riparian vegetation. The presence of the upstream impoundment provided near-perennial water flow in the stream channel. The observed woody plant transpiration accounted for 71% of average annual water loss in the site. The overall contribution of stream water via the hyporheic zone to site water balance was 73 cut, or 44% of total inputs. This exceeded both rainfall and upland subsurface contribution to the site. A highly dynamic hyporheic zone was indicated by high water use from woody plants that fluctuated seasonally with stream water levels. We found leaf area development in the canopy layer to be closely coupled with stream and groundwater fluctuations, indicating its usefulness as a potential indicator of site water balance for small dam systems. The net result of upstream impoundment increased riparian vegetation productivity by influencing movement of stream water to storage in the groundwater system.
