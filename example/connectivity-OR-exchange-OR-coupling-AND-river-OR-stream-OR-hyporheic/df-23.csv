1,"Riedel, JW",Sep 2022 ,Investigating Thermal Controls on the Hyporheic Flux as Evaluated Using Numerical Modeling of Flume-Derived Data,HYDROLOGY,"The flux of water through the hyporheic zone (HZ) is controlled by stream bedforms, sinuosity, surface water velocity, local water table, seasonality, and hydraulic conductivity (K) of the bed material. Dependent on both the kinematic viscosity and density of water, K values are a function of temperature. In most studies, changes in temperature have been neglected because of the limited effect either density or viscosity has on K values. However, these variations are important given the role of K in HZ flux, which lead to the hypothesis that flow into the HZ would be more efficient (faster rate and greater depth) under warmer conditions than under cool conditions. To discern how water temperature affects flow depth in the HZ, VS2DHI simulations were created to map flow under both warm and cool thermal conditions. The models employed data collected from a series of varying temperature hydrologic flume tests in which the effects of hyporheic flow altering variables such as sinuosity, surface water velocity and volume, and bed-forms were controlled. Results verify that K values in the HZ were larger under warm conditions generating deeper HZ pathways, while the smaller K values under cool conditions produced shallower pathways. The simulations confirmed a faster speed of frontal movement under warm conditions than cool. Peclet numbers revealed a shallower advective extinction depth under cool conditions as opposed to warm.Show less"
2,"Collins, BM",Jun 2007 ,Subsurface flowpaths in a forested headwater stream harbor a diverse macroinvertebrate community,WETLANDS,"Headwater streams and wetlands with a combination of surface and subsurface flows are common features of many upland-forested watersheds. Unlike headwater stream reaches with continuous surface flow, the hydrology and ecology of subsurface stream reaches are poorly studied and not factored into existing wetland legislation. We assessed subsurface habitats and associated biota in a 435-m reach of a first-order, intermittent stream draining a riparian zone dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in north central Massachusetts. Stream flow was found only in subsurface flowpaths beneath large boulders and surface root mats over approximately 70% of the total stream length at summer base flow. Temperature, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations of subsurface water were similar to surface water. Macroinvertebrates were found in subsurface habitats but at a lower abundance and richness per unit area compared to surface habitats. Collectors such as Chironomidae, Polycentropodidae, and Ephemerellidae were generally the most abundant families in both surface and subsurface habitats. Our findings indicate that in some glaciated watersheds, intermittent streams with no visual evidence of surface flow may contain subsurface flowpaths with water chemistry and biota comparable to coupled perennial surface flow reaches. The prevalence and importance of subsurface habitats in some headwater streams may warrant review or revision of existing state and local regulatory definitions of intermittent and headwater streams.Show less"

In this study, we present a novel Bidirectional Exchange Scheme in Surface and Subsurface (BE3S) that represents bidirectional exchanges between the vadose zone, phreatic aquifer, and river. The approach enables explicit representations of each flow regime while conserving mass, and successfully yields solutions of the coupled system for multiple temporal resolutions. We test the scheme by comparing the BE3S-derived outputs against other models and corresponding observational data. We apply the scheme to simulate hydrologic states in a reach of the Brazos River in Southeast Texas, such as soil moisture content, groundwater level, and river stage as well as net subsurface discharge fluxes. Good agreements between the simulated and observed data for all the components show the suitability of the proposed scheme in modeling the bidirectional flows and exchanges. We also assess how the bidirectional hydrologic exchanges are affected by adjacent flow domains. We find that vertical percolation is significantly affected by unsaturated soil thickness, resulting in the spatial variability of vertical percolation across sloping topography. Hilltop-to-valley convergent groundwater flow is also found to impede vertical percolation in river valleys due to shallow water table while facilitating percolation in the hilltops. The capability of the presented scheme that accounts for the topographically driven lateral groundwater flow and drainage dynamics provides the potential to enhance the representation of the surface-subsurface system in Earth System Models (ESMs).Show less"

Environmental and invertebrate samples were collected monthly from April 2005 to March 2006 at sites with different lateral surface-connection. The investigated invertebrate assemblages were characterized by high biomass and high production. The key factor determining the benthic assemblages was river connectivity and indirectly, substrate characteristics, water transparency, and depth. With increasing river connectivity, biomass and production of oligochaetes, native bivalves, and dipterans decreased, whereas both variables increased for non-native bivalves, gastropods and ephemeropterans. Benthic assemblages of most of sites had an average similarity in the composition of about 50% along the study period, but the number of taxa contributing to the overall similarity was lower at sites located at long distance from the main channel than at sites located next to it. Potential production was high compared to literature data, which underscores the importance of preserving floodplain areas and maintaining natural lateral connectivity. High habitat patchiness mediated by lateral-surface connectivity appeared to promote benthic resources diversity, which in turn controls productivity of this floodplain-river system.Show less"
6,"Bajpai, M",Apr 2022 ,Optimization of Groundwater Pumping and River-Aquifer Exchanges for Management of Water Resources,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"Multi-objective optimization problems can be solved through Simulation-Optimization (S-O) techniques where the pareto front gives the optimal solutions in the problem domains. During the selection of different modelling methods, optimization techniques and management scenarios, several pareto fronts can be generated. In the present work, an attempt has been made by performing intensive comparisons between different pareto fronts to compare the efficiency and convergence of different S-O models. In this process, groundwater models were developed to simulate the River-Aquifer (R-A) exchanges for the study area as groundwater pumping influences the rate of R-A exchanges and alters the flow dynamics. The developed models were coupled with optimization models and were executed to solve the multi-objective optimization problems based on the maximization of discharge through pumping wells and maximization of groundwater input into the river through R-A exchanges. The distinctive features of the paper include a pareto front comparison where fronts developed by different S-O models were compared and analysed based on various parameters. The results show the dominance of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) over other optimization algorithms and concluded that the maximization of pumping rate significantly changes after considering the R-A exchanges-based objective functions. This study concludes that the model domain also alters the output of simulation-optimization. Therefore, model domain and corresponding boundary conditions should be selected carefully for the field application of management models. The artificial neural network (ANN) models have been also developed to deal with the computationally expensive simulation models by reducing the processing time and found efficient.Show less"
7,"Dou, P",Mar 2016 ,Macrobenthos Diversity Response to Hydrological Connectivity Gradient,WETLANDS,"The abundant riparian wetlands supported by the complex river network in Pearl River Delta (PRD) are under an intensely anthropogenic disturbance that threatens the local ecological environment. This paper examined the benthic invertebrate diversity and biomass within the Pearl River through a field study. A fieldwork was conducted to assess a hydrological connectivity gradient among the main channel of the Pearl River. The responses of macroinvertebrate metrics to the connectivity gradient and the restoration history in the river channel were examined. The Shannon diversity index ranged from 0.75 to 2.08, which was the highest among most connectivity river channels. Statistical analyses (PCA and CCA) revealed that the benthic abundance in high hydrological connectivity riverine habitats is clearly distinct from the low connectivity habitats. Results demonstrated that the diversity and density of macrobenthos are determined by hydrological connectivity and time span of the restoration (river channels). Therefore, conservation and restoration efforts should focus on the macroinvertebrate response to the hydrological connectivity of the river channels in PRD.Show less"

The HZ plays an important role in connecting SW and GW in a river ecosystem, thereby helping maintain the ecological health of rivers. Studies on the HZ have therefore increased in many disciplines. This study used the VFLUX 2 software to assess vertical fluid flux in the HZ, in which the Hatch, Kerry, McCallum, and Luce models were applied and compared. The simulations were calibrated against data measured by the US Geological Survey at a water diversion channel within the Walker River Basin in Nevada. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we developed a two-dimensional coupled numerical model of the saturated seepage and temperature fields, calibrated against measured temperature data. We also determined the vertical seepage velocity and compared the simulations with those of the analytical models in VFLUX 2. The results showed that the temperature field distribution of the HZ is obviously nonuniform in space. With a deeper monitoring point, the thermal response of each temperature measurement pointed to periodic temperature fluctuations of the SW, which exhibited attenuation and hysteresis characteristics. When the vertical flow velocity of GW was sufficiently large, an error in the accuracy of the Kerry model amplitude ratio was observed, regardless of the heat dispersion coefficient used. Under conditions of local GW recharge by SW and a heterogeneous permeability coefficient, the use of the amplitude ratio method is recommended to quantify the vertical GW flow rate in the HZ.Show less"
10,"Keesstra, SD",Mar 2019 ,"Coupling hysteresis analysis with sediment and hydrological connectivity in three agricultural catchments in Navarre, Spain",JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"PurposeRain storm events mobilise large proportions of fine sediments in catchment systems. Sediments from agricultural catchments are often adsorbed by nutrients, heavy metals and other (in)organic pollutants that may impact downstream environments. To mitigate erosion, sediment transport and associated pollutant transport, it is crucial to know the origin of the sediment that is found in the drainage system, and therefore, it is important to understand catchment sediment dynamics throughout the continuity of runoff events.Materials and methodsTo assess the impact of the state of a catchment on the transport of fine suspended sediment to catchment outlets, an algorithm has been developed which classifies rain storm events into simple (clockwise, counter-clockwise) and compound (figure-of-eight; complex) events. This algorithm is the first tool that uses all available discharge and suspended sediment data and analyses these data automatically. A total of 797 runoff events from three experimental watersheds in Navarre (Spain) were analysed with the help of long-term, high-resolution discharge and sediment data that was collected between 2000 and 2014.Results and discussionMorphological complexity and in-stream vegetation structures acted as disconnecting landscape features which caused storage of sediment along the transport cascade. The occurrence of sediment storage along transport paths was therefore responsible for clockwise hysteresis due to the availability of in-stream sediment which could cause the first flush affect. Conversely, the catchment with steeper channel gradients and a lower stream density showed much more counter-clockwise hysteresis due to better downstream and lateral surface hydrological connectivity. In this research, hydrological connectivity is defined as the actual and potential transfer paths in a catchment. The classification of event SSC-Q hysteresis provided a seasonal benchmark value to which catchment managers can compare runoff events in order to understand the origin and locations of suspended sediment in the catchment.ConclusionsA new algorithm uses all available discharge and suspended sediment data to assess catchment sediment dynamics. From these analyses, the catchment connectivity can be assessed which is useful to develop catchment land management.Show less"
11,"Marion, A",Oct 14 2008 ,Solute transport in rivers with multiple storage zones: The STIR model,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Solute transport in rivers is controlled by surface hydrodynamics and by mass exchanges between the surface stream and distinct retention zones. This paper presents a residence time model for stream transport of solutes, Solute Transport in Rivers (STIR), that accounts for the effect of the stream-subsurface interactions on river mixing. A stochastic approach is used to derive a relation between the in-stream solute concentration and the residence time distributions (RTDs) in different retention domains. Particular forms of the RTD are suggested for the temporary storage within surface dead zones and for bed form-induced hyporheic exchange. This approach is advantageous for at least two reasons. The first advantage is that exchange parameters can generally be expressed as functions of physical quantities that can be reasonably estimated or directly measured. This gives the model predictive capabilities, and the results can be generalized to conditions different from those directly observed in field experiments. The second reason is that individual exchange processes are represented separately by appropriate residence time distributions, making the model flexible and modular, capable of incorporating the effects of a variety of exchange processes and chemical reactions in a detailed way. The capability of the model is illustrated with an example and with an application to a field case. Analogies and differences with other established models are also discussed.Show less"
12,"Pate, AA",Nov 15 2020 ,Streamflow permanence in headwater streams across four geomorphic provinces in Northern California,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Mountainous headwater streams represent a substantial proportion of the global stream network. These small streams may flow episodically, seasonally, or perennially, providing diverse values and services. Given their broad importance and growing pressures on terrestrial and aquatic resources, we must improve our understanding of the drivers of flow permanence to facilitate informed land and water management decisions. We used field observations from >10 cross-sections in each of 101 non-fish bearing, headwater streams across four geomorphic provinces in Northern California to quantify flow permanence and network connectivity during the summer low flow period in 2018. At each stream cross-section, we noted the presence or absence of streamflow and used this information to classify streams as perennial (continuous streamflow in all cross-sections) or non-perennial and connected (surface water in the most downstream cross-section) or disconnected. At each cross-section, we also quantified channel size (width and depth) and grain size. We coupled field observations with geospatial data of catchment physiography, hydrology, and climate in random forest models to investigate controls of flow permanence and network connectivity. Potential drivers of flow permanence or network connectivity included in our models were channel geometry, grain size, slope, aspect, elevation, annual and seasonal precipitation, air temperature, and topographic wetness index. We found more perennial streams in the Klamath Mountains and Sierra Nevada than in the Cascades and N. Coast regions. Streams in the Klamath were the most connected followed by streams in the N. Coast, Sierra Nevada, and Cascades. The most important variables for predicting flow permanence were channel grain size, winter 2018 precipitation, and drainage area. Comparatively, the most important variables for predicting network connectivity were winter and spring 2018 precipitation, grain size, and bankfull depth. Our study illustrated the complexity of the processes that drive flow permanence and highlighted the uncertainty in projecting the precense of water in streams across diverse regions.Show less"
13,"Hiatt, M",Mar 2018 ,Channel-Island Connectivity Affects Water Exposure Time Distributions in a Coastal River Delta,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exposure time is a water transport time scale defined as the cumulative amount of time a water parcel spends in the domain of interest regardless of the number of excursions from the domain. Transport time scales are often used to characterize the nutrient removal potential of aquatic systems, but exposure time distribution estimates are scarce for deltaic systems. Here we analyze the controls on exposure time distributions using a hydrodynamic model in two domains: the Wax Lake delta in Louisiana, USA, and an idealized channel-island complex. In particular, we study the effects of river discharge, vegetation, network geometry, and tides and use a simple model for the fractional removal of nitrate. In both domains, we find that channel-island hydrological connectivity significantly affects exposure time distributions and nitrate removal. The relative contributions of the island and channel portions of the delta to the overall exposure time distribution are controlled by island vegetation roughness and network geometry. Tides have a limited effect on the system's exposure time distribution but can introduce significant spatial variability in local exposure times. The median exposure time for the WLD model is 10 h under the conditions tested and water transport within the islands contributes to 37-50% of the network-scale exposure time distribution and 52-73% of the modeled nitrate removal, indicating that islands may account for the majority of nitrate removal in river deltas.Show less"
14,"Biron, PM",Sum 2018 ,The need for river management and stream restoration practices to integrate hydrogeomorphology,CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN,"There is growing support amongst scientists worldwide about the need for a shift in river management approaches to include hydrogeomorphic processes. However, the degree to which these concepts are transferred to governmental agencies and practitioners varies widely. In Quebec, for example, many stream restoration projects are based on the (incorrect) assumption that river mobility and its inevitable consequences (bank erosion of meanders, presence of woody debris in the channel) are problematic for salmonids. This paper presents examples drawn from current guidelines on stream restoration for fish habitat in Quebec to demonstrate the need to improve the knowledge exchange among scientists and decision makers about the positive impact of river mobility and large wood dynamics on biodiversity. Our observations reveal that existing guidelines for stream restoration in Quebec need to be revised to better integrate hydrogeomorphic concepts and to no longer assume that maintaining rivers in a static state is beneficial for fish. Adopting the freedom space for rivers approach would likely result in improved habitat as it combines natural processes related to mobility, flooding, and riparian wetland connectivity to determine the minimal space around rivers where development should not be allowed, thus allowing river processes to be restored.La necessite d'integrer l'hydrogeomorphologie pour la gestion des rivieres et les pratiques de restauration des cours d'eau Il existe un consensus croissant parmi les scientifiques du monde entier qu'il est necessaire de changer les approches de gestion des rivieres pour inclure les processus hydrogeomorphologiques. Cependant, la mesure dans laquelle ces concepts sont transferes aux agences et praticiens gouvernementaux varie considerablement. Au Quebec par exemple, plusieurs projets de restauration des cours d'eau sont bases sur l'hypothese (incorrecte) que la mobilite des rivieres et leurs consequences inevitables (erosion de berge des meandres, presence de debris ligneux dans le chenal) sont problematiques pour les salmonides. Cet article presente des exemples tires des lignes directrices actuelles sur la restauration de l'habitat du poisson au Quebec pour demontrer la necessite d'ameliorer le transfert de connaissances entre scientifiques et decideurs sur l'impact positif de la mobilite des rivieres et de la dynamique des bois morts sur la biodiversite. Nos observations revelent que les lignes directrices existantes pour la restauration des cours d'eau au Quebec doivent etre revisees afin de mieux integrer les concepts hydrogeomorphologiques et de ne plus supposer que le maintien des rivieres dans un etat statique soit benefique pour les poissons. Adopter l'approche de gestion par << espace de liberte des cours d'eau >> entrainerait probablement une amelioration de l'habitat, car elle associe des processus naturels lies a la mobilite, aux inondations et a la connectivite des milieux humides riverains pour determiner l'espace minimal autour des rivieres oU le developpement ne devrait pas etre autorise, permettant ainsi de restaurer les processus fluviaux.Show less"
15,"Wade, J",Dec 2020 ,Beaver dam analogues drive heterogeneous groundwater-surface water interactions,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Beaver dam analogues (BDAs) are a cost-effective stream restoration approach that leverages the recognized environmental benefits of natural beaver dams on channel stability and local hydrology. Although natural beaver dams are known to exert considerable influence on the hydrologic conditions of a stream system by mediating geomorphic processes, nutrient cycling, and groundwater-surface water interactions, the impacts of beaver-derived restoration methods on groundwater-surface water exchange are poorly characterized. To address this deficit, we monitored hyporheic exchange fluxes and streambed porewater biogeochemistry across a sequence of BDAs installed along a central Wyoming stream during the summer of 2019. Streambed fluxes were quantified by heat tracing methods and vertical hydraulic gradients. Biogeochemical activity was evaluated using major ion porewater chemistry and principal component analysis. Vertical fluxes of approximately 1.0 m/day were observed around the BDAs, as was the development of spatially heterogeneous zones of nitrate production, groundwater upwelling, and anaerobic reduction. Strong contrasts in hyporheic zone processes were observed across BDAs of differing sizes. This suggests that structures may function with size-dependent behaviour, only altering groundwater-surface water interactions after a threshold hydraulic step height is exceeded. Patterns of hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical cycling around the studied BDAs resemble those around natural beaver dams, suggesting that BDAs may provide comparable benefits to channel complexity and near-stream function over a 1-year period.Show less"
16,"Lasne, E",Dec 2008 ,European eel distribution and body condition in a river floodplain: effect of longitudinal and lateral connectivity,ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,"We studied eel population characteristics (size classes, densities and body condition) in the lower Loire River floodplain (France) to evaluate the effects of longitudinal and lateral gradients. A total of 36 sites were electrofished in June 2005. The sites were grouped first into three river segments according to the distance inland corresponding to a longitudinal gradient and secondly into three lateral connectivity categories. Results indicate that small eels, especially those <= 300 mm, were very abundant downstream but density rapidly decreased upstream. In addition, eels <= 150 mm tended to be most abundant in connected waterbodies. Conversely, the distribution of larger eels was quite uniform across both dimensions. Eel condition decreased upstream. In parallel, in downstream river segment, eels had a lower condition in disconnected waterbodies than in connected ones. Eel specialists still have only a longitudinal perception of eel habitat. Our results suggest that lateral gradients should be also taken into consideration.Show less"
17,"Laenen, A",Apr 2001 ,"Transient storage assessments of dye-tracer injections in rivers of the Willamette Basin, Oregon",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Rhodamine WT dye-tracer injections in rivers of the Willamette Basin yield concentration-time curves with characteristically long recession times suggestive of active transient storage processes. The scale of drainage areas contributing to the stream reaches studied in the Willamette Basin ranges from 10 to 12,000 km(2). A transient storage assessment of the tracer studies has been completed using the U.S. Geological Survey's One-dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage (OTIS) model, which incorporates storage exchange and decay functions along with the traditional dispersion and advection transport equation. The analysis estimates solute transport of the dye. It identifies first-order decay coefficients to be on the order of 10(-5)/sed for the nonconservative Rhodamine WT. On an individual subreach basis, the first-order decay is slower (typically by an order of magnitude) than the transient storage process, indicating that nonconservative tracers may be used to evaluate transient storage in rivers. In the transient storage analysis, a dimensionless parameter (A(S)/A) expresses the spatial extent of storage zone area relative to stream cross section. In certain reaches of Willamette Basin pool-and-riffle, gravel-bed rivers, this parameter was as large as 0.5. A measure of the storage exchange flux was calculated for each stream subreach in the simulation analysis. This storage exchange is shown subjectively to be higher at higher stream discharges. Hyporheic linkage between streams and subsurface flows is the probable physical mechanism contributing to a significant part of this inferred active transient storage. Hyporheic linkages are further suggested by detailed measurements of river discharge with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler system delineating zones in two large rivers where water alternately enters and leaves the surface channels through gravel-and-cobble riverbeds. Measurements show patterns of hyporheic exchange that are highly variable in time and space.Show less"
18,"Roche, KR",May 2018 ,Turbulence Links Momentum and Solute Exchange in Coarse-Grained Streambeds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of solutes between surface and pore waters is an important control over stream ecology and biogeochemistry. Free-stream turbulence is known to enhance transport across the sediment-water interface (SWI), but the link between turbulent momentum and solute transport within the hyporheic zone remains undetermined due to a lack of in situ observations. Here, we relate turbulent momentum and solute transport using measurements within a streambed with 0.04 m diameter sediment. Pore water velocities were measured using endoscopic particle image velocimetry and used to generate depth profiles of turbulence statistics. Solute transport was observed directly within the hyporheic zone using an array of microsensors. Solute injection experiments were used to assess turbulent fluxes across the SWI and patterns of hyporheic mixing. Depth profiles of fluctuations in solute concentration were compared with profiles of turbulence statistics, and profiles of mean solute concentration were compared to an effective dispersion model. Fluorescent visualization experiments at a Reynolds number of Re >= 27,000 revealed the presence of large-scale motions that ejected tracer from the pore waters, and that these events were not present at Re = 13,000. Turbulent shear stresses and high-frequency concentration fluctuations decayed greatly within 1-2 grain diameters below the SWI. However, low-frequency concentration fluctuations penetrated to greater depths than high-frequency fluctuations. Comparison with a constant-coefficient dispersion model showed that hyporheic mixing was enhanced in regions where turbulent stresses were observed. Together, these results show that the penetration of turbulence into the bed directly controls both interfacial exchange and mixing within a transition layer below the SWI.Plain Language Summary Streams and rivers continuously exchange water with their underlying sediments in a region called the hyporheic zone. This zone is a hotspot of transformation for many societally relevant chemicals, including carbon, nutrients, and contaminants. Accurate predictions for how much transformation occurs in the hyporheic zone requires an improved understanding of how reactive chemicals are transported into, and within, this region of a riverbed. Although fluid turbulence can be the dominant process controlling surface-subsurface exchange in gravel-bed streams, its influence is poorly understood due to the difficulty of measuring turbulent fluid velocities and concentrations within the streambed. In this experimental study, we show that turbulence strongly couples surface waters with hyporheic waters in a thin layer where the water column and stream sediments meet. As a result, fluid transport and mixing are enhanced several centimeters into the hyporheic zone of gravel-bed streams. These findings support recent theoretical arguments that surface and subsurface waters are not independent and must instead be treated as a single unit to accurately model solute, particulate and pollutant transport in streams and rivers.Show less"
19,"Kim, H",Apr 16 2014 ,Numerical verification of hyporheic zone depth estimation using streambed temperature,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hyporheic zone is the active region of groundwater and surface water mixing, and consequently, through which the contaminants released to surface water are transferred to groundwater. Because of the high energy demand and expense associated with the remediation of contaminated groundwater, it has become a matter of primary concern to find an efficient and cost-effective way to restore the contaminated groundwater. Therefore delineating the hyporheic zone is of vital importance for the prevention and management of groundwater contamination. This paper proposes a method to estimate the depth of the hyporheic zone using heat transfer analysis for a streambed. In order to assess the adequacy of the proposed method, the sensitivity of the results of heat transfer analyses to the hyporheic flux was evaluated. Due to the high sensitivity to the hyporheic zone depth, the heat transfer analysis was determined to be appropriate to delineate the hyporheic zone depth. The depth estimated from the heat transfer analysis was comparable with that from a conventional tracer test. The proposed method has an advantage over existing methods of determining the hyporheic zone depth due to the fact that it only requires field temperature measurements.

20,"Lefebvre, S",Oct 2005 ,Nutrient dynamics in interstitial habitats of low-order rural streams with different bedrock geology,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"We Studied water exchange, nutrient dynamics, and microbial activities between the Surface and interstitial habitats of six low-order streams with catchments dominated by agriculture during high and low water periods. In each stream, surface (open) water and interstitial water form downwelling and Upwelling zones were considered. Interstitial habitats of most streams acted as a sink for nitrate, but as a source for ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). The nitrate sink persisted in shallow sediments of downwelling zones, while the source of ammonium and SRP persisted in deeper sediments of upwelling zones, where organic matter was decomposed and microbial uptake was lower than the production of nutrients. Geology (granite versus schist substratum) was the main variable controlling the nutrient contents and the microbial activity within interstitial habitats due to varying sediment grain size and hydraulic properties. Schist streams had the finest sediment grain size and lowest hydrologic connectivity between Surface water and interstitial habitats, and had the highest potential microbial activities, especially for denitrification. Land-use of the catchments (percentage of forested area), channel morphology (river incision), and local characteristics of the benthic sediment (partial clogging) also influenced nutrient concentrations and microbial activities irrespectively of the geology of the catchment.Show less"
21,"Gulley, J",Nov 2013 ,"Dissolution in a variably confined carbonate platform: effects of allogenic runoff, hydraulic damming of groundwater inputs, and surface-groundwater exchange at the basin scale",EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"In variably confined carbonate platforms, impermeable confining units collect rainfall over large areas and deliver runoff to rivers or conduits in unconfined portions of platforms. Runoff can increase river stage or conduit heads in unconfined portions of platforms faster than local infiltration of rainfall can increase groundwater heads, causing hydraulic gradients between rivers, conduits and the aquifer to reverse. Gradient reversals cause flood waters to flow from rivers and conduits into the aquifer where they can dissolve limestone. Previous work on impacts of gradient reversals on dissolution has primarily emphasized individual caves and little research has been conducted at basin scales. To address this gap in knowledge, we used legacy data to assess how a gradient of aquifer confinement across the Suwannee River Basin, north-central Florida affected locations, magnitudes and processes of dissolution during 2005-2007, a period with extreme ranges of discharge. During intense rain events, runoff from the confining unit increased river stage above groundwater heads in unconfined portions of the platform, hydraulically damming inputs of groundwater along a 200 km reach of river. Hydraulic damming allowed allogenic runoff with SICAL<-4 to fill the entire river channel and flow into the aquifer via reversing springs. Storage of runoff in the aquifer decreased peak river discharges downstream and contributed to dissolution within the aquifer. Temporary storage of allogenic runoff in karst aquifers represents hyporheic exchange at a scale that is larger than found in streams flowing over non-karst aquifers because conduits in karst aquifers extend the area available for exchange beyond river beds deep into aquifers. Post-depositional porosity in variably confined carbonate platforms should thus be enhanced along rivers that originate on confining units. This distribution should be considered in models of porosity distribution used to manage water and hydrocarbon resources in carbonate rocks. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"

Current microfluidic bead-based immunoassay mainly relies on magnetic and centrifugal forces to manipulate microparticles to complete an assay protocol. Here we report an acoustic streaming-based microfluidic method that can perform all the fluid and particle operations of bead-based ELISA. A series of sharp-edge structures are used to generate a long-range coupled acoustic streaming that enables simultaneous particle trapping and active molecular exchange in a dead-end microchannel. The device achieved > 99% of molecular exchange in 4 min, while maintaining a particle trapping efficiency of 85%. This acoustofluidic-based method demonstrates all three key operations in a bead-based immunoassay: (1) Beads ""immobilization""; (2) Active mixing of fluid for bead/target binding; (3) Active molecular exchange for reagent loading and washing. Finally, on-chip quantitative detection of biomarker IL-6 with a limit of detection similar to 50 pg/mL is achieved using this platform including an enzymatic signal amplification step. The small footprint, simple setup, and continuous flow operation of the acoustic streaming-based method makes it an attractive platform for continuous flow bead-based immunoassay.

23,"Zhao, YH",Oct 2021 ,Coordination Study on Ecological and Economic Coupling of the Yellow River Basin,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"The coupling and coordination relationship between ecology and the economy in the Yellow River Basin is a hot topic in sustainable development research. Said research has important guiding significance for the ecological security and comprehensive development of the Yellow River Basin. Taking the Yellow River Basin as the object of our study, based on the data of the economy, energy consumption data, ecology data and water resources data, we construct an indicator system of the economic development and ecological status of the Yellow River Basin and use the principal component analysis method to calculate the economic development and ecological status index. Then, we use the evaluation method, the coupling degree model and the coupling coordination degree model to analyze the time and space evolution trends of economic development and ecological state, coupling degree and coupling coordination degree. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2018, the economic development index of the Yellow River Basin rose steadily; the ecological status index showed a slow rise and then a downward trend. (2) The degree of coupling between economic development and ecological state has been considered as intensity coupling after 2005. The coupling trend slowly increased and then decreased, indicating that the interaction effect between the economy and ecology was first significantly enhanced and then slowly weakened. (3) The degree of coupling coordination increased from 0.2994 to 0.6266 and then decreased to 0.5917, reflecting the continuous improvement of the relationship between the regional economy and the ecological environment and the trend toward coordination. From 2015 to 2018, due to the gradual increase in the difference between economic development and ecological conditions, the coupling and coordination between the two decreased. Studies have shown that ecological construction and protection should be strengthened to ease the contradiction between the economy and ecology and achieve coordinated development.Show less"

Alburnus vistonicus, a potamodromous species inhabiting the Vistonis freshwater system in northern Greece, manages to cope with wide salinity fluctuations in Vistonis Lake, but the impact of the fragmented connectivity of the lake's two main freshwater suppliers, Kosynthos and Kompsatos rivers, has not been assessed. We analyzed the species whole reproductive cycle and we divided it into phases. Cyclicity was observed in gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter, while total fecundity remained constant prior to the onset of the spawning season. Stomach fullness and condition factor differed among the surveyed habitats. Successful spawning and multiple spawning were verified, as well as spawning migration and potamodromy. However, mature females with markers of recent spawning activity were captured also in the lake, suggesting spawning occurrence in the lake or a previously undocumented oscillatory behavior between the lake and the rivers during the spawning season and between sequential spawning events. Either behavior may serve as a mechanism to overcome the restricted spawning migration routes due to the fragmented river connectivity.Show less"
26,"Battin, TJ",Oct 1999 ,Hydrologic flow paths control dissolved organic carbon fluxes and metabolism in an alpine stream hyporheic zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The objective of the present paper was to link reach-scale streambed reactive uptake of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) to subsurface flow paths in an alpine stream (Oberer Seebach (OSB)). The topography adjacent to the stream channel largely determined flow paths, with shallow hillslope groundwater flowing beneath the stream and entering the alluvial groundwater at the opposite bank. As computed from hydrometric data, OSB consistently lost stream water to groundwater with fluxes out of the stream averaging 943 +/- 47 and 664 +/- 45 L m(-2) h(-1) at low (Q < 600 L s(-1)) and high (Q > 600 L s(-1)) flow, respectively. Hydrometric segregation of streambed fluxes and physicochemical mixing analysis indicated that stream water was the major input component to the streambed with average contributions of 70-80% to the hyporheic zone (i.e., the subsurface zone where shallow groundwater and stream water mix). Surface water was also the major source of DOC with 0.512 +/- 0.043 mg C m(-2) h(-1) to the streambed. The DOC flux from shallow riparian groundwater was lower (0.309 +/- 0.071 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and peaked in autumn with 1.011 mg C m(-2) h(-1). I computed the relative proportion of downstream discharge through the streambed as the ratio of the downstream length (S-sw) a stream water parcel travels before entering the streambed to the downstream length (S-hyp) a streambed water parcel travels before returning to the stream water. The relative streambed DOC retention efficiency, calculated as (input-output)/input of interstitial DOG, correlated with the proportion (S-sw/S-hyp) of downstream discharge (r(2) = 0.76, p = 0.006), Also, did the streambed metabolism (calculated as DO uptake from mass balance) decrease with low subsurface downstream routing, whereas elevated downstream discharge through the streambed stimulated DO uptake (r(2) = 0.69, p = 0.019)? Despite the very short DOC turnover times (similar to 0.05 days, calculated as mean standing stock/annual input) within the streambed, the latter constitutes a net sink of DOC (similar to 14 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). Along with high standing stocks of sediment associated particulate organic carbon, these results suggest microbial biofilms as the major retention and storage site of DOC in an alpine stream where large hydrologic exchange controls DOC fluxes.Show less"
27,"Emanuel, RE",Apr 2014 ,Vegetation and topographic influences on the connectivity of shallow groundwater between hillslopes and streams,ECOHYDROLOGY,"Little is known about the combined effects of vegetation and topography on hillslope water table dynamics. In forested headwater catchments, complex terrain and vegetation intersect to impose large spatial and temporal variability in the vertical and lateral redistribution of water from hillslopes to streams. Here, we demonstrate, using empirical data from the Northern Rocky Mountains, that vegetation interacts with landscape topography to influence hillslope-riparian-stream hydrologic connectivity. We compared a measured relationship between hillslope contributing area and hydrologic connectivity during the growing season to LiDAR-derived vegetation characteristics and found that two behavioural regimes emerged. Among some hillslopes, hydrologic connectivity decreased as vegetation density increased, demonstrating that growing season hydrologic connectivity is subject to the balance between evapotranspiration and lateral redistribution of soil water. Among other hillslopes, hydrologic connectivity increased as vegetation density increased. For the latter set of hillslopes, hydrologic connectivity cannot be explained by topography and vegetation alone. When we compared joint distributions of vegetation density and modelled solar irradiance between the two regimes as another indicator of evapotranspiration, we found that conditions were generally more favourable for higher transpiration on hillslopes where hydrologic connectivity decreased as vegetation density increased than on hillslopes where the opposite behaviour was observed. Our results demonstrate not only the importance of vegetation heterogeneity for hillslope-riparian-stream connectivity but also the importance of other spatially distributed variables such as energy availability when considering the influence of topography on hydrological processes.

28,"Butturini, A",Jun 2002 ,The influence of riparian-hyporheic zone on the hydrological responses in an intermittent stream,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Stream and riparian groundwater hydrology has been studied in a small intermittent stream draining a forested catchment for a system representative of a Mediterranean climate, The relationship between precipitation and stream runoff and the interactions between stream water and the surrounding riparian groundwater have been analysed under a wide spectrum of meteorological conditions. The hypothesis that the hydrological condition of the near-stream groundwater compartment can regulate the runoff generation during precipitation events was tested, Stream runoff is characterised by a summer dry period, and precipitation input explained only 250,6 of runoff variability over the study period (r(2)=0.25, d.f,=5 1, p<0,001). The variability of precipitation v. stream runoff is explained partly by the hydrogeological properties of the riparian near-stream zone. This zone is characterised by high hydrological conductivity values and abrupt changes in groundwater level in summer. The summer dry period begins with a rapid decrease in near-stream groundwater level, and ends just after the first autumnal rain when the original groundwater level recovers suddenly. Within this period, storms do not cause major stream runoff since water infiltrates rapidly into the riparian compartment until it is refilled during the subsequent winter and spring; then the precipitation explains the 80% of the stream runoff variability (r(2)=0. 80, d.f.=34, p<0.001), These results suggest that the hydrological interaction between the riparian groundwater compartment and the stream channel is important in elucidating the hydrological responses during drought periods in small Mediterranean streams.Show less"
29,"Jiang, YX",Mar 1 2021 ,"The impact assessment of hydro-biological connectivity changes on the estuary wetland through the ecological restoration project in the Yellow River Delta, China",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Yellow River Delta (YRD) is one of the youngest delta with complex hydrological and biological connectivity in the world, where offers habitats to the famous waterfowls in the Eastern Asia. Meanwhile, one specific ecological restoration project named as the ""Wuwanmu"" and followed by the ""Shiwanmu"" within the National Nature Reserve of the Yellow River Delta (NNRYRD) complicated the hydrological and biological connectivity. How to quantitatively evaluate the extent of coastal wetland affected by the project will be a difficult problem. Hence the authors presented three innovative models of the Marine Connectivity Change Index (MCCI), the Coupling Index of Hydro-biological Connectivity (CIHBC), and the Assessment Index of Suitability on Bird Habitats (AISBH). After the project, the habitat of Phragmites australis has been restored effectively with the increased area of 24.59%, while the habitat of Suaeda salsa as the native species lost largely with decreased area of 84.62%. And the tidal channel having been cut off by the project resulted in isolating the buildup restoration area from seawater, and reshaping completely the plant habitat environment. So the hydrological and biological connectivity has been changed largely with the 47.79% decreased MCCI area and the 16.3% decreased zero-valued CIHBC area. However the AISBH non-zero-valued area increased 10.7%, and with the hidden worry of the decreased Grallatores number. From the connectivity prospective, three models presented a significant methodology to evaluate the complex impact on the estuary wetland habitat caused by the restoration project. In the long run, the ecological impacts should be highlighted to the change of tidal channel and the corresponding tidal issues, and the continuous and big loss of native plant spices such as S. salsa. The further study needs to explore the longer-term assessment of the ecological restoration project and its multiple effect in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
30,"Pracheil, BM",Jan 2019 ,Lifelong population connectivity between large rivers and their tributaries: A case study of shovelnose sturgeon from the Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers,ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,"Fishes that depend on large-river habitats have declined in many regions due to human alteration of both mainstems and tributaries. Conserving these species is often complicated by their dependence on long-distance movements to complete their life cycle, but the location of key habitats is difficult to assess across multiple life history stages. Movement of large-river fishes between mainstems and major tributaries is commonly observed, but the role of these exchanges at the population level is uncertain. We used shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus platorynchus) as a case study for assessing the lifelong spatial ecology of large-river fishes. Fin ray microchemistry data indicate that shovelnose sturgeon from the Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers represent a unified population that relies on connections among multiple large-river habitats throughout life history. The tributary serves as an important spawning area, but fin ray chemistry data suggest larvae subsequently drift downstream to nursery habitats in the mainstem; an assertion that is supported by extensive field survey data. Our analyses underscore the lifelong importance of connections within river networks for maintaining viable populations of this, and likely other large-river species that have been documented to use tributary habitats. These findings support a metapopulation perspective on species that depend on large-river habitats, many of which are now highly altered and fragmented. For shovelnose sturgeon and species with similar life history, protecting or restoring linkages between mainstem rivers and their tributaries should be a conservation priority.Show less"
31,"Gomez-Gener, L",Sep 2021 ,Towards an improved understanding of biogeochemical processes across surface-groundwater interactions in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,"Surface-groundwater interactions in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES), waterways which do not flow year-round, are spatially and temporally dynamic because of alternations between flowing, non-flowing and dry hydrological states. Interactions between surface and groundwater often create mixing zones with distinct redox gradients, potentially driving high rates of carbon and nutrient cycling. Yet a complete understanding of how underlying biogeochemical processes across surface-groundwater flowpaths in IRES differ among various hydrological states remains elusive. Here, we present a conceptual framework relating spatial and temporal hydrological variability in surface water-groundwater interactions to biogeochemical processing hotspots in IRES. We combine a review of theIRES biogeochemistry literature with concepts of IRES hydrogeomorphology to: (i) outline common distinctions among hydrological states in IRES; (ii) use these distinctions, together with considerations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles within IRES, to predict the relative potential for biogeochemical processing across different reach-scale processing zones (flowing water, fragmented pools, hyporheic zones, groundwater, and emerged sediments); and (iii) explore the potential spatial and temporal variability of carbon and nutrient biogeochemical processing across entire IRES networks. Our approach esti- mates the greatest reach-scale potential for biogeochemical processing when IRES reaches are fragmented into isolated surface water pools, and highlights the potential of relatively understudied processing zones, such as emerged sediments. Furthermore, biogeochemical processing in fluvial networks dominated by IRES is likely more temporally than spatially variable. We conclude that biogeochemical research in IRES would benefit from focusing on interactions between different nutrient cycles, surface-groundwater interactions in non-flowing states, and consideration of fluvial network architecture. Our conceptual framework outlines opportunities to advance studies and expand understanding of biogeochemistry in IRES.Show less"
32,"Lopera-Congote, L",Oct 2021 ,River connectivity and climate behind the long-term evolution of tropical American floodplain lakes,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"This study presents the long-term evolution of two floodplains lakes (San Juana and Barbacoas) of the Magdalena River in Colombia with varying degree of connectivity to the River and with different responses to climate events (i.e., extreme floods and droughts). Historical limnological changes were identified through a multiproxy-based reconstruction including diatoms, sedimentation, and sediment geochemistry, while historical climatic changes were derived from the application of the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index. The main gradients in climatic and limnological change were assessed via multivariate analysis and generalized additive models. The reconstruction of the more isolated San Juana Lake spanned the last c. 500 years. Between c. 1,620 and 1,750 CE, riverine-flooded conditions prevailed as indicated by high detrital input, reductive conditions, and dominance of planktonic diatoms. Since the early 1800s, the riverine meander became disconnected, conveying into a marsh-like environment rich in aerophil diatoms and organic matter. The current lake was then formed around the mid-1960s with a diverse lake diatom flora including benthic and planktonic diatoms, and more oxygenated waters under a gradual increase in sedimentation and nutrients. The reconstruction for Barbacoas Lake, a waterbody directly connected to the Magdalena River, spanned the last 60 years and showed alternating riverine-wetland-lake conditions in response to varying ENSO conditions. Wet periods were dominated by planktonic and benthic diatoms, while aerophil diatom species prevailed during dry periods; during the two intense ENSO periods of 1987 and 1992, the lake almost desiccated and sedimentation rates spiked. A gradual increase in sedimentation rates post-2000 suggests that other factors rather than climate are also influencing sediment deposition in the lake. We propose that hydrological connectivity to the Magdalena River is a main factor controlling lake long-term responses to human pressures, where highly connected lakes respond more acutely to ENSO events while isolated lakes are more sensitive to local land-use changes.Show less"

34,"Merritt, DM",Jan 2006 ,Plant dispersal along rivers fragmented by dams,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"To understand the influence of dams on connectivity of riparian plant communities along rivers, we examined plant dispersal by water (hydrochory) and riparian plant community attributes upstream and downstream from dams on two rivers in the southern Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA. Drifting plant propagules were collected from the water column along reaches upstream and downstream from dams to examine the longitudinal and temporal variation in seed-pool species composition and concentration of water-transported seeds. Similarities between species composition of the hydrochoric seed pool and local standing riparian vegetation were used to evaluate the degree of longitudinal connectivity along river corridors and to isolate the relative contributions of local versus regional species pools to hydrochoric species composition. Furthermore, several synthetic attributes (longevity, origin, life-form and dispersal mode) and species composition of riparian plant communities were examined to explore the effects of interrupted propagule dispersal on standing vegetation.We estimated that as many as 120 million seeds were transported via hydrochory along free-flowing reaches of the Rocky Mountain streams in a single growing season. Seed concentration (seeds/m(3)) in the water column was reduced by 70-94% along reaches downstream from dams compared to free-flowing reaches. The similarity in species composition of hydrochoric seeds and local standing vegetation was nearly two times greater downstream from reservoirs compared to upstream. This suggests that hydrochory complements local species pools by importing seeds from throughout the upstream catchment area along freeflowing river reaches, but that hydrochoric seeds are derived primarily from local sources along regulated river reaches. Species richness recovers as a function of downstream distance from contributions of standing vegetation and seeds from tributary streams. Hydrochory may extend the period over which viable seeds of a parent population are dispersed. Even after dispersal of parent populations has terminated, seeds may continue to be available due to residence time in water transport. This extension of the 'effective dispersal window' of some species may exceed two weeks or more and may influence the likelihood of successful establishment.In this study, synthetic attributes of riparian vegetation did not differ significantly between free-flowing and regulated reaches, whereas formal statistical comparisons of community composition upstream and downstream from reservoirs indicate that there are differences in community composition upstream and downstream from dams. These findings suggest that the consequences of 50 to 100 years of fragmentation result in community-wide effects along Rocky Mountain streams and that these effects may be partially explained by dam-caused disruption in connectivity of plant populations.

35,"Simon, TN",Feb 2011 ,The contribution of man-made ditches to the regional stream biodiversity of the new river watershed in the Florida panhandle,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The role of ditches as reservoirs for or contributors to regional diversity has rarely been assessed. In this study, we aimed (1) to assess the effect of ditches on aquatic faunal assemblages of first order streams and (2) to assess the extent to which the animal communities in altered streams that are crossed by ditches resembled those found in nearby natural streams. We examined the fauna of four different aquatic habitats of the New River watershed in the Florida Panhandle: (1) natural streams, (2) altered streams, (3) ditches that cross the altered streams, and (4) ditches that do not cross the altered streams, sampling these habitats in three geographically distinct sites and visiting each location three times during a summer. Ditches did not have the same environmental features as streams and as a result their faunal community did not completely mimic those of natural streams. Streams contained 50% less aquatic vegetation and more canopy cover, while natural streams were more acidic than any other habitat. The connected altered stream and ditch habitats contained the highest biodiversity, while natural streams contained the lowest. Our ordination of taxonomic composition did not reveal any significant differences between habitats. However, natural streams were more likely to contain Hyalella spp., Oligochaetes, and Palaemonetes spp. than other sites, yet did not contain Baetidae spp., Naucorida spp., Trepobate spp., Dolomedes okefinokensis, Leptolucania ommata, or any Centrarcids. These results indicate the importance of ditches within this system as a reservoir for and contributor to regional stream biodiversity and this finding should be taken into consideration by managers for the conservation of the regional freshwater biodiversity.Show less"

The aim was to elucidate the significance of DOM in relation to hydrological conditions. Two floodplain segments with varying degree of connection to the main channel (and for some parameters also the main channel) of the Danube River downstream of Vienna (Austria) were investigated during two hydrologically dynamic periods. In most cases, inorganic nutrients were significantly Coupled to hydrology, but bulk dissolved organic nutrient species in two DOM size fractions were poorly correlated with changing connectivity with the main river. A more specific investigation of DOM properties (fluorescence index based on fulvic acids, carbohydrate content of dissolved organic carbon) revealed good correlation with hydrology, thus mirroring more directly the effect of changing floodplain connectivity and emphasising the importance of local (autochthonous) carbon sources at lower connectivity. BSP, measured during one of the investigated periods, was highly variable, with low values at high discharge and a significant positive dependency on increasing autochthonous DOM-sources indicated by higher fluorescence indices. Hydrological connectivity between the main river and its floodplains appears to be a crucial driving force influencing the quantity but in particular the quality of DOM as well as related microbial processes.Show less"
37,"Torrens, CL",Jul 2022 ,Dissolved Organic Carbon Chemostasis in Antarctic Polar Desert Streams,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key variable impacting stream biogeochemical processes. The relationship between DOC concentration (C) and stream discharge (q) can elucidate spatial and temporal DOC source dynamics in watersheds. In the ephemeral glacial meltwater streams of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica, the C-q relationship has been applied to dissolved inorganic nitrogen and weathering solutes including silica, which all exhibit chemostatic C-q behavior; but DOC-q dynamics have not been studied. DOC concentrations here are low compared to temperate streams, in the range of 0.1-2 mg C l(-1), and their chemical signal clearly indicates derivation from microbial biomass (benthic mats and hyporheic biofilm). To investigate whether the DOC generation rate from these autochthonous organic matter pools was sufficient to maintain chemostasis for DOC, despite these streams' large diel and interannual fluctuations in discharge, we fit the long-term DOC-q data to a power law and an advection-reaction model. Model outputs and coefficients of variation characterize the DOC-q relationship as chemostatic for several MDV streams. We propose a conceptual model in which hyporheic carbon storage, hyporheic exchange rates, and net DOC generation rates are key interacting components that enable chemostatic DOC-q behavior in MDV streams. This model clarifies the role of autochthonous carbon stores in maintaining DOC chemostasis and may be useful for examining these relationships in temperate systems, which typically have larger sources of bioavailable autochthonous organic carbon than MDV streams but where this autochthonous signal could be masked by a stronger allochthonous contribution.Show less"
38,"Liao, F",May 2021 ,Tracing Bank Storage and Hyporheic Exchange Dynamics Using Rn-222: Virtual and Field Tests and Comparison With Other Tracers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Dynamic hydrologic exchange flows in river beds and banks are important for many ecosystem functions throughout river corridors. Here we test whether the exchanges and the associated mixing between a flooding river and groundwater within the river's bank can be effectively traced by Radon-222 (Rn-222), a naturally occurring, inert, radiogenic, and radioactive gas that can be analyzed and monitored in situ. The assessment was done by simulation of groundwater flow and reactive transport of Rn-222 in the bank following a single, relatively rapid (hours long) flood wave and auxiliary field observations of Rn-222, temperature and total dissolved solids (a surrogate for any ionic conservative tracer). Results illustrate that Rn-222 is more effective than temperature and total dissolved solids in tracing dynamic hyporheic exchange. Rn-222 variations in space and time are larger than the analytical uncertainty of common measurement methods. The individual effects of aquifer hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity, river water Rn-222 concentration, and bank topography were analyzed through sensitivity analysis. Larger hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity, lower Rn-222 concentration in river water relative to groundwater, and gentler bank slopes resulted in a more prominent and traceable Rn-222 signal. The transport and residence time of exchanged water may be estimated and interpreted using reactive transport models such as those implemented here. However, such application is sensitive to fluctuations in river water Rn-222, requiring it to be well characterized. The assessment provides guidance for using Rn-222 as a tracer for groundwater and surface water interactions in dynamic settings.Show less"
39,"Ali, GA",Oct 15 2010 ,Source-to-stream connectivity assessment through end-member mixing analysis,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Streamflow sources across various hydrologic conditions were examined in a 5.1 ha temperate humid forested catchment (Laurentians, Canada). In that system, the relationship between rainfall and runoff is nonlinear, thus hinting towards complex processes involving critical, transient source areas and a changing catchment internal state of connectivity. Multiyear daily stream chemistry data were broken down into several hydrologic scenarios reflecting different conditions with respect to stream discharge and antecedent catchment wetness. End-member mixing analysis and mass balance calculations were performed to: (I) compare the dimensionality of the mixing spaces (i.e. the number of streamflow sources) obtained under 64 different hydrologic scenarios; (2) screen independently sampled end-members (i.e. the nature of sources) to assess catchment connectivity from a spatial perspective; and (3) estimate the relative contributions of end-members to streamflow to characterize hydrological connectivity from a volumetric standpoint. Mixing space dimensionality did not vary significantly among the tested hydrologic scenarios, as three end-members were generally required to account for most of the variance in stream geochemistry. Differences were significant in the ability of the tested end-members to fit in mixing spaces; for instance, throughfall and organic soil water end-members better fitted in mixing spaces associated with high rather than low discharges. The relative contributions of end-members to streamflow were highly variable in time. Scenarios involving low discharges and dry antecedent conditions were mostly associated with baseflow, while scenarios involving high discharges and wet antecedent conditions were associated with increased proportions of throughfall and organic soil water from downstream downslope and downstream upslope areas. These results suggest a cautious evaluation of the predictive power of one single mixing space with regards to the nature of streamflow sources across hydrologic conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Scale-freeness of networks for phenomena in many disciplines have been studied with mixed results. Here we present the first documented example of a (roughly) scale-free network of surface-water connections within a river-floodplain landscape. We accomplish this by simulating 23 inundation maps across the historical range of flows for the Mission River in Texas. We then analyze the topology of the surface-water connections between the river and two habitat patch types. Results show that surface-water connectivity is scale-free for >= 64% of simulated flows (>= 70% for flows with floodplain inundation). Moreover, the dynamic surface-water connections meet five of the six conceptual criteria of scale-free networks. Our findings indicate that river-floodplain landscapes are self-organizing toward scale-free surface-water connections among patches that optimizes energy and matter exchange.Show less"

Understanding the mech-anism of sediment transport change and its effects is of great importance to food and environmental security. Numerical approaches are useful to map and assess spatio-temporal patterns in sediment dynamics. This study evaluates monthly and annual sediment connectivity in the Wei River Basin (134,800 km2) at the basin and sub -basin scales using the aggregated index of sediment connectivity (AIC). For the first time, this index is applied on this relatively large regional scale. The two objectives were to (1) evaluate the performance of the AIC at the regional scale, addressing substantial differences among areas, and (2) analyze how each AIC sub-factor co-determines the monthly sediment and connectivity patterns. Results show that AIC has strong or moderate positive correlation with sediment yield from 15 out of 23 stations in the Wei and Jing sub-basin. The Jing sub -basin has the highest sediment connectivity due to degraded vegetation, while the Beiluo sub-basin has the lowest sediment connectivity on average due to better ecological restoration. Within the year, sediment con-nectivity is highest in April and lowest in January, due to the rainfall regime and intra-annual land cover var-iations. Among the AIC factors, the rainfall factor has the highest effect on sediment connectivity, implying that functional connectivity (graded by rainfall and soil cover) determines sediment dynamics more than structural connectivity (mainly determined by topography and soil permeability). This study provides one of the first large-scale estimates of spatial and temporal sediment connectivity from hillslopes to river stream and including large reservoirs, which can be further employed to implement regional ecological construction works and environ-mental catchment management.Show less"

Little is known, however, about corresponding changes in functional connectivity (FC).Objectives: To investigate FC changes in the visual networks, their relationship with cortical atrophy, and the association with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.Methods: Ten PCA patients and 28 age-matched controls participated in the study. Using resting state fMRI, we measured FC in ventral and dorsal cortical visual networks, defined on the basis of a priori knowledge of long-range white matter connections. To assess the relationships with AD, we determined AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and FC in the default mode network (DMN), which is vulnerable to AD pathology. Voxel-based morphometry analysis assessed the pattern of grey matter (GM) atrophy.Results: PCA patients showed GM atrophy in bilateral occipital and inferior parietal regions. PCA patients had lower FC levels in a ventral network than controls, but higher FC in inferior components of the dorsal network. In particular, the increased connectivity correlated with greater GM atrophy in occipital regions. All PCA patients had positive cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD; however, FC in global DMN did not differ from controls.Conclusions: FC in PCA reflects brain structure in a non-univocal way. Hyperconnectivity of dorsal networks may indicate aberrant communication in response to posterior brain atrophy or processes of neural resilience during the initial stage of brain dysfunction. The lack of difference from controls in global DMN FC highlights the atypical nature of PCA with respect to typical AD.Show less"

Water Resources Research 19 (3), 718-724.] developed a mathematical model for the transient storage zone to represent the movement of solute from main streams into stagnant zones and back to the main stream. This model calculates the concentrations of a main channel and a storage zone and the transient storage is represented by the mass exchange due to the concentration difference between the stream and the storage zone. Later, Kazezyllmaz-Alhan and Medina (2006) [Kazezyitmaz-Alhan, C.M., Medina Jr., M.A., 2006. Stream solute transport incorporating hyporheic zone processes.

In this study, analytical solutions are derived for both transient storage models for the cases of continuous and finite injections of a tracer. The analytical. solutions provide the researchers with computational speed in obtaining results for contaminant transport problems, and a means to check the validity of the numerical models. The analytical solutions are compared to the numerical solutions for hypothetical problems. Comparison of results shows that the numerical and analytical solutions are in very good agreement.

Streaming potential measurement using electrodes has recently been introduced in the oil reservoirs applications and there are still significant uncertainties during the measurements and interpretation of streaming potential results. The primary purpose of this work is to establish a setup to measure the streaming potential of porous media with low scattering and evaluate voltage measurements based on the paired stabilization and pressure ramping methods. Streaming potential coupling coefficients of 36 samples of sand particle are measured in salinity from 0.0005 M to 0.025 M NaCl solutions. Then, the measured streaming potential coupling coefficients and zeta potential are compared with the published experimental results. Besides the good agreement that was achieved with the published experimental results, much lower scattering in the data points was accomplished for different saline injecting water. An accurate empirical expression is proposed for the measured coupling coefficients which predicts streaming potential coupling coefficients and zeta potential in the salinity range from 0.0001 M to 5.5 M.

Considering that the model requires extensive manipulation in the creation of the packages, a test phase through the seepage package of MODFLOW is carried out with the aim of representing the river package of MODFLOW. FloPy is the tool chosen to develop this implementation due to the versatility of manipulating the packages available in MODFLOW through coding. The obtained results showed a correct implementation of the AHF model using the example of the Biebrza River. The results obtained will enable a better understanding regarding the modelling of the interaction between the river and the aquifer, considering streams with specific geometries where the depth is dimensionally higher than the width.Show less"
47,"David, CH",Apr 2013 ,"Regional-scale river flow modeling using off-the-shelf runoff products, thousands of mapped rivers and hundreds of stream flow gauges",ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"The permanent rivers and streams of the United States - i.e. the ""blue lines"" from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) - maps are available in a Geographic Information System dataset called NHDPlus in which network connectivity for approximately three million reaches is known. The USGS also measures stream flow at about twenty thousand gauges whose locations are known exactly on NHDPlus rivers. The Routing Application for Parallel computation of Discharge (RAPID) is a river network model that can be run on NHDPlus if given inflow to rivers from runoff. The second phase of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS2) provides runoff estimates from four land surface models over the continent. One could therefore combine RAPID with NLDAS2 runoff to compute stream flow in all NHDPlus ""blue lines"" and compare computations with USGS observations over the United States. The work presented here investigates such a combination but focuses on the Texas Gulf Coast Hydrologic Region as a test case for regional-scale river flow modeling using off-the-shelf runoff products, thousands of mapped rivers and hundreds of stream flow gauges. Despite initial difficulties in the determination of water inflow from gridded NLDAS2 runoff datasets to NHDPlus rivers, the ""blue line"" approach is shown to be advantageous partly because hundreds of gauges are easily located on river networks and used throughout basins. Such use of a large number of gauges allows for new investigations related to the analysis of flow computations and to the optimization of model parameters thereby bridging the gap between continental-scale environmental modeling and local-scale planning and decision making. The quality of NLDAS2 runoff relative to locally-calibrated data is assessed through comparison between computed and observed river flow. With the exception of large outliers at a few gauges, the best NLDAS2 runoff products perform similarly to the regional dataset Such outliers prevent the successful optimization of river model parameters but a careful selection of what stations to use for optimization is shown to overcome this difficulty. While river model parameters determined separately for each runoff dataset allow obtaining best results, a single set of parameters is sufficient to assess the relative quality of runoff datasets. The detailed NHDPlus description of river reaches also allows investigating the impact of increased spatial variability in model parameters which following optimization of model computations suggests that those parameters of reaches located on the main stems of large rivers tend to have the largest influence on the quality of flow simulations.

48,"Manning, A",Jul 2020 ,Riparian vegetation as an indicator of stream channel presence and connectivity in arid environments,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,"Stream channels in the American Southwest are misunderstood because they have been understudied and overgeneralized. This misunderstanding has serious consequences for environmental policy, particularly in defining the scope of jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. While the current status of regulations defining the scope of jurisdictional waters is in flux, the currently-codified regulations require that jurisdictional tributaries must have a physical, chemical, or biological connection to downstream traditional navigable waters. The lack of consistent flow in arid stream channels causes misinterpretations of physio-chemical indicators that are commonly used in perennial streams of humid environments. Here we overview the use of riparian vegetation as a biological indicator of stream channel presence and connectivity in arid environments. Based on a thorough literature review and synthesis of arid region studies, we found key spatiotemporal patterns of arid riparian vegetation that could potentially be used to determine hydrologic connectivity. Much of the vegetation along arid stream channels is well-adapted to water scarcity and varies in response to differences in geomorphology, hydrology, and land use across multiple scales. Riparian vegetation in arid environments ranges from hydroriparian to xeroriparian and can include, or be made up exclusively, of upland species. Regardless of species type, plants near stream channels tend to be denser and larger than upland plants. Access to reliable water results in denser, larger plants and more water-dependent species. To demonstrate the potential of riparian vegetation as an indicator of connectivity, we conclude with a case study of Little Sycamore Wash in northern Arizona. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to (1) distinguish between riparian and upland vegetation, and (2) assess connectivity of patches of riparian vegetation. By understanding the spatiotemporal variability of riparian vegetation along arid stream channels, we can make better decisions on their regulation and management.Show less"
