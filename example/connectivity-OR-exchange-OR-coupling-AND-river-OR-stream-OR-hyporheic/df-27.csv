0,"Van Looy, K",Sep 2006 ,Order and disorder in the river continuum: the contribution of continuity and connectivity to floodplain meadow biodiversity,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Aspects of connectivity and continuity operating in the River Meuse were analysed for their contribution to the biodiversity of the floodplain. From this analysis of the diversity and composition of the meadow communities, we aimed to derive effective biodiversity conservation strategies.The River Meuse is one of the larger rivers in the European Western Plains ecoregion. The alluvial plains of the river have a long history of cultivation, and for these plains the floodplain meadow vegetation is a highly appreciated and valuable nature conservation asset.We sampled floodplain meadows from 400 km of the six geomorphic reaches of the middle to lower course of the River Meuse. For each, 50 vascular plant releves were recorded, representing the spectrum of floodplain meadow communities of that reach. Beta diversity was calculated to quantify similarity in species pools between the reaches. A dissimilarity formula was used to determine the turnover between the reaches, and these dissimilarities were compared with a Mantel test to detect whether species composition of the floodplain meadows exhibited connectivity and continuity between the reaches. Species richness for the floodplain vegetation data of the reaches was compared with data for riparian invertebrate communities. The vegetation data sets were ordinated using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to reveal patterns in the floodplain meadow species composition, and the DCA axes were related to plant functional groups and population strategies. The axis scores of the species and plots were linked to river and plant species traits.We did not observe an overall continuity trend in similarity, nor one in diversity in a downstream direction. Lateral connectivity was highlighted by the dissimilarity between the reaches and in the influxes of species from adjacent ecoregions. The DCA ordination showed statistically significant separations between reaches and between the plant functional groups. The second DCA axis related to the longitudinal gradient of the river, whereas the first axis showed stronger correlations with river and plant species traits. We termed this axis the 'disorder axis'. Plant invaders and avoiders are located at the left side of the disorder axis, whereas the true river-adapted categories of resisters and endurers are at the right extremity. Contributions to the disorder were identified in terms of connectivity with adjacent ecoregions and the physical disturbance regime of natural and anthropogenic perturbations, resulting in community changes between the reaches.We concluded that a single overall strategy for biodiversity conservation of the river or its floodplains is not feasible. Strategies can, however, be derived for separate river reaches based on functional groups in the communities, the disorder characteristics of the reach, and the influence of surrounding ecoregions.Show less"
1,"Sonke, W",Feb 2022 ,Alluvial connectivity in multi-channel networks in rivers and estuaries,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Channels in rivers and estuaries are the main paths of fluvial and tidal currents that transport sediment through the system. While network representations of multi-channel systems and their connectivity are quite useful for characterisation of braiding patterns and dynamics, the recognition of channels and their properties is complicated because of the large bed elevation variations, such as shallow shoals and bed steps that render channels visually disconnected. We present and analyse two mathematically rigorous methods to identify channel networks from a terrain model of the river bed. Both methods construct a dense network of locally steepest-descent channels from saddle points on the terrain, and select a subset of channels with a certain minimum sediment volume between them. This is closely linked to the main mechanism of channel formation and change by displacement of sediment volume. The two methods differ in how they compute these sediment volumes: either globally through the entire length of the river, or locally. We compare the methods for the measured bathymetry of the Western Scheldt estuary, The Netherlands, over the past decades. The global method is overly sensitive to small changes elsewhere in the network compared to the local method. We conclude that the local method works best conceptually and for stability reasons. The associated concept of alluvial connectivity between channels in a network is thus the inverse of the volume of sediment that must be displaced to merge the channels. Our method opens up possibilities for new analyses as shown in two examples. First, it shows a clear pattern of scale dependence on volume of the total network length and of the number of nodes by a power law relation, showing that the smaller channels are relatively much shorter. Second, channel bifurcations were found to be predominantly mildly asymmetrical, which is unexpected from fluvial bifurcation theory.Show less"
2,"Vauclin, S",Jun 2020 ,Effects of river infrastructures on the floodplain sedimentary environment in the Rhone River,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"Purpose River infrastructures such as dikes, groynes, and dams are ubiquitous on most large rivers, and although their consequences on the riverbed morphology have often been studied, the effect they might have on the river floodplain and margins remains largely unknown. By investigating the structure and composition of floodplain sediments in three areas along the Rhone River that were extensively engineered during the last 150 years, this paper aims to understand whether river infrastructures might systematically induce a change in sedimentation patterns in the river margins. Materials and methods A total of fifteen sediment cores were sampled in three distinct reaches of the Rhone valley downstream of Lyon. They were thoroughly analyzed in terms of grain size, using heatmap representations and end-member analysis. Six metallic elements (Zn, Cr, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cd) were systematically quantified. In six out of the fifteen cores, total organic carbon (TOC), organic contaminants (PCBs) concentrations, and(137)Cs activity were also assessed. Results and discussion A sharp change in grain size distribution is consistently identified in the sediment cores of all three study reaches. The sediments above this change are fine (D-50 < 100 mu m), poorly classified and homogenous. They also show a relative increase in contamination when compared with deeper sediments. We interpret this change in sediment characteristics as the consequence of an abrupt decrease in connectivity between the floodplain and the river channel, likely due to the implementation of navigation infrastructures in the channel in the second half of the nineteenth century. In one case, the dating of the sediment cores allows linking the grain size change to the implementation of navigation infrastructures in the channel. In the other study areas, the effect of engineering seems delayed in time due to local variability. Conclusions The implementation of river infrastructures resulted in a loss of connectivity between the floodplain and the channel. This was reflected as the homogenization of the floodplain sedimentary environment of the Rhone River all along its course from Lyon to the sea. A similar phenomenon might be present in most engineered rivers across Europe.Show less"
3,"Jumani, S",Mar 2022 ,A new index to quantify longitudinal river fragmentation: Conservation and management implications,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The proliferation of river infrastructure projects has altered aquatic longitudinal connectivity, posing a growing threat to riverine biodiversity and ecosystem processes worldwide. Effective methods to quantify loss of river connectivity across spatiotemporal scales and in data-limited landscapes are important to understand and inform basin-wide conservation and development planning. Here we introduce a Catchment Area-based Fragmentation Index (CAFI) and its derivative, the Catchment Area-and Rainfall-based Fragmentation Index (CARFI) as new metrics to quantify river fragmentation. These indices use catchment area as a proxy for riverine habitat availability, avoiding the drawbacks of existing metrics that rely on river length and associated derivatives. CAFI/CARFI can be computed across spatiotemporal scales, incorporate barrier passability values, assesses the cumulative impact of multiple barriers, and be applied even in data-limited environments. We first applied CAFI and CARFI to a simulated network to illustrate their properties with respect to the number and location of barriers and compared these results to the widely applied Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI). While all indices varied with barrier addition, CAFI and CARFI were more sensitive to both barrier number and location. Next, we illustrated the utility of CAFI and CARFI through case studies in two contrasting settings: the Klamath River in California, where dam building has ceased (and dam removals are being considered) and the Netravathi River in India, where dam building is ongoing, with 65 dams proposed for future development. Results indicate that CAFI and CARFI can effectively quantify trends in fragmentation across spatial scales and temporal scenarios of dam development (i.e. descriptive applications) and can aid the prioritization of sites for dam removal, restoration, or conservation (i.e. prescriptive applications). Overall, these indices can quantify the impacts of individual dams and assess a range of development scenarios to inform basin-wide conservation and development planning.Show less"
4,"Si, W",Apr 2019 ,A bivariable coupling model for river channel routing developed from the flow continuity equation and its application,WATER SA,"In this study, a bivariable coupling model for river channel routing is presented. The proposed model is developed from the Priessmann 4-point implicit differential scheme with a weight coefficient of river flow continuity equation. It is based on the transformation of two different expression forms of river channel storage equation. Furthermore, we consider the impact of lateral inflow along the study river channel from another perspective. In this paper we deduct lateral inflow from the lower section instead of adding lateral inflow to the upper section. In order to be representative of geographical range, river channel characteristics, flood magnitude, hydraulic characteristics and time, the proposed model is tested in 38 river channels of 6 river systems in China by using observed data during flood season. The rationality of model structure and the validity of model simulation are examined comprehensively. Comparison between the proposed model and Muskingum model shows that the proposed model can improve the simulation accuracy. The results show that the simulation accuracy and stability of the bivariable coupling model is much better than that of the Muskingum model.Show less"
5,"Stutter, M",Nov 15 2021 ,Spatial representation of in-stream sediment phosphorus release combining channel network approaches and in-situ experiments,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Impairment of rivers by elevated phosphorus (P) concentration is an issue often studied at outlets of mesoscale catchments. Our objective was to evaluate within-catchment spatio-temporal processes along connected reaches to understand processes of internal P loading associated with sediment input, accumulations in channels and sediment-water column P exchange. Our overall hypothesis was that heterogeneous sediment residence within the channel of a 52 km(2) mixed land cover catchment resulted in key zones for sediment-water P exchange. We evaluated the channel network through ground-survey, spatial data methods establishing connectivity and energy gradients. This gave a background to understand sampling of sediments and P release/uptake to the water column using 90 s in-situ resuspension isolating a portion of streambed over five sets of three-location transects in May (spring storms, recent active erosion) and September (summer low flow, longer sediment residence). Simple transect position models (top, mid, bottom) predicted increased sediment resuspension yields and P contents in lower settings. Sediment P release following resuspension were mean (and range) 0.5 (-0.8 to 1.8) and 0.5 (-2.5 to 3.6) mg soluble reactive P/m2 bed in May and September, respectively, strengthening generally down the transects but inconsistently. Relationships (log form) showed a steepening rise in fine sediments, P content, background and disturbance-released dissolved P, with specific stream power < 40 W/m(2). In-situ methods showed sediments dominantly (12 cases May, 13 cases Sep) as P sources capable of influencing dissolved P concentrations and with potential explanation that heterogeneous locations of internal P loading influence the systems longer-term observed P trends. Combining channel network, stream power assessment and in-situ sorption studies improved the understanding of influential zones of sediment-water P exchange within this mesoscale catchment. Such methods have potential to inform P model development and management. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
6,"Andreazzini, MJ",Apr 2021 ,"Development and application of a sediment connectivity index to small fluvial catchments: a case study in Arenoso stream, Cordoba, Argentina",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Sedimentological connectivity is associated with the degree of linkage between sediment sources and downslope areas. In this study, a connectivity index is proposed to estimate the contribution of different parts of a basin as sources of sediments and to assess the pathway of sediment flux. A small granitic basin located on the eastern slope of the Comechingones Ranges (Cordoba Province, Argentina), was selected as a case study. The semi-quantitative connectivity index is defined by the equation CI=T+Dd+C-B, in which T is the variable toposequences that represents the types of storage and lateral links; Dd is the drainage density and it is used to evaluate the longitudinal links; C corresponds to the number of connections between channels of different order in a basin and it complements Dd in the longitudinal links analysis; and B connotes barriers associated with the number and type of disconnections in the drainage network, thus its sign is negative. From cartographic and field data, a detailed lithological-geomorphological survey was carried out; storage and toposequence types were described, and the barriers were classified according to the type, size, and position in the basin. The CI was determined for each secondary and main sub-basin of the Arenoso stream. Therefore, five connectivity classes were defined from the CI values obtained. This methodology allows arising acceptable results in research associated with the spatial heterogeneity of basin connectivity. The CI developed, in this first approach, showed satisfactory results and is applicable to analysis of small mountain basins, being based mainly on geological-geomorphological-hydrographic maps coupled with detailed fieldwork.Show less"

8,"McCullough, IM",Dec 2022 ,Freshwater corridors in the conterminous United States: A coarse-filter approach based on lake-stream networks,ECOSPHERE,"Maintaining regional-scale freshwater connectivity is challenging due to the dendritic, easily fragmented structure of freshwater networks, but is essential for promoting ecological resilience under climate change. Although the importance of stream network connectivity has been recognized, lake-stream network connectivity has largely been ignored. Furthermore, protected areas are generally not designed to maintain or encompass entire freshwater networks. We applied a coarse-filter approach to identify potential freshwater corridors for diverse taxa by calculating connectivity scores for 385 lake-stream networks across the conterminous United States based on network size, structure, resistance to fragmentation, and dam prevalence. We also identified 2080 disproportionately important lakes for maintaining intact networks (i.e., hubs; 2% of all network lakes) and analyzed the protection status of hubs and potential freshwater corridors. Just 3% of networks received high connectivity scores based on their large size and structure (medians of 1303 lakes, 498.6 km north-south stream distance), but these also contained a median of 454 dams. In contrast, undammed networks (17% of networks) were considerably smaller (medians of six lakes, 7.2 km north-south stream distance), indicating that the functional connectivity of the largest potential freshwater corridors in the conterminous United States currently may be diminished compared with smaller, undammed networks. Network lakes and hubs were protected at similar rates nationally across different levels of protection (8%-18% and 6%-20%, respectively), but were generally more protected in the western United States. Our results indicate that conterminous United States protection of major freshwater corridors and the hubs that maintain them generally fell short of the international conservation goal of protecting an ecologically representative, well-connected set of fresh waters (& GE;17%) by 2020 (Aichi Target 11). Conservation planning efforts might consider focusing on restoring natural hydrologic connectivity at or near hubs, particularly in larger networks, less protected, or biodiverse regions, to support freshwater biodiversity conservation under climate change.Show less"
9,"Schmadel, NM",Jul 17 2018 ,Thresholds of lake and reservoir connectivity in river networks control nitrogen removal,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Lakes, reservoirs, and other ponded waters are ubiquitous features of the aquatic landscape, yet their cumulative role in nitrogen removal in large river basins is often unclear. Here we use predictive modeling, together with comprehensive river water quality, land use, and hydrography datasets, to examine and explain the influences of more than 18,000 ponded waters on nitrogen removal through river networks of the Northeastern United States. Thresholds in pond density where ponded waters become important features to regional nitrogen removal are identified and shown to vary according to a ponded waters' relative size, network position, and degree of connectivity to the river network, which suggests worldwide importance of these new metrics. Consideration of the interacting physical and biological factors, along with thresholds in connectivity, reveal where, why, and how much ponded waters function differently than streams in removing nitrogen, what regional water quality outcomes may result, and in what capacity management strategies could most effectively achieve desired nitrogen loading reduction.Show less"
10,"Liu, XW",Sep 2019 ,"Persistence and migration of tetracycline, sulfonamide, fluoroquinolone, and macrolide antibiotics in streams using a simulated hydrodynamic system",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"The potential persistence and migration of 14 antibiotics comprising sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and tetracyclines were conducted using a 50-d recirculating flume study supported by batch attenuation experiments with spiked concentrations. The study demonstrated that photodegradation was the dominant attenuation process for these antibiotics in the water environment. The half-lives of 2 -26 d were in order of sulfadiazine > sulfadimethoxine > sulfamerazine > sulfamethoxazole > sulfamethazine > sulfathiazole > ofloxacin > enrofloxacin > norfloxacin > ciprofloxacin > erythromycin > tetracycline > roxithromycin > oxytetracycline. These modest half-lives meant that the antibiotics were predicted to travel 30-400 km down a typical river before half the concentration would be lost. All antibiotics were detected on the surface sediment in the flume study. Under hyporheic exchange, some of them continually migrated into the deeper sediment and also the sediment pore water. All fluoroquinolones were detected in the sediments. The sulfonamides were detected in the pore water with relatively high concentrations and frequencies. Sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine and sulfathiazole in the upper layer pore water were found to be approaching equilibrium with the surface water. The high presence of sulfonamides in the pore water indicated that their high mobility and persistence potentially pose a risk to hyporheic zone. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
11,"Truchy, A",Jun 2020 ,"Habitat patchiness, ecological connectivity and the uneven recovery of boreal stream ecosystems from an experimental drought",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Ongoing climate change is increasing the occurrence and intensity of drought episodes worldwide, including in boreal regions not previously regarded as drought prone, and where the impacts of drought remain poorly understood. Ecological connectivity is one factor that might influence community structure and ecosystem functioning post-drought, by facilitating the recovery of sensitive species via dispersal at both local (e.g. a nearby habitat patch) and regional (from other systems within the same region) scales. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we investigated how impacts of drought on boreal stream ecosystems are altered by the spatial arrangement of local habitat patches within stream channels, and variation in ecological connectivity with a regional species pool. We measured basal ecosystem processes underlying carbon and nutrient cycling: (a) algal biomass accrual; (b) microbial respiration; and (c) decomposition of organic matter, and sampled communities of aquatic fungi and benthic invertebrates. An 8-day drought event had strong impacts on both community structure and ecosystem functioning, including algal accrual, leaf decomposition and microbial respiration, with many of these impacts persisting even after water levels had been restored for 3.5 weeks. Enhanced connectivity with the regional species pool and increased aggregation of habitat patches also affected multiple response variables, especially those associated with microbes, and in some cases reduced the effects of drought to a small extent. This indicates that spatial processes might play a role in the resilience of communities and ecosystem functioning, given enough time. These effects were however insufficient to facilitate significant recovery in algal growth before seasonal dieback began in autumn. The limited resilience of ecosystem functioning in our experiment suggests that even short-term droughts can have extended consequences for stream ecosystems in the world's vast boreal region, and especially on the ecosystem processes and services mediated by algal biofilms.Show less"
12,"Lobera, G",Jan 20 2021 ,Responses of resources and consumers to experimental flow pulses in a temporary Mediterranean stream,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Determining the resistance and resilience of resources and benthic invertebrates connected to instream refuges and species re-colonization in post-flood periods may help to elucidate mechanisms behind community recovery. This experiment simulated flow pulses in a small temporary stream in an extremely wet year, using upstream control and downstream flooded reaches at three sites in order to assess community resistance and resilience (benthos and drift), and analyse resources (periphyton and benthic organic matter) and invertebrates at pre- and post-flood time periods. The hyporheos was sampled in order to explore species exchanges with benthos. Fewer resources and benthic invertebrates at the beginning of the experiment were found than in previous studies when base flow conditions prevailed. Resource stocks and benthic invertebrates showed high resistance to the flow pulse. Interestingly, there was low resilience of benthic organic matter to natural seasonal flooding. Chlorophyll a did not recover after experimental floods; instead, it was reduced after floods, despite the more benign flow conditions and non-limiting irradiance levels, pointing to top-down control by consumers. Additionally, the experimental flood significantly disturbed only the invertebrate composition in the groundwater-fed stream, which was inhabited by the fewest adapted-to-flood-disturbances macroinvertebrates. Despite the low resilience observed, richness and densities of benthos increased during the study, evidencing progressive colonization. Around 50-60% of macroinvertebrates were present in both benthos and hyporheos. Richness increased after flooding, suggesting that the hyporheic zone could be the main source of colonizers. Three species traits characterized the hyporheos: small size, cocoons and feeders of microorganisms within the fine sediment matrix. The main results indicate that longer-than-normal flood periods in early spring may constrain invertebrate succession before the next summer drought in temporary streams. This study underscores the importance of hyporheic fauna as a significance source of colonizers, highlighting the importance of connectivity to the groundwater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

13,"Bobeldyk, AM",2005 ,Secondary spread of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in coupled lake-stream systems,ECOSCIENCE,"We postulated that dispersal through streams is an important factor in the spread of nonindigenous aquatic species to uninvaded lakes. We tested this hypothesis with zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), whose plank-tonic larvae are particularly prone to transport through streams. To examine this potential mechanism of spread, we (1) assessed populations of zebra mussels in 2000 and 2003 in coupled lake-stream systems of the St. Joseph River basin (Indiana and Michigan, USA) and (2) examined the interconnectedness of lake-stream systems by evaluating all invaded inland lakes and reservoirs in the United States. We compared observed patterns in zebra mussel populations in 2000 and 2003 to patterns predicted by two proposed models of spread: the static source-sink model and the progressive downstream-march model. Adult zebra mussel densities in lake outflows declined with distance downstream of invaded lakes. Maximum downstream occurrences of adults were variable over the years surveyed, but did not increase through time, suggesting that the source-sink model best fit zebra mussel distributions in these lake-stream couplets. For the conterminous US, we examined the connectedness of inland lakes in close proximity to invaded takes to determine if stream connections were related to invasions. We also measured the distances between invaded lakes and downstream lakes that were potential recipients of colonists to examine the importance of stream distance in relation to zebra mussel invasions. Lakes connected to invaded lakes were more likely to be invaded than non-connected lakes, and the probability of becoming invaded increased with the proximity between lakes. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the role that streams play as pathways for new biological invasions is crucial for directing management and prevention efforts.Show less"
14,"Lorion, CM",Aug 2011 ,"Altitudinal gradients in stream fish diversity and the prevalence of diadromy in the Sixaola River basin, Costa Rica",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,"Landscape-scale patterns of freshwater fish diversity and assemblage structure remain poorly documented in many areas of Central America, while aquatic ecosystems throughout the region have been impacted by habitat degradation and hydrologic alterations. Diadromous fishes may be especially vulnerable to these changes, but there is currently very little information available regarding their distribution and abundance in Central American river systems. We sampled small streams at 20 sites in the Sixaola River basin in southeastern Costa Rica to examine altitudinal variation in the diversity and species composition of stream fish assemblages, with a particular focus on diadromous species. A set of environmental variables was also measured in the study sites to evaluate how changes in fish assemblage structure were related to gradients in stream habitat. Overall, fish diversity and abundance declined steeply with increasing elevation, with very limited species turnover. The contribution of diadromous fishes to local species richness and abundance increased significantly with elevation, and diadromous species dominated assemblages at the highest elevation sites. Ordination of the sampling sites based on fish species composition generally arranged sites by elevation, but also showed some clustering based on geographic proximity. The dominant gradient in fish community structure was strongly correlated with an altitudinal habitat gradient identified through ordination of the environmental variables. The variation we observed in stream fish assemblages over relatively small spatial scales has significant conservation implications and highlights the ecological importance of longitudinal connectivity in Central American river systems.Show less"
15,"Phillips, CB",Dec 2019 ,"Fine-Particle Deposition, Retention, and Resuspension Within a Sand-Bedded Stream Are Determined by Streambed Morphodynamics",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Fine-particle dynamics occupy an integral role in nutrient, contaminant, and pathogen transport in rivers. Due to low settling velocities, fine particles are often treated as if they pass through the river without interacting significantly with bed sediments. However, fine particles are advected toward and into the bed by turbulence and hyporheic exchange, leading to deposition by filtration. Extensive remobilization of fine particles is commonly observed during high flow conditions, but these dynamics are not well understood. Here we analyze the remobilization of fine tracer particles within the context of sediment morphodynamics during an experimental flood. Field data collected within Clear Run, a sand-bedded stream, by Harvey et al. (2012, ) represent subsurface and water column time series of solute and fine particulate tracers. Overhead time lapse photography of the motion and growth of bed forms during the flood are used to extract and quantify morphodynamics, which we relate to the resuspension of fine particles by transforming bed form wavelength statistics into scour depth through a set of geometric relations derived from laboratory experiments. Particles deposited near the bed surface such that scour from larger bed forms remobilized the majority of particles within the streambed (>72%) accounting for the increase in resuspended fine particles during the flood. This analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of bed form dynamics and scour is necessary for understanding the remobilization of fine particles in Clear Run and that interpreting fine-particle dynamics during and beyond the event scale requires coupling with bed morphodynamics.Show less"
16,"Rodriguez-Lloveras, X",Apr 2020 ,"Impacts of sediment connectivity on Holocene alluvial records across a Mediterranean basin (Guadalentin River, SE-Spain)",CATENA,"Two contiguous alluvial valleys (Maria and Guadalupe sectors) of the upper Guadalentin River (SE Spain) show distinct Holocene alluvial architecture (cut-and-fill, nested and stepped fill terraces), revealing a strong control of valley morphology and bedrock barriers on sediment delivery, storage and preservation. The headwater valley (Maria sector) preserves four morphosedimentary alluvial units corresponding to two palaeogeographic stages. Morphosedimentary unit (MSU1), the most extensive, is a major depositional valley infill dominated by sand and silt texture, showing three stratigraphic sets dated 9000-8500, 5300-4800, 4000-3000 cal BP. This vertically stacked alluvial accumulation occurs upstream of a narrow bedrock channel, that limited sediment connectivity with the downstream Guadalupe sector. Between 3000 and 2350 cal BP, a 15-m deep incision on MSU1 occurred, and subsequent cut-and-fill cycles generated three alluvial terraces dated at 2350-1900 cal BP (MSU2), 1800-700 cal BP (MSU3), and post-400 years (MSU4). In the downstream valley (Guadalupe sector), six flights of alluvial terraces (MSUg1 to MSUg6) were formed by episodic aggradation and quasi-continuous incision, in response to baselevel changes of the lower Guadalentin River during the Holocene. Alluvial chronologies in these two contiguous valleys show out-of-phase sedimentation periods under low connectivity conditions (9-3 ka), and in-phase cut-and-fill cycles after valley re-connection (post-3.0 ka). The late Holocene alluvial activity periods also coincide with morpho-stratigraphic data from the lower Guadalentin, indicating that fluvial connectivity throughout the catchment was only completed in the late Holocene.Show less"
17,"Gonzalez-Pinzon, R",Sep 2014 ,Quantifying spatial differences in metabolism in headwater streams,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Stream functioning includes simultaneous interaction among solute transport, nutrient processing, and metabolism. Metabolism is measured with methods that have limited spatial representativeness and are highly uncertain. These problems restrict development of methods for up-scaling biological processes that mediate nutrient processing. We used the resazurin-resorufin (Raz-Rru) tracer system to estimate metabolism at different spatial scales (habitat, subreach, and reach) in 2 headwater streams of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, USA), and present a mathematical framework for its application. We investigated the relationship between metabolism and hydrodynamics, i.e., geomorphic units (e.g., pool-riffle, pool-cascade), bed materials (i.e., alluvium vs bedrock channels), and type of transient storage (i.e., pure hyporheic exchange, pure surface transient storage, and a combination of both). The metabolic hotspots detected by the Raz-Rru system in both watersheds were related to hydrodynamic conditions known to increase biological processing. Higher respiration rate coefficients were found in subreaches with extensive hyporheic flow and flow through large woody-debris complexes, and higher reaeration rate coefficients were found in subreaches with intensive respiration activity and higher flow velocities. Because such hydrodynamic conditions and their effects on stream processing are difficult to quantify in headwater streams without the use of tracer techniques, the Raz-Rru system proved to be a good integrator of solute transport and stream metabolism processes.Show less"
18,"Robinson, SJ",Dec 2015 ,Statistical description of wetland hydrological connectivity to the River Murray in South Australia under both natural and regulated conditions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The effect of river regulation on the connectivity of the South Australian River Murray to its floodplain wetlands was examined using unregulated 'natural' and 'regulated' river flow data simulated between the years 1895 to 2009. A sample of 185 wetlands was used to calculate a range of connectivity statistics under both simulation scenarios. These statistics summarised the timing and duration of both connection and disconnection, as well as inundated area. Wetlands ranged from being permanently inundated, connected multiple times per year due to both small fluctuations in river level and the annual flood pulse, to flooded with diminishing frequency depending on the size of the annual flood pulse and their position on the floodplain. Under the natural scenario a wide range of wetland connectivity profiles were recorded whereas under the regulated scenario wetlands tended to be either permanently inundated or infrequently flooded. Under natural conditions wetlands that required higher flow before connecting were less frequently connected and for shorter periods. Under regulated conditions a larger proportion of wetland area was permanently connected than under natural conditions, however the annual flood pulse connected a larger area of wetlands under natural conditions. The information derived from this analysis can be used to design wetland management plans for individual wetlands within a river-wide management regime restoring lost hydrological variability.

Taking the Wuding River watershed (one of the largest tributaries of the Yellow River) as an example, we used the coupling coordination model to analyze the coupling coordination relationship of the water-ecology-economy system between 2001 and 2020, and then used grey correlation and partial correlation analyses to explore the main influencing factors and cross-county characteristic of the coupling coordination. The results show that the water, ecology and economy subsystems changed slightly before 2007. After 2007, the economy developed rapidly, while the water and ecology increased for a short time and then decreased after 2013. The water-ecology-economy coupling coordination was on the verge of dysfunctional decline. Water and ecology were the main influencing factors on the coupling coordination. The coupling coordination showed a cross-county characteristic. Water and ecology in upstream counties had significant positive correlations with the coupling coordination in downstream counties. The economy subsystem in upstream counties, however, had significant negative correlations with water and ecology in downstream counties. Our findings provide an empirical mode to measure transregional characteristics of coupling coordination and could support the construction of a coordination governance mode in the Wuding River watershed.Show less"

The proposed models emphasize morphologies and adjustments in a historical scale, using inherited surface covers, climatic dynamics, lithology and land use transformations as controls, coupled with landscape intrinsic hydrological processes. Fluvial impediments were mapped, followed by their classification, based on the distribution between landscape compartments and connection processes. The first-order tributaries of the Salamanca River rise from the entrenchment of sedimentary deposits at the base of the escarpment or downstream of talus deposits, resulting in different hollow filling configurations and different paleoconectivity evolution scenarios. Gorge valley stretches, downstream, lead to the confinement of the flow, accelerating connectivity, with a predominance of vertical erosion. The most expressive disconnection element of anthropogenic origin in the Salamanca River watershed is an artificial canal, part of the project for transposing the waters of the Sao Francisco River to smaller watersheds in the state of Ceara. The raceway borders the sedimentary plateau, modifying or obstructing the flow of lower order drainages and obliterating the laminar flow hillslopes to their base levels. In the Peripheral Depression (Vale do Cariri), fluvial morphologies alternate sequences of arroyos (channeled stretches) and floodouts (non-channeled stretches), controlled by the ""cut and fill"" dynamics prevalent in alluvial plains.

The Yangtze River Delta is one of the most important regions for China's sustainable development. It is of great significance to study the coupling coordinated development level of water-energy-food-ecology in the Yangtze River Delta for sustainable development. In this study, we establish the water-energy-food-ecology (WEFE) coupling and coordination development index system. Then, we analyze the degree of coupling coordination (DCC) of WEFE based on the coupling coordination evaluation model and projection pursuit model. The results show that the DCC of WEFE in the Yangtze River Delta shows obvious spatial-temporal characteristics. From the temporal view, the DCC in the Yangtze River Delta has shown an upward trend; from the spatial view, the DCC of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang is higher than that of Shanghai.Show less"
22,"Paillex, A",Feb 2013 ,Functional diversity in a large river floodplain: anticipating the response of native and alien macroinvertebrates to the restoration of hydrological connectivity,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Rivers and floodplains are among the most threatened ecosystems. Hydroelectric power plants and embankments have reduced the hydrological connectivity between rivers and their floodplain channels, leading to loss of freshwater habitats and biological communities. To prevent and reverse such loss, numerous restoration programmes have aimed at rejuvenating the lateral hydrological connectivity between rivers and floodplain channels. Despite considerable global attention, we know remarkably little about the ecological benefits of floodplain restoration programmes. We analysed the functional diversity of different macroinvertebrate groups (natives and aliens) along a gradient of lateral hydrological connectivity on the Rhone river in France. We used 36 sampling sites to describe the functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) before and after the enhancement of the lateral hydrological connectivity by restoration. The effects of restoration on functional diversity were tested for each macroinvertebrate group and at multiple spatial levels (alpha and beta). Before restoration, alpha functional diversity of the entire macroinvertebrate community peaked in sites with a high lateral connectivity. The contribution of the native groups to functional diversity was higher than that of the alien group. The latter was not constrained by high values of lateral hydrological connectivity and reached a maximum in highly connected sites. After restoration, within-site functional diversity (alpha FD) declined linearly following the enhancement of lateral hydrological connectivity. The restoration operations increased the contribution of the aliens to functional diversity and reduced the contribution of a group of native taxa. In addition, among-sites functional diversity (beta FD) was successfully enlarged by restoration. Synthesis and applications. The lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) represents a key parameter for explaining the functional diversity (FD) of macroinvertebrates in a floodplain ecosystem. Our results demonstrate that restoration-induced changes to functional diversity can be predicted. Controversially, restoration-induced enhancement of lateral hydrological connectivity increased the functional diversity of the alien macroinvertebrates. However, these species contributed only to a small part of the total macroinvertebrate functional diversity. We recommend that restoration programmes diversify the levels of lateral hydrological connectivity among the channels to ensure an optimal functional diversity at the floodplain scale.Show less"
23,"Shaw, EA",Jun 2016 ,Importance of partial barriers and temporal variation in flow when modelling connectivity in fragmented river systems,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"(1) The potential for catchment-scale connectivity modelling to help plan the restoration of connectivity in fragmented river systems is not yet well understood. In the present study the importance of two interrelated aspects of such modelling in determining predictions of connectivity are explored: (1) uncertainty in the passability of partial barriers (such as fish passes) and how the passabilities of series of partial barriers combine, and (2) temporal variation in connectivity due to flow.(2) Connectivity for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) are modelled under alternative restoration strategies in the heavily impounded Don Catchment UK using two different methods for simulating the combined passability of series of partial barriers. Catchment-scale hydraulic and connectivity modelling were integrated using a novel method to account for the effect of flow on connectivity, achieved by consideration of flow-fish pass efficiency relationships and the treatment of gaps between habitat patches as partial barrier.(3) Modelled connectivity is very sensitive to uncertainty in barrier passability and the method used to simulate the combined passability of series of partial barriers. Flow also has a strong and complex effect on connectivity, with predicted temporal patterns being particularly dependent on how the combined impact of series of barriers is modelled. The sensitivity of the modelling constrains its capacity to predict the outcome of alternative connectivity restoration strategies. Nevertheless it does serve as a tool to think critically about connectivity restoration. If applied thoughtfully in full awareness of its limitations it can still be used assist in the planning and appraisal of alternative restoration options.(4) The modelling also provides a number of important practical insights. It shows that series of fish passes may be ineffective unless they operate at very high efficiencies. Small changes to flow-fish pass efficiency relationships can have a large effect on temporal patterns in connectivity. Overall fish pass efficiency is comprised of attraction and passage efficiencies which may differ in the extent to which they are determined by random processes. This likely has significant implications for the nature of the combined passability of series of fish passes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.Show less"

25,"Hassan, MA",Mar 15 2019 ,Variable hillslope-channel coupling and channel characteristics of forested mountain streams in glaciated landscapes,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Channel morphology of forested, mountain streams in glaciated landscapes is regulated by a complex suite of processes, and remains difficult to predict. Here, we analyze models of channel geometry against a comprehensive field dataset collected in two previously glaciated basins in Haida Gwaii, B.C., to explore the influence of variable hillslope-channel coupling imposed by the glacial legacy on channel form. Our objective is to better understand the relation between hillslope-channel coupling and stream character within glaciated basins. We find that the glacial legacy on landscape structure is characterized by relatively large spatial variation in hillslope-channel coupling. Spatial differences in coupling influence the frequency and magnitude of coarse sediment and woody material delivery to the channel network. Analyses using a model for channel gradient and multiple models for width and depth show that hillslope-channel coupling and high wood loading induce deviations from standard downstream predictions for all three variables in the study basins. Examination of model residuals using Boosted Regression Trees and nine additional channel variables indicates that similar to 10 to similar to 40% of residual variance can be explained by logjam variables, similar to 15-40% by the degree of hillslope-channel coupling, and 10-20% by proximity to slope failures. These results indicate that channel classification systems incorporating hillslope-channel coupling, and, indirectly, the catchment glacial legacy, may present a more complete understanding of mountain channels. From these results, we propose a conceptual framework which describes the linkages between landscape history, hillslope-channel coupling, and channel form. (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
26,"Ren, JH",Jul 2002 ,Effects of background water composition on stream-subsurface exchange of submicron colloids,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE,"While very fine sediments (colloids) are normally assumed to be readily transported downstream without deposition, recent evidence suggests that these particles will often deposit into streambeds due to a combination of physical and chemical mechanisms. This study investigates a regime of particle deposition where settling is unimportant and thus where particle deposition can only result from advective stream-subsurface exchange followed by deep-bed filtration. Laboratory flume experiments were conducted to examine the deposition of 0.45 mum diameter silica colloids into a silica sand bed. This system was selected for study because submicron sized colloids will not settle and silica colloid filtration by silica sand is generally quite low. Despite the lack of settling and the weak particle-particle interactions, the ongoing interfacial flux of colloids to the subsurface still produced significant filtration of silica colloids over the course of the experiments. Variation of the background ionic strength caused significant modification of filtration behavior and silica colloid deposition. In addition, cleaning the sand surface with mild acid and base washes reduced both filtration and net colloid exchange. These experimental results are interpreted in terms of a fundamentally based physicochemical model which predicts net particle deposition based on stream and subsurface hydrodynamic conditions and subsurface filtration. These results show that both particle surface chemical conditions and background water chemistry play a critical role in controlling the net transport and deposition of fine sediments. It is important to recognize the effects of physicochemical processes both when designing laboratory experiments and when analyzing environmental particle transport.Show less"
27,"Timoner, X",Aug 2012 ,"Functional responses of stream biofilms to flow cessation, desiccation and rewetting",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Mediterranean climate regions are characterised by long summer droughts that usually involve flow intermittency in low- to mid-order streams. Flow intermittency implies flow cessation, drying and subsequent rewetting of the streambed, and affects both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. The balance between these processes, as well as the balance in the use of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) may change because of the ongoing increase in stream flow intermittency caused by global change in many regions. It is therefore crucial to understand better the consequences of this phenomenon. 2. Our two initial hypotheses were (i) that flow intermittency would impact more on autotrophic than on heterotrophic processes in stream biofilms owing to the higher water dependence of autotrophs, as well as differences in the water storage capacity of the stream biofilm compartments where autotrophic and heterotrophic processes mainly occur (surface cobbles versus hyporheic sediments) and (ii) that the C-N-P use by biofilms would change during the dry period (terrestrial phase) owing to the extreme water stress conditions. These hypotheses were tested by analysing the functional response of the main stream biofilms (epilithic, epipsammic and hyporheic) during flow cessation, desiccation and rewetting in a Mediterranean forested stream. The autotrophic response was characterised through changes in the photon yield, whereas the heterotrophic response was characterised by changes in the extracellular enzyme activities. 3. Streambed desiccation had clear effects on the functioning of stream biofilms. Autotrophic biomass decreased by 80% with streambed desiccation, but recovered rapidly after flow resumption. Heterotrophs were more resistant to water stress, especially in the epipsammic and hyporheic biofilms where bacterial cell density decreased only by 20%. 4. Extracellular enzyme activities remained relatively high, and the balance in the C-N-P use by biofilms changed during the dry period. The C and P breakdown capacities were maintained during dry conditions, especially in the epipsammic and hyporheic biofilms, but the degradation of N compounds sharply decreased. Elemental molar ratios (C:N and C:P) of the different biofilms also changed with streambed desiccation. C:P ratios increased from 80 to 300, while the C:N ratios increased from 10 to 16. 5. Given the contrasting responses of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in the different biofilms, our results suggest that the current increase in flow intermittency extent is likely to increase the relative importance of heterotrophic processes in stream ecosystems, as well as the relative contribution of the hyporheic biofilm to C-N-P use. Our results further suggest that the longer streams remain dry, the more the biofilm stoichiometry will change.Show less"
28,"Abdelaziz, AH",May 2015 ,Learning Dynamic Stream Weights For Coupled-HMM-Based Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING,"With the increasing use of multimedia data in communication technologies, the idea of employing visual information in automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently gathered momentum. In conjunction with the acoustical information, the visual data enhances the recognition performance and improves the robustness of ASR systems in noisy and reverberant environments. In audio-visual systems, dynamic weighting of audio and video streams according to their instantaneous confidence is essential for reliably and systematically achieving high performance. In this paper, we present a complete framework that allows blind estimation of dynamic stream weights for audio-visual speech recognition based on coupled hidden Markov models (CHMMs). As a stream weight estimator, we consider using multilayer perceptrons and logistic functions to map multidimensional reliability measure features to audiovisual stream weights. Training the parameters of the stream weight estimator requires numerous input-output tuples of reliability measure features and their corresponding stream weights. We estimate these stream weights based on oracle knowledge using an expectation maximization algorithm. We define 31-dimensional feature vectors that combine model-based and signal-based reliability measures as inputs to the stream weight estimator. During decoding, the trained stream weight estimator is used to blindly estimate stream weights. The entire framework is evaluated using the Grid audio-visual corpus and compared to state-of-the-art stream weight estimation strategies. The proposed framework significantly enhances the performance of the audio-visual ASR system in all examined test conditions.Show less"
29,"Boxall, GD",May 2008 ,Landscape topography and the distribution of Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi) in a high desert stream,ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,"Lahontan cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi, are currently limited in their distribution to a patchwork of small isolated populations, the result of habitat degradation and natural variation in landscape and in-stream conditions. The objectives of this study were to determine if landscape topography influences trout distribution, and if water temperatures control this response. The work was carried out in a sub-basin of the Quinn River system, McDermitt Creek, which drains the sagebrush desert of southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada. Head-water tributaries of this creek consist of alternating canyon-confined and valley bounded reaches. Trout within these systems are challenged by low discharge and high temperatures during the summer, and anchor ice during the winter. Contiguous whole stream surveys were used to look at trout distribution during the summer of 2003 and spring and fall of 2004. Our results suggested that topography can affect trout distribution. Trout numbers were highest in areas with greater numbers of nick-points (the transition zones between less confined and more confined valley segments) and greater valley confinement. Additionally, in the downstream portion of our headwater reaches, more trout were found in nickpoints than expected based on the availability of this habitat type. Our data suggest that hyporheic inputs may be high in such areas, thus providing trout with shelter from warm water in the summer, anchor ice in the winter, and shallow stream depths during all seasons. Spatial occurrence of these areas of refugia can be taken into consideration when planning land use activities and restoration efforts. Further research is required to confirm that topography can affect the distribution of Lahontan cutthroat trout in other systems, and to better understand the mechanisms behind these patterns.Show less"

31,"Dallmann, J",Dec 16 2021 ,Bedform segregation and locking increase storage of natural and synthetic particles in rivers,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Here the authors show that hyporheic flow, bed morphology, and bed stability are intimately related, and that this relationship is expressed as distinct locked and segregated states of bedform dynamics, which carries implications for river system behavior in general and the storage of carbon, nutrients, and contaminants in particular.While the ecological significance of hyporheic exchange and fine particle transport in rivers is well established, these processes are generally considered irrelevant to riverbed morphodynamics. We show that coupling between hyporheic exchange, suspended sediment deposition, and sand bedform motion strongly modulates morphodynamics and sorts bed sediments. Hyporheic exchange focuses fine-particle deposition within and below mobile bedforms, which suppresses bed mobility. However, deposited fines are also remobilized by bedform motion, providing a mechanism for segregating coarse and fine particles in the bed. Surprisingly, two distinct end states emerge from the competing interplay of bed stabilization and remobilization: a locked state in which fine particle deposition completely stabilizes the bed, and a dynamic equilibrium in which frequent remobilization sorts the bed and restores mobility. These findings demonstrate the significance of hyporheic exchange to riverbed morphodynamics and clarify how dynamic interactions between coarse and fine particles produce sedimentary patterns commonly found in rivers.Show less"
32,"Chen, J",Apr 2018 ,"What Role Does ""Elongation"" Play in ""Tool-Specific"" Activation and Connectivity in the Dorsal and Ventral Visual Streams?",CEREBRAL CORTEX,"Images of tools induce stronger activation than images of nontools in a left-lateralized network that includes ventral-stream areas implicated in tool identification and dorsal-stream areas implicated in tool manipulation. Importantly, however, graspable tools tend to be elongated rather than stubby, and so the tool-selective responses in some of these areas may, to some extent, reflect sensitivity to elongation rather than ""toolness"" per se. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the role of elongation in driving tool-specific activation in the 2 streams and their interconnections. We showed that in some ""tool-selective"" areas, the coding of toolness and elongation coexisted, but in others, elongation and toolness were coded independently. Psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that toolness, but not elongation, had a strong modulation of the connectivity between the ventral and dorsal streams. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that viewing tools (either elongated or stubby) increased the connectivity from the ventral- to the dorsal-stream tool-selective areas, but only viewing elongated tools increased the reciprocal connectivity between these areas. Overall, these data disentangle how toolness and elongation affect the activation and connectivity of the tool network and help to resolve recent controversies regarding the relative contribution of ""toolness"" versus elongation in driving dorsal-stream ""tool-selective"" areas.Show less"

A wide range of field-based techniques are available for such characterization. The objective of this study is to quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of the exchange fluxes along the cakit stream (Nigde, Turkey) through coupling a set of geophysical techniques and in-stream measurements in a hierarchical manner. First, geological and water quality information were combined at the catchment scale to determine key areas for reach-scale focus. Second, electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys were conducted along the reach to pinpoint potential groundwater upwelling locations. EMI anomalies guided our focus to a 665 m-long reach of the stream. Along this selected reach, a fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) system was utilized to investigate streambed temperature profiles at fine spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, vertical hydraulic gradients and exchange fluxes were investigated using nested piezometers and vertical temperature profiles, respectively, at two potential upwelling locations and a potential downwelling location identified by previous surveys. The results of the study reveal heterogeneity of vertical water-flow components with seasonal variability. The EMI survey was successful in identifying a localized groundwater upwelling location. FO-DTS measurements revealed a warm temperature anomaly during cold air temperature and low streamflow conditions at the same upwelling site. Our point-based methods, namely vertical temperature profiles and vertical hydraulic gradient estimates, however, did not always provide consistent results with each other and with EMI and FO-DTS measurements. This study, therefore, highlights the opportunities and challenges in incorporating multi-scale observations in a hierarchical manner in characterization of the GW-SW exchange processes that are known to be highly heterogeneous in time and space. Overall, a combination of different methods helps to overcome the limitations of each single method and increases confidence in the obtained results.Show less"
35,"Cao, ZX",Mar 2002 ,Coupled and decoupled numerical modeling of flow and morphological evolution in alluvial rivers,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Existing numerical river models are mostly built upon asynchronous solution of simplified governing equations. The strong coupling between water flow, sediment transport, and morphological evolution is thus ignored to a certain extent. An earlier study led to the development of a fully coupled model and identified the impacts of simplifications in the water-sediment mixture and global bed material continuity equations as well as of the asynchronous solution procedure for aggradation processes. This paper presents the results of an extended study along this line, highlighting the impacts on both aggradation and degradation processes. Simplifications in the continuity equations for the water-sediment mixture and bed material are found to have negligible effects on degradation. This is, however, in contrast to aggradation processes, in which the errors purely due to simplified continuity equations can be significant transiently. The asynchronous solution procedure is found to entail appreciable inaccuracy for both aggradation and degradation processes. Further, the asynchronous solution procedure can render the physical problem mathematically ill posed by invoking an extra upstream boundary condition in the supercritical flow regime. Finally, the impacts of simplified continuity equations and an asynchronous solution procedure are shown to be comparable with those of largely tuned friction factors, indicating their significance in calibrating numerical river models. It is concluded that the coupled system of complete governing equations needs to be synchronously solved for refined modeling of alluvial rivers.Show less"

These functional networks correspond with broad cognitive domains; for example, the Default-mode network (DMN) is engaged during internally oriented cognition. However, functional networks may contain hierarchical substructures corresponding with more specific cognitive functions. Here, we used individual-specific precision RSFC to test whether network substructures could be identified in 10 healthy human brains. Across all subjects and networks, individualized network subdivisions were more valid-more internally homogeneous and better matching spatial patterns of task activation-than canonical networks. These measures of validity were maximized at a hierarchical scale that contained similar to 83 subnetworks across the brain. At this scale, nine DMN subnetworks exhibited topographical similarity across subjects, suggesting that this approach identifies homologous neurobiological circuits across individuals. Some DMN subnetworks matched known features of brain organization corresponding with cognitive functions. Other subnetworks represented separate streams by which DMN couples with other canonical large-scale networks, including language and control networks. Together, this work provides a detailed organizational framework for studying the DMN in individual humans.Show less"
39,"Wright, N",,An empirical test of groundwater pumping effects on river flow and temperature: Chemainus River case study,CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL,"Groundwater abstraction from pumping wells can reduce the flows and water levels of hydraulically connected surface waters, which can affect aquatic communities and water rights of other users. Four pump tests were implemented in the 2016 summer low-flow period to measure groundwater pumping effects to Chemainus River surface water flow and temperature. The effect of pumping on surface flow was estimated using four metrics based on differences between measured and predicted flow at a hydrometric gauge located 340 m from the groundwater wells. Differences were estimated as residuals from a regression model relating flow at this gauge to flow at a gauge 1.3 km upstream of the wells. The effect of pumping on surface water temperature was assessed using daily maximum and daily average water temperature at gauges located 340 m and 1.4 km downstream of the wells. An effect of pumping on river flow was measurable when the pumps were turned on and shut off. The consistency of measured effects across all tests and the absence of discernable trends within and across tests indicate that the average effect of pumping across a broader period is equivalent to the average of all before and after comparisons, which was estimated as 9.9 L/s +/- 12.1 L/s, or 5.5% of river discharge at the time of the tests. Groundwater pumping did not result in a detectable shift in water temperature. The results indicate that changes in water temperature in relation to the pump tests were smaller in magnitude or spatial scale than the detection limits of the implemented experimental design. This case study provides an example of quantification of pumping effects on stream flow and temperature, as required by the Water Sustainability Act for licensing of groundwater abstraction. We suggest this approach could be used elsewhere to quantify effects of groundwater abstraction.Show less"

During this first survey, 15 different sized rivers varying in sediment grain size and geological substratum were sampled for both benthic (Surber sampler) and interstitial (Karaman-Chappuis pits) invertebrates during summer 1998-99. A total of 34 taxa was collected during the study, of which 22 were present in the sediment interstices. Interstitial assemblages were dominated by the Oligochaeta (present in 80% of the samples), the Chironomidae (in 73%), the Ceratopogonidae (in 73%), the Coleoptera Berosini (in 47%), the Turbellaria (in 47%), the OstracodaVestalenula sp. (in 40%) and the Copepoda Cyclopoida (in 40%). New amphipods close to Bogidiellidae were found in two stations. Some organisms, frequent and abundant in the benthic layer, were rare or absent in the sediment interstices (e.g. Decapoda Atyidae, Ephemeroptera Leptophlebiidae, Trichoptera Hydropsychidae and Leptoceridae, Diptera Simulidae). River size and distance between the station and the ocean were unassociated with abundance, taxonomic richness or composition of interstitial assemblages. In contrast, both abundance and taxonomic richness were significantly lower when sediment grain size decreased (probably because of low exchange with surface assemblages) and when the percentage of peridotitic substratum in the catchment increased (probably because of its high nickel and chromium contents). These preliminary results suggest that interstitial fauna can be used for ecological survey and river management even in tropical regions.Show less"
41,"Jackson, CR",Feb 3 2022 ,Distinctive Connectivities of Near-Stream and Watershed-Wide Land Uses Differentially Degrade Rural Aquatic Ecosystems,BIOSCIENCE,"The water-quality effects of low-density rural land-use activities are understudied but important because of large rural land coverage. We review and synthesize spatially extensive studies of oligotrophic mountain streams in the rural Southern Appalachian Mountains, concluding that rural land-use activities significantly degrade water quality through altered and mostly enhanced landscape-stream connections, despite high forest retention. Some connections (insolation, organic inputs, root-channel interactions, stream-field connectivity, individual landowner discharges) are controlled by near-stream land-use activities, whereas others (reduced nitrogen uptake and cycling, enhanced biological nitrogen fixation, nutrient subsidy, runoff from compacted soils, road runoff delivery) are controlled by basin-wide land use. These connections merge to alter basal resources and shift fish, salamander, and invertebrate assemblages toward species tolerant of higher turbidity and summer temperatures and those more competitive in mesotrophic systems. Rural water quality problems could be mitigated substantially with well-known best management practices, raising socioecological governance questions about best management practice adoption.Show less"
42,"Hou, Z",Sep 20 2017 ,Geochemical and Microbial Community Attributes in Relation to Hyporheic Zone Geological Facies,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is the active ecotone between the surface stream and groundwater, where exchanges of nutrients and organic carbon have been shown to stimulate microbial activity and transformations of carbon and nitrogen. To examine the relationship between sediment texture, biogeochemistry, and biological activity in the Columbia River HZ, the grain size distributions for sediment samples were characterized to define geological facies, and the relationships among physical properties of the facies, physicochemical attributes of the local environment, and the structure and activity of associated microbial communities were examined. Mud and sand content and the presence of microbial heterotrophic and nitrifying communities partially explained the variability in many biogeochemical attributes such as C:N ratio and % TOC. Microbial community analysis revealed a high relative abundance of putative ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospirae. Network analysis showed negative relationships between sets of co-varying organisms and sand and mud contents, and positive relationships with total organic carbon. Our results indicate grain size distribution is a good predictor of biogeochemical properties, and that subsets of the overall microbial community respond to different sediment texture. Relationships between facies and hydrobiogeochemical properties enable facies-based conditional simulation/mapping of these properties to inform multiscale modeling of hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical processes.Show less"
43,"Frei, S",Nov 2019 ,Quantification of Hyporheic Nitrate Removal at the Reach Scale: Exposure Times Versus Residence Times,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The rate of biogeochemical processing associated with natural degradation and transformation processes in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is one of the largest uncertainties in predicting nutrient fluxes. We present a lumped parameter model that can be used to quantify the mass loss for nitrate in the HZ operating at the scale of river reaches to the entire catchments. The model is based on using exposure times (ET) to account for the effective timescales of reactive transport in the HZ. Reach scale ET distributions are derived by removing the portion of hyporheic residence times (RT) associated with flow through the oxic zone. The model was used to quantify nitrate removal for two scenarios: (1) a 100 m generic river reach and (2) a small agricultural catchment in Brittany (France). For the field site, hyporheic RT were derived from measured in-stream 222Rn activities and mass balance modeling. Simulations were carried out using different types of RT distributions (exponential, power law, and gamma-type) for which ET were derived. Mass loss of nitrate in the HZ for the field site ranged from 0 to 0.45 kg day-1 depending on the RT distribution and the availability of oxygen in the streambed sediments. Simulations with power law ET distribution models only show very little removal of nitrate due to the heavy weighting toward shorter flow paths that are confined to the oxic sediments. Based on the simulation results, we suggest that using ET will likely lead to more realistic estimates for nutrient removal in river and stream networks.Show less"
44,"White, WR",Mar 2016 ,"Headwater Streams of Florida: Types, Distribution and a Framework for Conservation",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Using geographic information system and topographic maps, 5829 headwater streams in Florida were surveyed for several parameters including elevation, stream length, flow regime and surrounding geology, and vegetation. Each was assigned to one of four headwater types: wetland, seep, lake, and spring. Wetland headwaters were the most common and widespread followed by seeps, many displaying temporary flow, while springs were perennial and least numerous. Four groups of Florida rivers were identified through cluster analysis of drainage densities (number headwaters/km of river length). Group 1 consisted of six rivers with lowest drainage densities (0.30-1.39 streams/km main channel). All were coastal rivers of peninsular Florida and, with one exception, drain to the Gulf of Mexico. Seven of eight rivers (group 2) with intermediate drainage densities (1.77-3.04 streams/km main channel) were located in peninsular Florida. Only three of 12 rivers comprising the two groups (groups 3 and 4) with greatest drainage densities (5.16-9.37 and 15.49-16.96 streams/km main channel) were not located in the Florida panhandle. Stream conservation efforts should focus on both highly complex dendritic river networks of the panhandle and on the 7000km(2) area in central Florida mostly lacking headwaters that may become a significant dispersal bottleneck for aquatic biota seeking refugia farther north from projected climate change.

These structures may damage rivers by disrupting longitudinal connectivity, fragmenting rivers, and isolating populations. We tested whether a weir could impede the downstream dispersal of stream insects by comparing drift rates through natural pools and through a weir pool. For three of four of our study taxa (Offadens spp., Austrosimulium spp., and Simsonia spp.), we found the numbers of drifters were consistently reduced by the weir across multiple occasions (reduction ranging from 68 to 98%) to a higher degree than natural pools (reduction ranging from 24 to 41%). Drift of Cheumatopsyche spp. through the weir was greatly reduced in December (-95%) compared with natural pools, but the weir had little effect during April (-9%). There were size-related patterns in drift through the weir pool for some taxa. In the weir pool, emigrating individuals of Austrosimulium spp. were significantly smaller than immigrating individuals, which was not observed in natural pools. In contrast, significant reductions of Cheumatopsyche spp. drifters through the weir only occurred when individuals were small (December). Within the weir pool, the combined effects of lower average water velocity, multiple large low velocity areas, and the weir wall were likely to be the cause of the reduction in stream insect drift through the weir. The impediment of drift of some taxa by weirs may affect dispersal and colonisation processes. This obstruction of downstream movement could undermine the outcomes of river restoration projects.Show less"

Analysis of channel cross-sectional profiles and sedimentological data revealed a major change in morphology and sedimentology of the Deleg River during the past four decades: (i) the active river channel narrowed by over 45%, (ii) the riverbed incised on average by over 1.0 m and (iii) the median grain size of the bed surface decreased from 13.2 cm to 4.7 cm. The spatial pattern of land cover within the Deleg catchment also changed considerably: highly degraded agricultural land in the low-lying areas was abandoned and partially afforested for timber and wood production, whereas secondary upland forest was increasingly cleared for expansion of cropland and pastures. Notwithstanding large changes in the spatial organization of land use within the catchment, the overall land use did not change significantly during the past four decades. This suggests that the response of the Deleg River to land-use change not only depends on the overall land-use change, but also on the spatial pattern of land-use/cover change within the catchment. Although forestation and regeneration of bare gully slopes and floors throughout the catchment only represented a minor part of the total land-use change, these land-use/cover changes had a major impact on the hydrological and sediment connectivity in the landscape.

49,"Herzog, SP",Sep 18 2018 ,Performance of Engineered Streambeds for Inducing Hyporheic Transient Storage and Attenuation of Resazurin,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Several U.S. programs provide financial incentives for stream restoration to improve degraded water quality. These efforts prioritize hyporheic zone (HZ) restoration to enhance contaminant attenuation, but no stream restoration or stormwater best management practice (BMP) explicitly tailors hyporheic residence times to target specific contaminants of concern. Here we present the first physical demonstration of a new BMP called Biohydrochemical Enhancements for Streamwater Treatment (BEST). BEST are subsurface modules that use hydraulic conductivity modifications to drive hyporheic exchange and control residence times, combined with reactive geomedia to increase HZ reaction rates. Experiments were conducted in 15-m long outdoor flumes: one all-sand control, the other with BEST modules. Sodium chloride (conservative tracer) and resazurin (surrogate for a reactive pollutant) injections were conducted, with observations analyzed by stream transient storage models. Results demonstrated that BEST increased the effective HZ size and resazurin transformation both by similar to 50% compared to the control. Numerical simulations of extended reach lengths showed that BEST could achieve 1-log removal of resazurin in 111 m, versus 172 m in the control, and 414 m and 683 m in two numerically simulated urban streams. These results emphasize the potential of BEST as a novel HZ BMP to improve streamwater quality.Show less"
