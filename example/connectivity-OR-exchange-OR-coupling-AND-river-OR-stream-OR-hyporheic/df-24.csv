In this study, the hydrodynamics of river-floodplain connectivity under different flood conditions and the effect of the Nanchang Water Resources Project Group (NWRPG) in the middle branch of the Ganjang River were investigated using a combination of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and particle tracking. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated using data from several gauging stations and field measurements. Floods in the Ganjang River can be limited to the river itself (""River Flood"", flood with normal lake level) or further extended to the Poyang Lake (""Lake Flood"", flood with high lake level). The results show that compared with ""River Flood"" scenarios, ""Lake Flood"" scenarios increased the water level flooding a larger area. The flow velocity decreased and the residence time (RT) of particles increased. The particle travel distance (PTD) of ""River Flood"" was larger than that of ""Lake Flood"". The larger the flood, the greater the transboundary flux between the river and the floodplain, and the shorter the RT and PTD. The effect of NWRPG was the permanent flooding of part of the river floodplain, causing some habitat loss. Due to the increase in discharge, the implementation of the NWRPG results in a shorter RT with a smaller standard deviation, which has little effect on the PTD distribution. These findings can facilitate river connectivity restoration efforts in the Ganjang River and also provide a reference for assessing the impact of barrage projects.Show less"
1,"Burgess, OT",Jul 2013 ,"IMPORTANCE OF FLOODPLAIN CONNECTIVITY TO FISH POPULATIONS IN THE APALACHICOLA RIVER, FLORIDA",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Floodplain habitats provide critical spawning and rearing habitats for many large-river fishes. The paradigm that floodplains are essential habitats is often a key reason for restoring altered rivers to natural flow regimes. However, few studies have documented spatial and temporal utilization of floodplain habitats by adult fish of sport or commercial management interest or assessed obligatory access to floodplain habitats for species' persistence. In this study, we applied telemetry techniques to examine adult fish movements between floodplain and mainstem habitats, paired with intensive light trap sampling of larval fish in these same habitats, to assess the relationships between riverine flows and fish movement and spawning patterns in restored and unmodified floodplain distributaries of the Apalachicola River, Florida. Our intent is to inform resource managers on the relationships between the timing, magnitude and duration of flow events and fish spawning as part of river management actions. Our results demonstrate spawning by all study species in floodplain and mainstem river habitat types, apparent migratory movements of some species between these habitats, and distinct spawning events for each study species on the basis of fish movement patterns and light trap catches. Additionally, Micropterus spp., Lepomis spp. and, to a lesser degree, Minytrema melanops used floodplain channel habitat that was experimentally reconnected to the mainstem within a few weeks of completing the restoration. This result is of interest to managers assessing restoration activities to reconnect these habitats as part of riverine restoration programmes globally.

2,"Zhou, XD",Apr 1 2019 ,"Responses of macroinvertebrate assemblages to environmental variations in the river-oxbow lake system of the Zoige wetland (Bai River, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau)",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The biodiversity value of river-oxbow lake systems in high plateau peatland has been little recognized, and there are many gaps in our understanding of their ecology. In this study, we investigated the river-oxbow lake system of the Bai River basin, the main tributary of the Yellow River Source in the Zoige wetland from 2015 to 2016, in attempt to show how the environmental variations, especially hydrological connectivity and macrophyte biomass in the river-oxbow lake system influenced macroinvertebrates. Habitat patches were investigated in 11 river cross-sections and 18 oxbow lakes in the Bai River basin. Through hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling, four main types of habitats were identified in the river-oxbow lake system in the plateau: sand-bed river, cobble-bed river, sparse-macrophyte oxbow lake, and luxuriant-macrophyte oxbow lake. The luxuriant-macrophyte oxbows were characterized by high dissolved oxygen concentrations, alkalinity, and higher macroinvertebrate richness, density, biomass, and the Improved Shannon-Wiener Index in comparison to the other habitat types. Additionally, influential patterns of environmental variables on macroinvertebrates were analyzed using redundancy analysis. Lasso regression models were established to describe how macroinvertebrate density responded to macrophyte biomass and other variables, and how macrophyte biomass responded to hydrological connectivity and oxbow size. It was revealed that reduced hydrological connectivity and reduced oxbow size played important roles in increasing the biomass of submerged macrophyte, and dense macrophyte was directly responsible for the high biodiversity of macroinvertebrates. Different from the commonly believed unimodal influential pattern that medium hydrological connectivity supports the highest biodiversity in oxbow lakes reported in previous studies, macroinvertebrates in the high plateau river-oxbow lake systems benefited from low connectivity and reduced size. Oxbow lakes, especially those covered with luxuriant macrophytes, diversified the macroinvertebrate assemblages and enhanced primary consumer biomass at the regional scale. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

3,"Yahorava, V",Feb 2014 ,Ion exchange technology for the efficient recovery of precious metals from waste and low-grade streams,JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY,"Efficient recovery of precious metals from process solutions is essential for improving process economics. Traditionally, precious metals are relatively effectively recovered from waste streams via precipitation or cementation. However, these approaches have a number of drawbacks, including poor water balance, creation of environmentally unfriendly waste streams, and losses of precious metals. Ion exchange technology is an alternative for the recovery of precious metals from waste or low-grade streams. This technology allows the recovery of the precious metals to extremely low levels (micrograms per litre) with relatively high upgrade ratios from the solution onto the resin without major water balance concerns, while the impact on the environment could be minimized or avoided.Research was conducted on the recovery of platinum group metals and gold from different low-grade and waste streams from one of the precious metals refineries in South Africa by means of ion exchange. Various functionallties and matrices (granular and fibrous) of ion exchange materials were evaluated. The results from these studies indicated that in some cases ion exchange could be very effective for the recovery of precious metals, and that the PGM concentration could be reduced to < 1 mg/L. The upgrading ratios of the various PGMs onto the specific fibres were relatively high for the specific streams evaluated, which might in some cases justify incineration of the loaded material instead of stripping and recycling the adsorbent. The cost of direct incineration for one of the waste streams tested would be less than 1% of the value of the PGMs recovered. However, the adsorbent has to be carefully selected and the process design optimized for each specific stream.Show less"

7,"Harvey, JW",Apr 1998 ,Effect of enhanced manganese oxidation in the hyporheic zone on basin-scale geochemical mass balance,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We determined the role of the hyporheic zone (the subsurface zone where stream water and shallow groundwater mix) in enhancing microbially mediated oxidation of dissolved manganese (to form manganese precipitates) in a drainage basin contaminated by copper mining. The fate of manganese is of overall importance to water quality in Final Creek Basin, Arizona, because manganese reactions affect the transport of trace metals. The basiri-scale role of the hyporheic zone is difficult to quantify because stream-tracer; studies do not always reliably characterize the cumulative effects of the hyporheic zone. This study determined cumulative effects of hyporheic reactions in Final Creek basin by characterizing manganese uptake at several spatial scales (stream-reach scale, hyporheic-flow-path scale, and sediment-grain scale). At the stream-reach scale a one-dimensional stream-transport model (including storage zones to represent hyporheic flow paths) was used to determine a reach-averaged time constant for manganese uptake in hyporheic zones, 1/lambda(s), 1.3 hours, which was somewhat faster but still similar to manganese uptake time constants that were measured directly in centimeter-scale hyporheic flow paths (1/lambda(h) = 2.6 hours), and in laboratory batch experiments using streambed sediment (1/lambda = 2.7 hours). The modeled depths of subsurface storage zones (d(s) = 4-17 cm) and modeled residence times of water in storage zones (t(s) = 3-12 min) were both consistent with direct measurements in hyporheic flow paths (d(h) = 0-15 cm, and t(h) = 1-25 min). There was also good agreement between reach-scale modeling and direct measurements of the percentage removal of dissolved manganese in hyporheic flow paths (f(s) = 8.9%, and f(h) = 9.3%). Manganese uptake experiments in the laboratory using sediment from Final Creek demonstrated (through comparison of poisoned and unpoisoned treatments) that the manganese removal process was enhanced by microbially mediated oxidation. The cumulative effect of hyporheic exchange in Final Creek basin was to remove approximately 20% of the dissolved manganese flowing out of the drainage basin. Our results illustrate that the cumulative significance of reactive uptake in the hyporheic zone depends on the balance between chemical reaction rates, hyporheic porewater residence time, and turnover of streamflow through hyporheic flow paths. The similarity between the hyporheic reaction timescale (1/lambda(s) approximate to 1.3 hours), and the hyporheic porewater residence timescale (t(s) approximate to 8 min) ensured that there was adequate time for the reaction to progress. Furthermore, it was the similarity between the turnover length for stream water flow through hyporheic how paths (L-s = stream velocity/storage-zone exchange coefficient approximate to 1.3 km) and the length of Final Creek (L approximate to 7 km), which ensured that all stream water passed through hyporheic flow paths several times.As a means to generalize our findings to other sites where similar types of hydrologic and chemical information are available, we suggest a cumulative significance index for hyporheic reactions, R-s = lambda(s)t(s)L/L-s (dimensionless); higher values indicate a greater potential for hyporheic reactions to influence geochemical mass balance. Our experience in Final Creek basin suggests that values of R-s > 0.2 characterize systems where hyporheic reactions are likely to influence geochemical mass balance at the drainage-basin scale.Show less"
8,"Thanh, LD",Jun 2020 ,A Physically Based Model for the Streaming Potential Coupling Coefficient in Partially Saturated Porous Media,WATER,"The electrokinetics methods have great potential to characterize hydrogeological processes in porous media, especially in complex partially saturated hydrosystems (e.g., the vadose zone). The dependence of the streaming coupling coefficient on water saturation remains highly debated in both theoretical and experimental works. In this work, we propose a physically based model for the streaming potential coupling coefficient in porous media during the flow of water and air under partially saturated conditions. The proposed model is linked to fluid electrical conductivity, water saturation, irreducible water saturation, and microstructural parameters of porous materials. In particular, the surface conductivity of porous media has been taken into account in the model. In addition, we also obtain an expression for the characteristic length scale at full saturation in this work. The proposed model is successfully validated using experimental data from literature. A relationship between the streaming potential coupling coefficient and the effective excess charge density is also obtained in this work and the result is the same as those proposed in literature using different approaches. The model proposes a simple and efficient way to model the streaming potential generation for partially saturated porous media and can be useful for hydrogeophysical studies in the critical zone.Show less"
9,"Cardenas, MB",May 2015 ,Hyporheic zone hydrologic science: A historical account of its emergence and a prospectus,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone, defined by shallow subsurface pathways through river beds and banks beginning and ending at the river, is an integral and unique component of fluvial systems. It hosts myriad hydrologically controlled processes that are potentially coupled in complex ways. Understanding these processes and the connections between them is critical since these processes are not only important locally but integrate to impact increasingly larger scale biogeochemical functioning of the river corridor up to the river network scale. Thus, the hyporheic zone continues to be a growing research focus for many hydrologists for more than half the history of Water Resources Research. This manuscript partly summarizes the historical development of hyporheic zone hydrologic science as gleaned from papers published in Water Resources Research, from the birth of the concept of the hyporheic zone as a hydrologic black box ( sometimes referred to as transient storage zone), to its adolescent years of being torn between occasionally competing research perspectives of interrogating the hyporheic zone from a surface or subsurface view, to its mature emergence as an interdisciplinary research field that employs the wide array of state-of-the-art tools available to the modern hydrologist. The field is vibrant and moving in the right direction of addressing critical fundamental and applied questions with no clear end in sight in its growth. There are exciting opportunities for scientists that are able to tightly link the allied fields of geology, geomorphology, hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology to tackle the many open problems in hyporheic zone science.Show less"

11,"Schild, R",Nov 15 2001 ,Coupling of biomass production and sedimentation of suspended sediments in eutrophic rivers,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"In eutrophic rivers, not only the hydraulic processes (e.g. turbulent flow, deposition, resuspension) but also the biological ones (e.g. primary production, metabolic losses, grazing, decomposition and agglomeration) show a great influence on the dynamics of the total suspended sediments. On the other hand, because of the light limitation, the primary production itself is strongly dependent on the actual suspended matter concentration. In the present paper, model approaches to the biological and hydraulic coupling are assessed and discussed in comparison with measuring data. The coupling approaches have been developed and fixed in the model system PAMIR-C, which combines both the hydrobiological and the hydraulic effects by means of coupled algebraic and differential equations. We used PAMIR-C to simulate the concentration development over 3 years in a well-examined compartment of the Spree River near Berlin, Germany. The simulation runs show, that the primary production as well as the hydraulic regime have a great influence on the mean particle properties, and thereby on the mean settling velocity of the suspended particles. Moreover, they both regulate the existence and availability of resuspendible sediments in the river bed. So, via the deposition and resuspension of sediments, both the hydraulic and hydrobiological effects proved to be highly relevant for the concentration development in eutrophic rivers.

12,"Xiao, R",Oct 2020 ,Plankton distribution patterns and the relationship with environmental gradients and hydrological connectivity of wetlands in the Yellow River Delta,ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY,"In order to discover the plankton distribution patterns and its relationship with environment gradients and hydrological connectivity in wetlands, samples from Yellow River Delta that span gradients in salinity and hydrological connectivity were analyzed in this study. Plankton community composition, abundance and biomass were determined and correlated with water variables and hydrological connectivity indexes to gain information about the forces that structure the plankton community in this dynamic environment. Phytoplankton with a total of 88 species and zooplankton with a total of 49 species were observed at an average abundance of 4.11 x 10(7) cells/L and 951.27 ind./L, respectively. Predominant species were Merismopedia minima G.Beck/Merismopedia elegans A. Braun ex Razing (Cyanobacteria) and Trichocerca pusilla (Jennings) (Rotifera), accounting for over 10% of the total abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton, respectively. The dominant species of phytoplankton communities were shifted from freshwater Chlorophyta (e.g., Oocystis sp.) to brackish Cyanobacteria (e.g., Merismopedia minima and Merismopedia eleguns) and then to marine cyanobacterium (e.g., Oscillatoria sp. and Pseudoanabaena sp.); That shift in zooplankton community was from freshwater rotifers Trichocerca pusilla and Polyarthra trigla (Ehrenberg) to brackish rotifer Brachionus urceus (Linnaeus) and copepod Thermocyclops spp. and then to marine copepods Sinocalanus spp. and Microsetella spp. toward the river mouth. However, abundance, biomass and community similarity of plankton decreased with increasing water salinity and decreasing hydrological connectivity from upper reaches to river mouth. Salinity gradient could be major force for the shift of plankton community while the increasing hydrological connectivity between freshwater and saline habitats promoted the similarity of plankton distribution patterns within the wetland network.

13,"Ikard, SJ",Jun 2018 ,New Insights on Scale-dependent Surface-Groundwater Exchange from a Floating Self-potential Dipole,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING GEOPHYSICS,"In south-central Texas the lower Guadalupe River has incised into the outcrop of the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer. The river and the aquifer are hydraulically connected across the outcrop, although the connectivity is obscured at the surface by alluvium and surface-water and groundwater exchange dynamics are currently poorly understood. To investigate surface-water and groundwater exchange dynamics between the lower Guadalupe River and the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer, a geophysical study was completed along a 14.86 km reach of the river by using water-borne gradient self-potential (SP) profiling and two-dimensional direct-current electric resistivity tomography. This paper explores the applicability of these water-borne geoelectric methods in delineating gaining and losing channel reaches, and demonstrates that geoelectric signals in the form of total electric field strength can be logged with an electric dipole and decomposed into component SP signals depicting regional and local groundwater flow patterns attributable to regional and localized hydraulic gradients. Localized SP anomalies of several tens of millivolts, indicative of hyporheic exchange flows, are observed and superimposed upon a 124 mV regional SP anomaly indicative of ambient groundwater exchange flows between the river and the aquifer. The observed SP signals are interpreted through two-dimensional finite-element modeling of streaming potentials attributable to ambient groundwater exchange and hyporheic exchange flow patterns. Variables of the channel environment such as temperature and concentration gradients, depth, and velocity are considered and subsequently eliminated as alternative sources of the SP signals that are presented.Show less"
14,"Choy, M",2018 ,Measuring 30 years of improvements to aquatic connectivity in the Greater Toronto Area,AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT,"Instream barriers (e.g. dams, weirs and road crossings) fragment aquatic habitat and prevent the upstream movement of fish, impairing the ability of fishes to complete critical life stages, access critical habitat and for dispersal among local populations. Mitigation efforts have improved aquatic connectivity to some degree, but it has been challenging to quantify the overall improvement in connectivity without long-term and costly field assessments. The development of spatially explicit habitat connectivity indices make it possible to evaluate current stream connectivity, and quantify the improvement prior mitigation projects have had on connectivity. We combined a list of instream barrier mitigation projects completed in five watersheds in the Toronto (Ontario, Canada) area from 1987-2016 (mitigated barriers) and a previously established inventory of all known instream barriers in 2016 (current barriers). The cumulative improvement to connectivity was measured for potadromous (remain in tributaries) and diadromous (move between tributaries and lake) fish species using the dendritic connectivity index. Aquatic connectivity improved for diadromous species between 0 and 14.5% and for potadromous species between 0.1 and 4.4% in the five studied watersheds. Some variation in improvement among the watersheds can likely be attributed to differences in mitigation strategies among the watersheds and a historical emphasis on mitigating instream barriers to benefit migratory salmonid species.Show less"
15,"Qin, J",Oct 2017 ,Sediment exchange between groin fields and main-stream,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Sediment exchange between groin fields and the main-stream influences the transport and distribution of polluted sediment that represents a hazard for rivers and neighboring floodplains. Despite its practical significance, little research has been done on the sediment exchange process itself, and existing studies used to estimate the sediment exchange by morphological change. The sediment exchange process, however, differs from morphological variation and includes two behaviors: the entrance of main-stream sediment into groin fields and the movement of groin field sediment out of groin fields. Therefore, this study aims at examining this exchange process and exploring the mechanisms of different exchange phenomena. Experiments were conducted in a mobile-bed laboratory flume by using a novel experimental method that successfully separates the movement of groin fields sediment from that of main-stream sediment. In addition to traditional measurements, such as measurements of morphological changes, surface flow velocities, and bed-form propagation, the deposition of main-stream sediment in groin fields is measured in detail. The results demonstrate that morphological change cannot reflect the sediment exchange process. The deposition of main-stream sediment in groin fields is determined by the dynamics of sediment movement, in which bedload-and suspended-sediment-dominated processes exhibit different deposition patterns. The movement of groin field sediment out of groin fields is determined mainly by local scouring around groins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
16,"Malcolm, IA",Feb 2009 ,Fine scale variability of hyporheic hydrochemistry in salmon spawning gravels with contrasting groundwater-surface water interactions,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"There is increasing realisation of the importance of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions in understanding freshwater ecology. A study that assessed the influence of local GW-SW interactions on shallow (< 250mm) hyporheic water quality at two contrasting salmon spawning locations in Scotland, UK is reported. At a groundwater-dominated site, continuous logging sensors revealed that hyporheic dissolved oxygen ( DO) concentrations changed rapidly in response to changing hydrological conditions. Low volume (25ml) spot samples revealed fine-scale spatial variability (< 0.05m) consistent with a vertically shifting boundary layer between source waters. At a surface-water-dominated location, hyporheic water was typically characterised by high DO and electrical conductivity values, characteristic of surface water. Small reductions in DO at this site are hypothesised to be associated with short residence hyporheic discharge. A comparison between in-situ ( logging DO sensor data) and ex-situ ( small volume sampling) methods revealed good agreement, potentially allowing deployment of the two methods in stratified sampling programmes. This study demonstrates that hyporheic water quality varies over fine spatial and temporal scales and that future studies need to design sampling strategies that consider the scales appropriate to both the ecology and the hyporheic processes of interest.Show less"

18,"Chu, NY",Oct 14 2022 ,Hydrodynamical transport structure and lagrangian connectivity of circulations in the Pearl River Estuary,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"Using a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model, this study explored the seasonal hydrodynamic transport structure in the Pearl River Estuary and illustrated the intrinsic connectivity under multiscale motions from a Lagrangian perspective. Generally, the surface Lagrangian residual current (U-L) is uniformly southwestward/southeastward in summer/winter, with a stronger intensity in the lower estuary. The bottom U-L features in the southeastward direction in the upper estuary and northwest direction in the lower estuary. The fluvial-tide interaction line advances southeastward and northwestward in summer and winter, respectively. The U-L captured the major transport processes and was in good agreement with the mean surface sediment transport patterns. In the transition region between Lantau Island and Neilingding Island, where it is largely affected by the interaction between the periodic tidal current and river discharge, the spatially averaged U-L showed intensified intratidal variations and had a larger difference with the locally temporally averaged Eulerian residual current. The remarkable Lagrangian coherent structures that illustrated the transport paths and transport convergence regions were identified, which are generally consistent with the bottom sediment depocenters. Based on the Lagrangian connectivity analysis, it was revealed that a barrier between the western and eastern estuaries existed, which was weakened by the strong river discharge during summer. Two convergence regions near the Macau and Hong Kong waters were identified, where the sediment and pollutants easily settled. The study demonstrated the importance of the Lagrangian view in understanding the hydrodynamic process and transport structure in the estuary-shelf regions.Show less"
19,"Vasilevskiy, P",Apr 2022 ,Simulating River/Lake-Groundwater Exchanges in Arid River Basins: An Improvement Constrained by Lake Surface Area Dynamics and Evapotranspiration,REMOTE SENSING,"Surface water-groundwater interactions in arid zones are characterized by water exchange processes in a complex system comprising intermittent streams/terminal lakes, shallow aquifers, riparian zone evapotranspiration, and groundwater withdrawal. Notable challenges arise when simulating such hydrological systems; for example, field observations are scarce, and hydrogeological parameters exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity. To reduce the simulation uncertainties, in addition to groundwater head and river discharge measurements, we adopted remote sensing-based evapotranspiration data and lake area dynamics as known conditions to calibrate the model. We chose the Ejina Basin, located in the lower reaches of the Heihe River Basin in arid northwest China, as the study area to validate our modelling approach. The hydrological system of this basin is characterized by intensive, spatiotemporally variable surface water-groundwater interactions. The areas of the terminal lakes into which all river runoff flows vary significantly depending on the ratio between river runoff and lake evaporation. Simulation results with a monthly time step from 2000 to 2017 indicate that river leakage accounted for approximately 61% of the total river runoff. Our study shows that for areas where surface water and groundwater observations are sparse, combining remote sensing product data of surface water areas and evapotranspiration can effectively reduce the uncertainty in coupled surface water and groundwater simulations.Show less"
20,"Bouska, KL",Jun 2019 ,Applying concepts of general resilience to large river ecosystems: A case study from the Upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Large floodplain-river ecosystems are often highly modified to provide services that society desires, yet these modifications can limit an ecosystem's ability to adapt to changing conditions. The adaptive capacity of an ecosystem, its general resilience, is a conceptual framework for considering how a system will respond to such changes. We sought to apply aspects of three general resilience principles (diversity and redundancy, connectivity, and controlling variables) to our understanding of floodplain-river ecosystem structure and function. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a case study of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). In doing so, we developed ten indicators that highlight important structural and functional aspects of this floodplain-river ecosystem, and likely underlie the capacity of large rivers to cope with environmental change and disturbance. We developed diversity and redundancy indicators for aquatic habitats, patterns of floodplain inundation, and fish communities. Connectivity indicators included metrics of longitudinal and lateral connections. Controlling variable indicators included deviations from historic water surface elevation fluctuations, water clarity, nutrient concentrations, and aquatic invasive species. This set of indicators provides a simple description of the adaptive capacity of four distinct reaches of the UMRS: Upper Impounded, Lower Impounded, Unimpounded Reaches of the Upper Mississippi River and the entire Illinois River. High aquatic habitat diversity and redundancy, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and water clarity, and the scarcity of invasive fish species are all factors that likely contribute to the high general resilience of the Upper Impounded Reach. However, the limited longitudinal connectivity and establishment of a minimum water level for navigation are factors that may inhibit the general resilience of this reach. In the Lower Impounded Reach, there is high within-reach variability for individual indicators such as aquatic habitat diversity, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and longitudinal and lateral connectivity. In the Unimpounded Reach, a high degree of longitudinal connectivity likely enhances its general resilience, but low aquatic habitat diversity, low lateral connectivity, and relatively high number of invasive fish species inhibit general resilience. For the Illinois River Reach, the relatively high fish functional diversity and redundancy likely contributes to its general resilience, whereas high number of invasive fish species, low water clarity, low lateral connectivity, and high range of water levels may inhibit general resilience. Indicators derived from application of concepts of general resilience provide insight into the current coping capacity of the UMRS and identify opportunities for enhancing resilience.Show less"
21,"Bednarik, A",Aug 2015 ,Contribution of Methane Benthic and Atmospheric Fluxes of an Experimental Area (Sitka Stream),CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER,"Contributions of methane benthic fluxes and methane emissions to the total methane amount were studied during the summer season for two consecutive years. Considering the fact that methane is produced in great amount within hyporheic sediments, we have expected that both methane released by the benthic fluxes into the overlying water and methane emitted to the atmosphere should significantly affect the total methane budget of the stream water within the experimental area. In order to asses this assumption, we measured methane concentrations within the vertical sediment profile of a hyporheic zone, direct benthic methane fluxes by static chambers, methane concentrations in the surface water, and methane emissions into the atmosphere simultaneously. The methane concentrations in interstitial water tended sharply to increase with sediment depth (0.54-734.99 mu mol L-1) and were strongly correlated with benthic fluxes (r = 0.88, p<0.05). We also found a considerable variability in the benthic methane fluxes (0-12.59 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and the spatial variability (0-71.43%) of the experimental area, suggesting that there may be various factors that affect the rate of benthic fluxes including methanotrophy in the top sediment layers. Generally, the contribution of benthic fluxes and methane emissions to the methane budgets of the experimental area was negligible (0.034 (0.45%) and 0.074 mol day(-1) (0.98%), respectively).Show less"

Usually, models include physically-based, deterministic formulations to calculate water temperatures from detailed meteorological information, which usually comes from meteorological stations located far from the river reaches. However, alternative empirical approaches have been proposed, that usually depend oil air temperature as master variable. This Study explored the performance of a semidistributed water quality application modelling river water temperature in a Mediterranean watershed, using three different approaches. First, a deterministic approach was used accounting for the different heat exchange components usually considered in water temperature models. Second, an empirical approximation was applied using the equilibrium temperature concept, assuming a linear relationship with air temperature. And third, a hybrid approach was constructed, in which the temperature equilibrium concept and the deterministic approach were combined. Results showed that the hybrid approach gave the best results, followed by the empirical approximation. The deterministic formulation gave the worst results. The hybrid approach not only fitted daily river water temperatures, but also adequately modelled the daily temperature range (maximum-minimum daily temperature). Other river water features directly dependent oil water temperature, such as river intrusion depth in lentic systems (i.e. the depth at which the river inflow plunges to equilibrate density differences with lake water), were also correctly modelled even at hourly time steps. However, results for the different heat fluxes between river and atmosphere were very unrealistic. Although direct evidence of discrepancies between meteorological drivers measured at the meteorological stations and the actual river microclimate was not found, the use of models including empirical or hybrid formulations depending mainly oil air temperature is recommended if only meteorological data from locations far from the river reaches are available.

24,"Zarate, A",Oct 1 2020 ,"Connectivity of bacterial assemblages along the Loa River in the Atacama Desert, Chile",PEERJ,"The Loa River is the only perennial artery that crosses the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It plays an important role in the ecological and economic development of the most water-stressed region, revealing the impact of the mining industry, which exacerbate regional water shortages for many organisms and ecological processes. Despite this, the river system has remained understudied. To our knowledge, this study provides the first effort to attempt to compare the microbial communities at spatial scale along the Loa River, as well as investigate the physicochemical factors that could modulate this important biological component that still remains largely unexplored. The analysis of the spatial bacterial distribution and their interconnections in the water column and sediment samples from eight sites located in three sections along the river catchment (upper, middle and lower) was conducted using 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Among a total of 543 ASVs identified at the family level, over 40.5% were cosmopolitan in the river and distributed within a preference pattern by the sediment substrate with 162 unique ASVs, while only 87 were specific to the column water. Bacterial diversity gradually decreased from the headwaters, where the upper section had the largest number of unique families. Distinct groupings of bacterial communities often associated with anthropogenic disturbance, including Burkholderiaceae and Flavobacteriaceae families were predominant in the less-impacted upstream section. Members of the Arcobacteraceae and Marinomonadaceae were prominent in the agriculturally and mining-impacted middle sector while Rhodobacteraceae and Coxiellaceae were most abundant families in downstream sites. Such shifts in the community structure were also related to the influence of salinity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and redox potential. Network analyses corroborated the strong connectivity and modular structure of bacterial communities across this desert river, shedding light on taxonomic relatedness of co-occurring species and highlighting the need for planning the integral conservation of this basin.Show less"
25,"Bieger, K",Jun 2019 ,Representing the Connectivity of Upland Areas to Floodplains and Streams in SWAT,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"In recent years, watershed modelers have put increasing emphasis on capturing the interaction of landscape hydrologic processes instead of focusing on streamflow at the watershed outlet alone. Understanding the hydrologic connectivity between landscape elements is important to explain the hydrologic response of a watershed to rainfall events. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool+ (SWAT+) is a new version of SWAT with improved runoff routing capabilities. Subbasins may be divided into landscape units (LSUs), e.g., upland areas and floodplains, and flow can be routed between these LSUs. We ran three scenarios representing different extents of connectivity between uplands, floodplains, and streams. In the first and second scenarios, the ratio of channelized flow from the upland to the stream and sheet flow from the upland to the floodplain was 70/30 and 30/70, respectively, for all upland/floodplain pairs. In the third scenario, the ratio was calculated for each upland/floodplain pair based on the upland/floodplain area ratio. Results indicate differences in streamflow were small, but the relative importance of flow components and upland areas and floodplains as sources of surface runoff changed. Also, the soil moisture in the floodplains was impacted. The third scenario was found to provide more realistic results than the other two. A realistic representation of connectivity in watershed models has important implications for the identification of pollution sources and sinks.Show less"
26,"Alam, MK",Nov 2020 ,Stable isotope ratios of emergent adult aquatic insects can be used as indicators of water pollution in the hyporheic food web,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Bio-assessment protocols for the subsurface domain of river channels (i.e. hyporheic zone) are scarce despite of the known importance of its ecological function in river ecosystems. The larvae of the Alloperla ishikariana Plecoptera species inhabit the hyporheic zone. Therefore, we examined whether emergent adult A. ishikariana could serve as proxy indicators of the effects of pollution in the hyporheic food web. The study site comprised a 15-km stretch of a gravel bed river in Hokkaido, Japan, from which all invertebrates were collected from the riverbed at a depth of 30-50 cm, and emergent A. ishikariana adults were sampled in riparian zones. Water quality changed gradually along the river owing to the effects of a wastewater treatment plant and surrounding land uses. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios (SIRs) of epilithic biofilms, hyporheic particulate organic matter (POM), benthic POM, and invertebrates were used to determine the major basal carbon sources, the effects of water pollution on the hyporheic zone, and the trophic positions of dominant invertebrates. Generalized linear (mixed) models were used for statistical testing and modeling. Amphipoda and the larvae of A. ishikariana were considered as top predators and secondary consumers in the hyporheic food web, respectively. The observed similarity in water quality between the hyporheic and surface water suggested a large degree of hydrological exchange between the two zones, and resulted in positive increases in the nitrogen SIRs of hyporheic invertebrates, including A. ishikariana larvae, in proportion to nitrate levels in the surface water. The nitrogen SIRs of A. ishikariana adults were significantly correlated with the nitrogen SIRs of their larvae within the same location (adjusted R-2 = 0.78), indicating that emerged adults can provide information on the longitudinal variability of the effects of synthetic nitrogen. In contrast, the carbon SIRs of adults did not predict those of their larvae, possibly reflecting the diverse feeding habitats of larvae. Overall, we demonstrated that adult aquatic insects emerging from the hyporheic zone can be used as indirect indicators of pollution-associated nutrient assimilation as well as the spatial heterogeneity of dietary carbon resources in hyporheic food web.Show less"
27,"Arboleya, E",Jun 22 2021 ,River Connectivity is Crucial for Safeguarding Biodiversity but May be Socially Overlooked. Insights From Spanish University Students,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"The social value of natural aquatic ecosystems is very important to set management priorities. River connectivity is essential for the conservation of freshwater ecosystems because barriers alter both abiotic conditions and the biotic communities, compromising biodiversity; however, the appreciation of this river feature has been insufficiently considered in socio-environmental studies that are mainly focused on the acceptance of new dams. Here we used a willingness to pay approach to estimate the value of connectivity, native species, fish diversity (measured as functional diversity or as species richness), fish abundance and environmental quality in three groups of students of different educational background in Asturias (NW of Spain). As in other studies where they are more sensitive to environmental issues, educational sciences students would pay more to conserve and improve river conditions than students of other disciplines. Connectivity was the least valued river feature by students of educational and natural sciences, and the third (before biodiversity and fish abundance) by engineering students. We measured the same features on lowland reaches of four coastal rivers in the Bay of Biscay, and applied declared will amounts to model their appreciation. Differences between the river ranks obtained from functional diversity (that changes with non-native species) and species richness, and small differences between students of different disciplines in the gap between most and least preferred rivers arise from the model. This indicates the importance to involve diverse stakeholder sectors in decisions about rivers. The importance of river connectivity in the conservation of local biodiversity should be explained to general public, perhaps through environmental campaigns.Show less"
28,"Chen, WB",May 1 2013 ,Coupling of a one-dimensional river routing model and a three-dimensional ocean model to predict overbank flows in a complex river-ocean system,APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING,"River-ocean coupled models were developed to calculate overbank flows in a complex river-coastal ocean system comprising the Wu River and the adjacent coastal ocean of central Taiwan. The hydrodynamic quantities were exchanged between one-dimensional and three-dimensional domains during runtime to resolve the real-time exchange and interaction between the coastal waters and the river system. The coupled model was calibrated and verified with the observed water levels using data from three typhoon events. The results indicate a reasonable agreement between the model simulations and the observed data. The model was then used to calculate hydrographs of the overbank flow caused by Typhoon Kalmaegi, which occurred in 2008. The simulated overbank flows quantitatively agreed with the reported information. We also demonstrated that most of the overbank flows occurred at the upper reaches of the tributaries of the Wu River system, except for the tributary in the Fazi River. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

29,"Wildhaber, YS",Feb 1 2014 ,"Effects of river morphology, hydraulic gradients, and sediment deposition on water exchange and oxygen dynamics in salmonid redds",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Fine sediment decreasing gravel permeability and oxygen supply to incubating salmonid embryos, is often considered the main contributing factor for the observed decline of salmonid populations. However, oxygen supply to salmonid embryos also depends on hydraulic conditions driving water flow through the redd. A more generalized perspective is needed to better understand the constraints on successful salmonid incubation in the many heavily modified fluvial ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere. The effects of hydraulic gradients, riverbed and redd morphology as well as fine sediment deposition on dissolved oxygen (DO) and water exchange was studied in 18 artificial redds at three sites along a modified river. Fifty percent of the redds in the two downstream sites were lost during high flow events, while redd loss at the upstream site was substantially lower (8%). This pattern was likely related to increasing flood heights from up- to downstream. Specific water infiltration rates (q) and DO were highly dynamic and driven on multiple temporal and spatial scales. Temporally, the high permeability of the redd gravel and the typical pit-tail structure of the new built redds, leading to high DO, disappeared within a month, when fine sediment had infiltrated and the redd structure was leveled. On the scale of hours to days, DO concentrations and q increased during high flows, but decreased during the falling limb of the water level, most likely related to exfiltration of oxygen depleted groundwater or hyporheic water. DO concentrations also decreased under prolonged base flow conditions, when increased infiltration of silt and clay particles clogged the riverbed and reduced q. Spatially, artificial log steps affected fine sediment infiltration, q and interstitial DO in the redds. The results demonstrate that multiple factors have to be considered for successful river management in salmonid streams, including riverbed structure and local and regional hydrogeological conditions.

30,"Rolls, ET",Aug 22 2022 ,The effective connectivity of the human hippocampal memory system,CEREBRAL CORTEX,"Effective connectivity measurements in the human hippocampal memory system based on the resting-state blood oxygenation-level dependent signal were made in 172 participants in the Human Connectome Project to reveal the directionality and strength of the connectivity. A ventral ""what"" hippocampal stream involves the temporal lobe cortex, perirhinal and parahippocampal TF cortex, and entorhinal cortex. A dorsal ""where"" hippocampal stream connects parietal cortex with posterior and retrosplenial cingulate cortex, and with parahippocampal TH cortex, which, in turn, project to the presubiculum, which connects to the hippocampus. A third stream involves the orbitofrontal and ventromedial-prefrontal cortex with effective connectivity with the hippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortex. There is generally stronger forward connectivity to the hippocampus than backward. Thus separate ""what,"" ""where,"" and ""reward"" streams can converge in the hippocampus, from which back projections return to the sources. However, unlike the simple dual stream hippocampal model, there is a third stream related to reward value; there is some cross-connectivity between these systems before the hippocampus is reached; and the hippocampus has some effective connectivity with earlier stages of processing than the entorhinal cortex and presubiculum. These findings complement diffusion tractography and provide a foundation for new concepts on the operation of the human hippocampal memory system.Show less"
31,"Dare, GC",Aug 2020 ,Run-of-river dams as a barrier to the movement of a stream-dwelling amphibian,ECOSPHERE,"Human activities frequently create structures that alter the connectivity among habitats or act as barriers to the natural movement of animals. Movement allows individuals to access different habitats, connect life history stages, and maintain genetic diversity. Here, we evaluated whether run-of-river (RoR) hydropower projects, an emerging renewable energy source in British Columbia, interrupt the longitudinal connectivity among larval stream amphibians, by altering larval rearing densities, with possible repercussions on growth and survival. In three watersheds, we tested for differences in the average upstream and downstream density of larval coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), as well as changes to their longitudinal distribution upstream of the dams, as would be expected if RoR dams or their headponds act as barriers to the natural downstream drift of larvae. We found a 60% decrease in larval densities downstream compared to upstream of dams, consistent with RoR dams interrupting the natural pattern of downstreamA. trueidrift. Larval densities in the first 10 m above RoR headponds were 3 times higher compared to 100 m upstream, and when expressed in terms of relative abundance, we find a similar pattern, with between 2.5 and 3 times more larvae in the first 10 m above of the headpond than expected if larvae followed a uniform distribution. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that RoR dams alter the spatial connectivity ofA. trueilarvae, leading to an accumulation of larvae directly above the dam, with unknown consequences for larval growth and survival. Our findings suggest caution is warranted when interpreting before-after monitoring studies that are often used to evaluate the impact of dams, whereby we find that reductions in downstream densities could be due to interruptions of downstream movement as opposed to direct mortality.Show less"
32,"Zarnetske, JP",Nov 7 2012 ,Coupled transport and reaction kinetics control the nitrate source-sink function of hyporheic zones,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The fate of biologically available nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in stream ecosystems is controlled by the coupling of physical transport and biogeochemical reaction kinetics. However, determining the relative role of physical and biogeochemical controls at different temporal and spatial scales is difficult. The hyporheic zone (HZ), where groundwater-stream water mix, can be an important location controlling N and C transformations because it creates strong gradients in both the physical and biogeochemical conditions that control redox biogeochemistry. We evaluated the coupling of physical transport and biogeochemical redox reactions by linking an advection, dispersion, and residence time model with a multiple Monod kinetics model simulating the concentrations of oxygen (O-2), ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We used global Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses with a nondimensional form of the model to examine coupled nitrification-denitrification dynamics across many scales of transport and reaction conditions. Results demonstrated that the residence time of water in the HZ and the uptake rate of O-2 from either respiration and/or nitrification determined whether the HZ was a source or a sink of NO3 to the stream. We further show that whether the HZ is a net NO3 source or net NO3 sink is determined by the ratio of the characteristic transport time to the characteristic reaction time of O-2 (i.e., the Damkohler number, Da(O2)), where HZs with Da(O2) < 1 will be net nitrification environments and HZs with Da(O2) << 1 will be net denitrification environments. Our coupling of the hydrologic and biogeochemical limitations of N transformations across different temporal and spatial scales within the HZ allows us to explain the widely contrasting results of previous investigations of HZ N dynamics which variously identify the HZ as either a net source or sink of NO3. Our model results suggest that only estimates of residence times and O-2 uptake rates are necessary to predict this nitrification-denitrification threshold and, ultimately, whether a HZ will be either a net source or sink of NO3.Show less"
33,"Sheldon, F",Jan 2002 ,"Conservation value of variable connectivity: aquatic invertebrate assemblages of channel and floodplain habitats of a central Australian arid-zone river, Cooper Creek",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,"Rapidly expanding water resource development in arid and semi-arid zones of Australia threatens the flow regime and ecological integrity of the few large dryland rivers and their immense floodplains. Efforts to manage and conserve the surface waters of these rivers are hampered by limited scientific data on the ecology of their flora and fauna and on their responses to the high natural variability of flow regime that typifies dryland rivers. Irregular floods connect channel and floodplain wetlands to differing degrees and for varying periods of time but the ecological significance of this connectivity is poorly understood. On Cooper Creek, a large dryland river in central Australia. we explored the degree to which assemblage composition varied with connectivity and hydrological regime. Shortly after protracted regional flooding, we sampled aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages from the principal microhabitats in 12 channel and floodplain wetlands. Ephemeral and temporary lakes tended to have fewer taxa than semi-permanent channel or terminal lake habitats. Although hydrological connection had only recently been lost for some wetlands, there was already evidence of divergence in aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Disruption of the natural variability in connectivity and hydrological regime by excessive water abstraction or river-flow regulation threatens the ecological integrity and aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of dryland rivers. Preservation of the irregular flow regime and sporadic connectivity underpins conservation of the mosaic of floodplain wetlands that play such a crucial role in the ecosystem functioning of rivers such as Cooper Creek.

34,"Addy, S",May 20 2021 ,Embankment lowering and natural self-recovery improves river-floodplain hydro-geomorphic connectivity of a gravel bed river,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Floodplain reconnection can potentially improve the hydrogeomorphology of river corridors and attenuate flood peaks. However, empirical evidence of its effectiveness - needed to inform future restoration - is limited. A 70 m long flood embankment was lowered on the upper River Dee, a mediumsized gravel bed river in north-east Scotland to reconnect a backwater and floodplain. Comparison of two years pre- and three years of post-restoration hydro-geomorphic monitoring, shows the lowering and subsequent adjustment, assisted by several floods including a <1% annual exceedance probability event, have altered the morphology and hydrological dynamics. Channel aggradation of up to 1 m occurred. Erosion of the bank by up to 0.41 m in depth and deposition of gravel or sand within the backwater and the floodplain were the dominant geomorphic responses elsewhere. The channel adjustment, unexpected in the restoration design, improved hydrological connectivity with the floodplain; annual median water table levels were on average 0.037-0.089 m higher post-restoration although the correlation between river discharge and floodplain water levels did not change. Based on 1D modelling, the threshold river discharge for backwater connection decreased by 55% from 93 m(3) s(-1) (discharge exceedance percentile: Q(0.4)) to 42 m(3) s(-1) (Q8). Thus, overspill frequency increased. For a given peak discharge, floodplain water levels were higher on average by 0.25 m with a statistically significant difference (Mann Whitney U test: p < 0.05), due to improved hydrological connectivity. The monitoring demonstrates that localised but significant improvement of channel to floodplain hydro-geomorphic connectivity can result from targeted embankment lowering. Such actions could enhance future catchment resilience by improving water storage and biogeochemical processing. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
35,"Barbera, JA",Apr 2017 ,River-spring connectivity and hydrogeochemical interactions in a shallow fractured rock formation. The case study of Fuensanta river valley (Southern Spain),JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"In upland catchments, the hydrology and hydrochemistry of streams are largely influenced by groundwater inflows, at both regional and local scale. However, reverse conditions (groundwater dynamics conditioned by surface water interferences), although less described, may also occur. In this research, the local river-spring connectivity and induced hydrogeochemical interactions in intensely folded, fractured and layered Cretaceous marls and marly-limestones (Fuensanta river valley, S Spain) are discussed based on field observations, tracer tests and hydrodynamic and hydrochemical data. The differential flow measurements and tracing experiments performed in the Fuensanta river permitted us to quantify the surface water losses and to verify its direct hydraulic connection with the Fuensanta spring. The numerical simulations of tracer breakthrough curves suggest the existence of a groundwater flow system through wellconnected master and tributary fractures, with fast and multi-source flow components. Furthermore, the multivariate statistical analysis conducted using chemical data from the sampled waters, the geochemical study of water-rock interactions and the proposed water mixing approach allowed the spatial characterization of the chemistry of the springs and river/stream waters draining low permeable Cretaceous formations. Results corroborated that the mixing of surface waters, as well as calcite dissolution and CO2 dissolution/exsolution, are the main geochemical processes constraining Fuensanta spring hydrochemistry. The estimated contribution of the tributary surface waters to the spring flow during the research period was approximately 26-53% (Fuensanta river) and 47-74% (Convento stream), being predominant the first component during high flow and the second one during the dry season. The identification of secondary geochemical processes (dolomite and gypsum dissolution and dedolomitization) in Fuensanta spring waters evidences the induced hydrogeochemical changes resulting from the allogenic recharge. This research highlights the usefulness of an integrated approach based on river and spring flow examination, dye tracing interpretation and regression and multivariate statistical analysis using hydrochemical data for surface water-groundwater interaction assessment in fractured complex environments worldwide, whose implementation becomes critical for an appropriate groundwater policy.

36,"Vivien, R",Apr 10 2019 ,Assessment of the effects of wastewater treatment plant effluents on receiving streams using oligochaete communities of the porous matrix,KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS,"Human activities can disturb the natural dynamics of exchanges between surface water and groundwater in rivers. Such exchanges contribute to the self-purification of the environment and an excess of infiltration can lead to contamination of groundwater. In addition, the porous matrix (coarse surface sediments and hyporheic zone), through which water exchanges occur, is a sink for pollutants. For environmental monitoring programs, it is therefore essential to take into account both the dynamics of vertical hydrological exchanges and the biological quality of this matrix. The functional trait (FTR) method, which is based on the study of oligochaete communities in coarse surface sediments and the hyporheic zone, was proposed as a tool to simultaneously assess the dynamics of vertical hydrological exchanges and the effects of pollutants present in the porous matrix. Here, we applied this method during two different periods (in March and September 2016), upstream and downstream of locations affected by discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) located in Switzerland. The biological quality of surface sediments and the hyporheic zone was shown to be better upstream of the WWTP in both campaigns. In addition, results suggested that the capacity for self-purification was lower downstream of the WWTP, and that groundwater at these locations was vulnerable to pollution by surface water. The FTR method proved valuable as a field method for detecting the effects of point source contamination on receiving streams. In the near future, this community-based approach will benefit from advances in the use of DNA barcodes for oligochaete species identification.Show less"
37,"Beiter, D",Nov 30 2020 ,Characterising hillslope-stream connectivity with a joint event analysis of stream and groundwater levels,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Hillslope-stream connectivity controls runoff generation, during events and during baseflow conditions. However, assessing subsurface connectivity is a challenging task, as it occurs in the hidden subsurface domain where water flow can not be easily observed. We therefore investigated if the results of a joint analysis of rainfall event responses of near-stream groundwater levels and stream water levels could serve as a viable proxy for hillslope-stream connectivity. The analysis focuses on the extent of response, correlations, lag times and synchronicity. As a first step, a new data analysis scheme was developed, separating the aspects of (a) response timing and (b) extent of water level change. This provides new perspectives on the relationship between groundwater and stream responses. In a second step we investigated if this analysis can give an indication of hillslope-stream connectivity at the catchment scale.Stream water levels and groundwater levels were measured at five different hillslopes over 5 to 6 years. Using a new detection algorithm, we extracted 706 rainfall response events for subsequent analysis. Carrying out this analysis in two different geological regions (schist and marls) allowed us to test the usefulness of the proxy under different hydrological settings while also providing insight into the geologically driven differences in response behaviour.For rainfall events with low initial groundwater level, groundwater level responses often lag behind the stream with respect to the start of rise and the time of peak. This lag disappears at high antecedent groundwater levels. At low groundwater levels the relationship between groundwater and stream water level responses to rainfall are highly variable, while at high groundwater levels, above a certain threshold, this relationship tends to become more uniform. The same threshold was able to predict increased likelihood for high runoff coefficients, indicating a strong increase in connectivity once the groundwater level threshold was surpassed.The joint analysis of shallow near-stream groundwater and stream water levels provided information on the presence or absence and to a certain extent also on the degree of subsurface hillslope-stream connectivity. The underlying threshold processes were interpreted as transmissivity feedback in the marls and fill-and-spill in the schist. The value of these measurements is high; however, time series of several years and a large number of events are necessary to produce representative results. We also find that locally measured thresholds in groundwater levels can provide insight into the connectivity and event response of the corresponding headwater catchments. If the location of the well is chosen wisely, a single time series of shallow groundwater can indicate if the catchment is in a state of high or low connectivity.Show less"
38,"Pan, BZ",Jun 2011 ,"Macrozoobenthos in Yangtze floodplain lakes: patterns of density, biomass, and production in relation to river connectivity",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"A systematic investigation of macrozoobenthos was conducted in Yangtze floodplain waters to reveal patterns of density, biomass, and production in relation to river connectivity. In the Yangtze-connected lakes, 78 taxa belonging to 33 families and 62 genera were identified. Macrozoobenthos density was 327 individuals/m(2), biomass was 1.40 g dry mass/m(2), and production was 3.23 g dry mass m(-2) y(-1). The assemblages were characterized by high diversity, high production, and high bivalve-filterer abundance. The key factor determining the macrozoobenthic assemblages was river connectivity. As river connectivity increased, 3 types of response patterns were observed: 1) density, biomass, and production of collector-filterers (mainly Bivalvia), shredders (e.g., Stictochironomus), and predators (e.g., Dytiscidae) showed unimodal changes, i.e., first increased and then decreased; 2) density, biomass, and production of collector-gatherers (mainly Tubificidae and Chironomidae) decreased continuously; and 3) density of scrapers (mainly Gastropoda) decreased, whereas their biomass and production changed unimodally. At an intermediate level of river connectivity, biomass and production of total macrozoobenthos reached maxima, whereas density decreased with increasing river connectivity. Previous research showed that a diversity of zoobenthos also peaks at moderate connectivity with rivers. Therefore, to maintain high productivity as well as high biodiversity in the Yangtze floodplain, protecting the remnants of river-connected lakes and linking disconnected lakes freely with the mainstream are crucial.Show less"
39,"Ren, P",Feb 2016 ,The spatial pattern of larval fish assemblages in the lower reach of the Yangtze River: potential influences of river-lake connectivity and tidal intrusion,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Landscape pattern plays an important role in structuring of larval fish assemblages in large river basins. The lower reach of the Yangtze River includes the river section from the mouth of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, downward to the estuary. We hypothesized that river-lake connectivity at the upstream portion and tidal intrusion at the downstream portion are significant drivers of larval fish assemblages. Larval fish were collected monthly from April 2012 through September 2013 in three locations at Anqing (AQ), Nanjing (NJ), and Jingjiang (JJ). Fifty-six taxa of larval fish were identified with 52 of them determined of species. Larval fish were highly abundant from April through August; the number of species and the abundance were much higher at AQ than at NJ and JJ; the bloom of larval fish at JJ tended to be later than at NJ and AQ. We suggest that the larger number of species and higher abundance of larval fish at AQ reflect the effects of the connectivity of Poyang Lake with the river upstream of AQ, and the delayed bloom of larval fish and the occurrence of estuarine species at JJ reflect the influences of tidal intrusion from the estuary.Show less"

These factors depend fundamentally on hydrology and geomorphology of the channel and floodplain. We discuss application of an index of river-floodplain connectivity, the Land Capability Potential Index (LCPI), to regional-scale restoration planning along 600 km of the Lower Missouri River. The LCPI integrates modeled water-surface elevations, floodplain topography, and soils to index relative wetness of floodplain patches. Geomorphic adjustment of the Lower Missouri River to impoundment and channel engineering has altered the natural relations among hydrology, geomorphology, and floodplain soils, and has resulted in a regional upstream to downstream gradient in connectivity potential. As a result, flow-regime management is limited in its capacity to restore floodplain ecosystems. The LCPI provides a tool for identifying and mapping floodplain restoration potential, accounting for the geomorphic adjustment. Using simple criteria, we illustrate the utility of LCPI-like approaches in regional planning for restoration of plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides) communities, hydrologically connected floodplain wetlands, and seasonal floodplain wetlands.Show less"

Model results are generally highly correlated with observations from the Georgia Coastal Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research (GCE-LTER) program, revealing a high degree of salinity variability at the Altamaha River and Doboy Sound, decreasing sharply toward Sapelo Sound. A Lagrangian particle tracking method is used to investigate local residence time and connectivity in the system. Local residence time is highly variable, increasing with distance from the Altamaha River and decreasing with river flow, revealing that discharge plays a dominant role on transport processes and estuary-shelf exchange. The Altamaha River and Doboy Sound are connected to each other in all seasons, with exchange occurring both via coastal and estuarine pathways. While particles released at the Altamaha and Doboy rarely reach Sapelo Sound, particles released at Sapelo Sound and the creeks surrounding its main channel can reach the entire estuarine system.Show less"

Didymo grows in thick mats in several river systems on the South Island of New Zealand, often smothering entire river beds. Salmonid eggs, deposited in gravel nests (redds), depend on constant water exchange across the riverbed to provide oxygen-rich water for development. Thick didymo mats might restrict the flow of oxygen-rich water into spawning gravels, resulting in increased egg mortality and reduced trout recruitment. The present study measured hyporheic hydraulic conditions in trout redds with varying didymo cover in the Clutha River catchment, South Island, New Zealand. Didymo cover had no significant effects on several hydraulic variables (flow into the substrate, hydraulic conductivity and hyporheic oxygen concentration). However, there was a significant difference in the potential surface water-groundwater exchange between sites, suggesting some effect of didymo on hydraulic conditions. Considering the limited number of replicates, the impact of didymo on trout redds in the Clutha River cannot be excluded. The present study highlights the need for further research on the possible effects of didymo on important surface water-groundwater exchange processes.Show less"

First, some methodological questions remained unanswered regarding the interactions between biodiversity and physical processes, both for the study of habitat characteristics and interactions at different scales. Furthermore, many questions remain to be addressed to help inform our understanding of invertebrate community dynamics, especially regarding the trophic niches of organisms, the functional groups present within sediment, and their temporal changes. Understanding microbial community dynamics would require investigations about their relationship with the physical characteristics of the sediment, their diversity, their relationship with metabolic pathways, their interactions with invertebrates, and their response to environmental stress. Another fundamental research question is that of the importance of the hyporheic zone in the global metabolism of the river, which must be explored in relation to organic matter recycling, the effects of disturbances, and the degradation of contaminants. Finally, the application of this knowledge requires the development of methods for the estimation of hydrological exchanges, especially for the management of sediment clogging, the optimization of self-purification, and the integration of climate change in environmental policies. The development of descriptors of hyporheic zone health and of new metrology is also crucial to include specific targets in water policies for the long-term management of the system and a clear evaluation of restoration strategies.Show less"

However, the responses of hyporheic microbial assemblage structure and activity to environmental variables remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of hyporheic zone characteristics on microbial assemblages in three French rivers (Usses, Isere and Drome). For each river, microbial structure (assemblage composition and abundance) and activity were measured at three sites with contrasting environmental characteristics (e.g. effective streambed porosity, oxygen and nutrient concentrations). Firstly, we expected that the structure and activity of the hyporheic microbial assemblage would be significantly affected by the environmental characteristics of the hyporheic zone. We also expected a strong relationship between the structure and activity of hyporheic microbial communities in the Usses River, due to greater spatial heterogeneity (i.e. greater porosity differences between the studied sites) compared with the two other rivers. Our results showed that porosity reduction, greatest in the Usses River, affected the exchanges of flows and energy through the hyporheic zone and, consequently, led to a distinct microbial assemblage composition in comparison with the two other rivers. Significant relationships between bacterial assemblage structure and activity were detected for the Usses and Drome rivers, due to the greater spatial variability in sediment and physicochemical variables observed in these two rivers than in the Isere. Hyporheic zone characteristics (sediment permeability, water chemistry, particulate organic matter) appear to be the key factors controlling microbial structure and activity in riverine environments. As the hyporheic zone is essential for biogeochemical processes, including those attenuating pollution, a better quantification of the influences of environmental factors controlling microbial activity is needed to understand and predict ecosystem processes in the hyporheic zone.Show less"

The relative importance of the contributions of long-wave radiation, conductive, and evaporative heat fluxes are in descending order. The air temperature is the most important meteorological factor to the total heat flux. Although the wind speed influences evaporative and conductive heat fluxes, it has the least correlation with the total heat budget. The heat exchange coefficient for the linearized surface heat exchange equation is 21.87 W/(m(2) degrees C), which is comparable with published values in the regions of United States and Canada with similar latitudes.Show less"
47,"Hohne, A",Oct 1 2022 ,Fate of trace organic compounds in the hyporheic zone: Influence of microbial metabolism,WATER RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is considered a hydrodynamically-driven bioreactor with significant pollutant removal capacities and can therefore not only improve wholestream water quality but also preserve human and ecosystem health. Microbial metabolism is hypothesized to play a key role in pollutant transformation in hyporheic sediments of natural streams. However, previous work investigating the influence of microbial metabolism on pollutant transformation has been predominantly laboratory studies. The key challenge for field studies is the appropriate determination of net microbial metabolism, i.e. information on the actual exposure times to specific microbial processes in the investigated system. The present study uses reactive fluorescent tracers to determine microbial metabolism and ultimately its influence on pollutant transformation, e.g. for trace organic compounds, in hyporheic sediments under natural conditions. In particular, the reactive fluorescent tracers resazurin and its main transformation product resorufin were used to determine the microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes. The influence of the derived microbial metabolism on the transformation of 20 trace organic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals, including 3 parent-daughter pairs, was examined. The present findings validate laboratory results on the microbially-mediated transformation of the anticonvulsant gabapentin to its main transformation product gabapentin lactam under natural conditions. All other TrOCs investigated did not show a clear link between TrOC reactivity to the microbial metabolism informed by the resazurin-resorufin-system. Overall, the present study not only demonstrates the use of the fluorescent tracer-system resazurin and resorufin for determining microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes but also generally highlights the potential of reactive fluorescent tracers to disentangle specific reactive properties and ultimately their influence on the fate of pollutants in natural HZs.Show less"
48,"Karim, F",Aug 30 2012 ,"Modelling wetland connectivity during overbank flooding in a tropical floodplain in north Queensland, Australia",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hydrological connectivity between floodplain wetlands and rivers is one of the principal driving mechanisms for the diversity, productivity and interactions of the major biota in riverfloodplain systems. This article describes a method of quantifying flood-induced overbank connectivity using a hydrodynamic model (MIKE 21) to calculate the timing, the duration and the spatial extent of the connections between several floodplain wetlands and rivers in the TullyMurray catchment, north Queensland, Australia. Areal photogrammetry and field surveyed stream cross data were used to reproduce floodplain topography and rivers in the model. Laser altimetry (LiDAR)derived fine resolution elevation data, for the central floodplain, were added to the topography model to improve the resolution of key features including wetlands, flow pathways and natural and artificial flow barriers. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated using a combination of in-stream and floodplain gauge records. A range of off-stream wetlands including natural and artificial, small and large were investigated for their connectivity with two main rivers (Tully and Murray) flowing over the floodplain for flood events of 1-, 20- and 50-year recurrence intervals. The duration of the connection of individual wetlands varied from 1 to 12?days, depending on flood magnitude and location in the floodplain, with some wetlands only connected during large floods. All of the wetlands studied were connected to the Tully River for shorter periods than they were to the Murray River because of the higher bank heights and levees on the Tully River and wetland proximity to the Murray River. Other than hydrology, land relief, riverbank elevation and levee banks along the river were found key factors controlling the degree of connectivity. These variations in wetland connectivity could have important implications for aquatic biota that move between rivers and off-stream habitats during floods.
