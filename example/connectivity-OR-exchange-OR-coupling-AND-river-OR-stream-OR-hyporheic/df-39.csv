In this study, we measured sapflow in 26 trees of two dominant floodplain forest species (Celtis laevigata and Quercus lyrata) at two hydrologically distinct sites in the lower White River floodplain in Arkansas, USA. Our objective was to investigate how connectivity-driven water table variations affected water use, an indicator of tree function. Meteorological variables (photosynthetically active radiation and vapor pressure deficit) were the dominant controls over water use at both sites; however, water table variations explained some site differences. At the wetter site, highest sapflow rates were during a late-season overbank flooding event, and no flood stress was apparent. At the drier site, sapflow decreased as the water table receded. The late-season flood pulse that resulted in flooding at the wetter site did not affect the water table at the drier site; accordingly, higher water use was not observed at the drier site. The species generally associated with wetter conditions (Q. lyrata) was more positively responsive to the flood pulse. Flood water subsidy lengthened the effective growing season, demonstrating ecological implications of hydrologic connectivity for alleviating water deficits that otherwise reduce function in this humid floodplain wetland.Show less"
1,"Folster, J",Feb 15 2001 ,Significance of processes in the near-stream zone on stream water acidity in a small acidified forested catchment,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The near-stream zone has received increasing attention owing to its influence on stream water chemistry in general and acidity in particular. Possible processes in this zone include cation exchange, leaching of organic matter and redox reactions of sulphur compounds. III this study the influences of processes in the near-stream zone on the acidity in runoff from a small, acidified catchment in central southern Sweden were investigated. The study included sampling of groundwater, soil water and stream water along with hydrological measurements. An input-output budget for the catchment was established based on data from the International Go-operative Programme on Integrated Monitoring at this site.The catchment was heavily acidified by deposition of anthropogenic sulphur, with pH in stream water between 4.4 and 4.6. There was also no relationship between stream flow and pH, which is indicative of chronic acidification. Indications of microbial reduction of sulphate were found in some places near the stream, but the near-stream zone did not have a general impact on the sulphate concentration in discharging groundwater. The near-stream zone was a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the stream, which had a median DOC of 6.8 mg L-1. The influence on stream acidity from organic anions was overshadowed by the effect of sulphate, however, except during a spring flow episode, when additional organic matter was flushed out and the sulphate-rich ground water was mixed with more diluted event water. Ion exchange was not an important process in the near-stream zone of the Kindla catchment. Different functions of the near-stream zone relating to discharge acidity are reported in the literature. In this study there was even a variation within the site. There is therefore a need for more case studies to provide a more detailed understanding of the net effects that the near-stream zone can have on stream chemistry under different circumstances.

3,"Cucchi, K",Sep 3 2021 ,Estimating Hydrothermal Properties and High-Frequency Fluxes From Geophysical Measurements in the Hyporheic Zone,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Located in the critical zone at the intersection between surface water and groundwater, hyporheic zones (HZ) host a variety of hydrological, biological and biogeochemical processes regulating water availability and quality and sustaining riverine ecosystems. However, difficulty in quantifying water fluxes along this interface has limited our understanding of these processes, in particular under dynamic flow conditions where rapid variations can impact large-scale HZ biogeochemical function. In this study, we introduce an innovative measurement assimilation chain for determining uncertainty-quantified hydraulic and thermal HZ properties, as well as associated uncertainty-quantified high-frequency water fluxes. The chain consists in the assimilation of data collected with the LOMOS-mini geophysical device with a process-based, Bayesian approach. The application of this approach on a synthetic case study shows that hydraulic and thermal HZ properties can be estimated from LOMOS-mini measurements, their identifiability depending on the Peclet number - summarizing the hydrological and thermal regime. Hydraulic conductivity values can be estimated with precision when greater than similar to 10(-5)m center dot s(-1) when other HZ properties are unknown, with decreasing uncertainty when other HZ properties are known prior to starting the LOMOS-mini measurement assimilation procedure. Water fluxes can be estimated in all regimes with varying accuracy, highest accuracy is reached for fluxes greater than similar to 10(-6)m center dot s(-1), except under highly conductive exfiltration regimes. We apply the methodology on in situ datasets by deriving uncertainty-quantified HZ properties and water fluxes for 2 data points collected during field campaigns. This study demonstrates that the LOMOS-mini monitoring technology can be used as complete and stand-alone sampling solution for quantifying water and heat exchanges under dynamic exchange conditions (time resolution < 15 min).Show less"
4,"Leyer, I",Aug 2006 ,"Dispersal, diversity and distribution patterns in pioneer vegetation: The role of river-floodplain connectivity",JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Question: Are there changes in dispersal patterns in floodplain pioneer vegetation with effects on seedling number, species richness and species composition along a gradient of declining river-floodplain connectivity?Location: Middle Elbe river floodplain, Germany.Methods: An experiment with five treatments was set up along a gradient of declining river-floodplain connectivity, partitioning seedlings into three groups: (1) emerging solely from water dispersed seeds, (2) from wind/animal dispersed seeds and (3) from the soil diaspore bank. Two controls were established: without any manipulation and exclusion of all seeds. The results were compared with those of vegetation and soil sampling to evaluate the representativeness of the experimental sites in terms of species composition, diversity, seedling number and soil parameters.Results: Water dispersal and the soil diaspore bank were the major dispersal strategies shaping floodplain pioneer vegetation at the Middle Elbe river. The number of seedlings, species richness and the variation in species composition in these habitats depend on the degree of connectivity. The seedling number and species richness is highest in sites of permanent or almost permanent exchange with the main channel, where water dispersal additionally contributes to the number of seedlings grown from the soil seed bank.Conclusion: The results underline the importance of river-floodplain ecotones as sink habitats for water-dispersed seeds. Considering the strongly reduced river-floodplain interactions due to dykes and other engineering structures, management strategies are necessary to improve connectivity and the renewal of fluvial land forms.Show less"
5,"Marion, A",Sep 25 2008 ,Hyporheic flows in stratified beds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Surface-subsurface exchange fluxes are receiving increasing interest because of their importance in the fate of contaminants, nutrients, and other ecologically relevant substances in a variety of aquatic systems. Solutions have previously been developed for pore water flows induced by geometrical irregularities such as bed forms for the cases of homogeneous sediment beds and idealized heterogeneous beds, but these solutions have not accounted for the fact that streambed sediments are subject to sorting processes that often produce well-defined subsurface structures. Sediments at the streambed surface are often coarser than the underlying material because of size-selective sediment transport, producing relatively thin armor layers. Episodic erosional and depositional processes also create thick layers of different composition within the porous medium, forming stratified beds. A series of experiments were conducted to observe conservative solute transport in armored and stratified beds. An analytical solution was developed for advective exchange with stratified beds and provides appropriate scaling of the physical variables that control exchange flows. The results show that armor layers are too thin to significantly alter the advective pumping process but provide significant solute storage at short time scales. Stratified beds with layers of significant thickness favor development of horizontal flow paths within the bed and change the rate of solute transfer across the stream-subsurface interface compared to homogeneous beds.Show less"
6,"Lakhanpal, G",,"Micro-computed tomography scanning approaches to quantify, parameterize and visualize bioturbation activity in clogged streambeds: A proof of concept",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Fine particle clogging and faunal bioturbation are two key processes co-occurring in the hyporheic zone that potentially affect hyporheic exchange through modifications in the sediment structure of streambeds. Clogging results from excessive fine sediment infiltration and deposition in rivers, and it is known to decrease matrix porosity and potentially reduce permeability. Faunal bioturbation activity may compensate for the negative effect of clogging by reworking the sediment, increasing porosity, and preventing further infiltration of fines. Although both processes of clogging and bioturbation have received significant attention in the literature separately, their combined effects on streambed sediment structure are not well understood, mostly due to the lack of a standard methodology for their assessment. Here, we illustrate a novel methodology using X-ray computed tomography (CT), as proof of concept, to investigate how, together, clogging and bioturbation affect streambed porosity in a controlled flow-through flume. By visualising gallery formations of an upward conveyor macroinvertebrate; Lumbriculus variegatus as a model species, we quantified bioturbation activity in a clogged streambed, focusing on orientation, depth, and volume at downwelling and upwelling areas of the flume. Gallery creation increased the porosity of the streambed sediment, suggesting a potential improvement in permeability and a possible offset of clogging effects. We illustrate the promising use of X-ray CT as a tool to assess bioturbation in clogged streambeds, and the potential role of bioturbation activity supporting hyporheic exchange processes in streambeds, warranting further studies to understand the extent of bioturbation impacts in natural systems.Show less"
7,"Persic, V",Oct 2011 ,Spatial Distribution of Nutrient Limitation in the Danube River Floodplain in Relation to Hydrological Connectivity,WETLANDS,"In this paper, we describe the influence of flooding on nutrient conditions and phytoplankton Chl-a concentrations in a hydrologically dynamic Danube floodplain in North-Eastern Croatia. Based on hydrological typology, the connectivity gradient extends from the main river stream (Eupotamal) to the backwater channels and side-arms (Parapotamal) to the edge of the floodplain (Paleopotamal). A spatial gradient of phytoplankton Chl-a occurred during low water levels, while uniformity of Chl-a across wetland habitats was observed during high water levels. Nutrient enrichment assays indicated that inorganic nutrients in Eupotamal waters (N/P ratio 16-22) could support a higher growth rate of the assay alga Chlorella kessleri, while potential N limitation was found in Parapotamal and Paleopotamal waters (both with N/P ratios< 14). Spatial expansion of N limitation toward the main river was observed as inundation continued. Lateral flood pulse connectivity along with the duration of inundation period affects the input and the retention of nutrients, especially of nitrogen. Understanding of the relationship between spatial (location of the floodplain waterbodies regarding the river) and temporal (hydrological connectivity between the river and its floodplain) dimensions contribute to the importance of healthy floodplains for the maintenance of water quality and environmental conditions in the Danube River.Show less"
8,"Price, JM",Mar 15 2015 ,Influences of sudden changes in discharge and physical stream characteristics on transient storage and nitrate uptake in an urban stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Changes in the physical structure of urban streams can occur abruptly due to flashy high-flow events and subsequently alter stream processes, including transient storage and nitrate uptake. We examined temporal variability in transient storage and nitrate uptake by exploring the effects of altered physical characteristics resulting from a single high-flow event in three reaches of Spring Creek, an urban stream in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. Study reaches of varying geomorphic and hydraulic characteristics were chosen to represent distinct geomorphic settings in terms of substrate size, sinuosity, bed slope, and degree of rehabilitation and structural controls. We performed detailed physical characterizations and multiple nutrient injections of Br- and NO3- to estimate transient storage and nitrate uptake in each reach. A comparison of pre-flood and post-flood data indicates that transient storage and nitrate uptake are highly context specific and mediated by interactions between geomorphic setting and flood discharge. In the two reaches that showed significant post-flood increases in transient storage (250% to 350% increases in F-med(200)), the pool-riffle reach exhibited a significant increase in uptake velocity, while the channelized reach did not. In contrast, transient storage decreased post-flood in the third reach containing hydraulic structures. These complex responses likely reflect reach-specific differences in hyporheic versus in-channel storage. This study shows that repeat injections are necessary to describe nutrient dynamics because transient storage and nitrate uptake can be highly variable over time (showing changes on the order of 100%) due to variation in discharge and geomorphically influential flow events.

9,"Stein, JL",Jun 15 2002 ,Spatial analysis of anthropogenic river disturbance at regional and continental scales: identifying the wild rivers of Australia,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,"A method for assessing anthropogenic river disturbance is described. The grid-based spatial modeling procedure computes indices of disturbance for individual stream sections. These indices rank streams along a continuum from near-pristine to severely disturbed. The method couples geographical data, recording the extent and intensity of human activities known to impact on river condition, with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used for drainage analysis. It was developed to produce the first nation-wide assessment of river disturbance from which Australia's least disturbed or 'wild' rivers were identified. A national summary of the extent and the potential impact of human activities is presented, calculated from the disturbance index values computed for more than 1.5 x 10(6) stream sections with a total length of over 3 x 10(6) km. Index values close to the undisturbed end of the continuum are rare, especially among large rivers. Most of the least disturbed streams are predicted to lie within the monsoonal tropical north or the arid/semi-arid center of the continent.The disturbance indices generated provide a comprehensive and consistent characterization of river and catchment disturbance that has applications beyond the identification of wild rivers. These include identification of priorities for rehabilitation and restoration; development of systematic survey strategies for aquatic, riparian and estuarine biota and identification of reserve networks for river systems. However, these applications depend on validating the correlation between river disturbance indices and intensively sampled physical and biological indicators of river condition.

10,"Jiang, R",Sep 2015 ,Water connectivity in hillslope of upland-riparian zone and the implication for stream nitrate-N export during rain events in an agricultural and forested watershed,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Water connectivity in the hillslopes of the upland-riparian zone has environmental implications for stream nitrate-N (NO3 (-)-N) export during rain events. This study was conducted to measure the shallow groundwater table over a hillslope with upland, interface, and riparian forest components and measure the stream NO3 (-)-N concentrations in a 36.6 km(2) agricultural and forested watershed (AFW) in the Shibetsu area of northern Japan from July to November 2009. The groundwater and stream hydrographs at seasonal and rain event scales indicated that the hillslope water connectivity was first established from the riparian forest, and then expanded to the upland after several rain events. The hillslope water connectivity has important implications for NO3 (-)-N export in the watershed since the NO3 (-)-N export may primarily be explained by a flushing mechanism. The NO3 (-)-N export only flushed from riparian forest during the early water connection stage. While in the well water connection stage, the flush of NO3 (-)-N occurred with the subsurface flow from the upland which had a high shallow groundwater table and displayed higher stream NO3 (-)-N concentrations. However, lower stream NO3 (-)-N concentrations occurred during the late water connection stage and indicated that the N source in the upland might be limited due to denitrification and NO3 (-)-N leaching processes. Nevertheless, it was decided that the hydrology and biogeochemical reactions occurring in the upland controlled the stream NO3 (-)-N export. A conceptual model was formulated that explained the impacts of the hillslope water connectivity on the watershed stream NO3 (-)-N export during rain events in early, well, and late water connection stages within the AFW.Show less"
11,"Zibret, G",Jul 2017 ,"Multi-elemental composition of the Sava River sediments (Slovenia, EU)",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"The Sava River is the longest river in Slovenia and has been subjected to pollution in the past. Fine-grained channel sediments, whichwere deposited during the high-water event in July 2009, along the river course in Slovenia were sampled at 12 locations in order to determine the content of a large set of chemical elements and assess possible levels of pollution. Sediment samples were air-dried. Two grain size fractions (<0.063 and <0.125 mm) were prepared for chemical analyses by dry sieving. Elemental levels of each sample were determined after aqua regia extraction (1 h, 95 degrees C) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Elemental levels did not exceed the legislation action limit values, indicating that the Sava River recently deposited alluvial sediments are not contaminated with potentially toxic metals. The results show that the chemical composition of the Sava River sediments is comparable to the average composition of stream sediments within Europe. Some light impacts of anthropogenic activities and lithological-driven influential factors to the elemental composition of sediments were observed. Slight As enrichment is possibly a consequence of eroding of slag dumps and Ascontaminated soil on Sava River banks and emissions from treated sewage waters. Lead (Pb) is increased in the Litija area as a consequence of historic mining and increased zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations after the Savinja River confluence because of historic smelting industry in its catchment area. Phosphorous levels in sediments are very likely driven by the emissions from farming and urbanisation. Increased Ba and Pb levels (but still being below the action value) are detected in sample downstream Krsko.Show less"
12,"Bhaskar, AS",Aug 29 2012 ,Resolving hyporheic and groundwater components of streambed water flux using heat as a tracer,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic and groundwater fluxes typically occur together in permeable sediments beneath flowing stream water. However, streambed water fluxes quantified using the thermal method are usually interpreted as representing either groundwater or hyporheic fluxes. Our purpose was to improve understanding of co-occurring groundwater and hyporheic fluxes using streambed temperature measurements and analysis of one-dimensional heat transport in shallow streambeds. First, we examined how changes in hyporheic and groundwater fluxes affect their relative magnitudes by reevaluating previously published simulations. These indicated that flux magnitudes are largely independent until a threshold is crossed, past which hyporheic fluxes are diminished by much larger (1000-fold) groundwater fluxes. We tested accurate quantification of co-occurring fluxes using one-dimensional approaches that are appropriate for analyzing streambed temperature data collected at field sites. The thermal analytical method, which uses an analytical solution to the one-dimensional heat transport equation, was used to analyze results from a numerical heat transport model, in which hyporheic flow was represented as increased thermal dispersion at shallow depths. We found that co-occurring groundwater and hyporheic fluxes can be quantified in streambeds, although not always accurately. For example, using a temperature time series collected in a sandy streambed, we found that hyporheic and groundwater flow could both be detected when thermal dispersion due to hyporheic flow was significant compared to thermal conduction. We provide guidance for when thermal data can be used to quantify both hyporheic and groundwater fluxes, and we show that neglecting thermal dispersion may affect accuracy and interpretation of estimated streambed water fluxes.Show less"
13,"Cid, N",Jan 1 2016 ,A biological tool to assess flow connectivity in reference temporary streams from the Mediterranean Basin,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Many streams in the Mediterranean Basin have temporary flow regimes. While timing for seasonal drought is predictable, they undergo strong inter-annual variability in flow intensity. This high hydrological variability and associated ecological responses challenge the ecological status assessment of temporary streams, particularly when setting reference conditions. This study examined the effects of flow connectivity in aquatic macroinvertebrates from seven reference temporary streams across the Mediterranean Basin where hydrological variability and flow conditions are well studied. We tested for the effect of flow cessation on two streamflow indices and on community composition, and, by performing random forest and classification tree analyses we identified important biological predictors for classifying the aquatic state either as flowing or disconnected pools. Flow cessation was critical for one of the streamflow indices studied and for community composition. Macroinvertebrate families found to be important for classifying the aquatic state were Hydrophilidae, Simuliidae, Hydropsychidae, Planorbiidae, Heptageniidae and Gerridae. For biological traits, trait categories associated to feeding habits, food, locomotion and substrate relation were the most important and provided more accurate predictions compared to taxonomy. A combination of selected metrics and associated thresholds based on the most important biological predictors (i.e. Bio-AS Tool) were proposed in order to assess the aquatic state in reference temporary streams, especially in the absence of hydrological data. Although further development is needed, the tool can be of particular interest for monitoring, restoration, and conservation purposes, representing an important step towards an adequate management of temporary rivers not only in the Mediterranean Basin but also in other regions vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

15,"Giblin, SM",Sep 2020 ,Environmental factors controlling phytoplankton dynamics in a large floodplain river with emphasis on cyanobacteria,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Harmful algal blooms are occurring in large river ecosystems and at the mouth of large rivers with increasing frequency. In lentic systems, the chemical and physical conditions that promote harmful algal blooms are somewhat predictable but tracking prevalence and conditions that promote harmful algal blooms in lotic systems is much more difficult. We captured two of the most extreme discharge years within the last 20 years occurring in the Upper Mississippi River, allowing a natural experiment that evaluated how major shifts in discharge drive environmental variation and associated shifts in phytoplankton. Statistical models describing significant environmental covariates for phytoplankton assemblages and specific taxa were developed and used to identify management-relevant numeric breakpoints at which environmental variables may promote the growth of specific phytoplankton and/or cyanobacteria. Our analyses supported that potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria dominate under high phosphorus concentration, low nitrogen concentration, low nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio, low turbulence, low flushing, adequate light and warm temperatures. Cyanobacteria dominated in 2009 when low discharge and low flushing likely led to optimal growth environments forDolichospermum,AphanizomenonandMicrocystis. Rarely will a single factor lead to the dominance, but multiple positive factors working in concert can lead to cyanobacteria proliferation in large rivers. Certain isolated backwaters with high phosphorus, low nitrogen, warm water temperatures and low potential for flushing could benefit from increased connection to channel inputs to reduce cyanobacterial dominance. Numerous examples of this type of habitat currently exist in the Upper Mississippi River and could benefit from reconnection to channel habitats.Show less"
16,"Whitney, JE",Dec 2015 ,Consecutive wildfires affect stream biota in cold- and warmwater dryland river networks,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Climate change and fire suppression have altered fire regimes globally, leading to larger, more frequent, and more severe wildfires. Responses of coldwater stream biota to single wildfires are well studied, but measured responses to consecutive wildfires in warmwater systems that often include mixed assemblages of native and nonnative taxa are lacking. We quantified changes in physical habitat, resource availability, and biomass of cold- and warmwater oligochaetes, insects, crayfish, fishes, and tadpoles following consecutive megafires (covering >100 km(2)) in the upper Gila River, New Mexico, USA. We were particularly interested in comparing responses of native and nonnative fishes that might have evolved under different disturbance regimes. Changes in habitat and resource availability were related to cumulative fire effects, fire size, and postfire precipitation. The 2nd of 2 consecutive wildfires in the basin was larger and, coupled with moderate postfire discharge, resulted in increased siltation and decreased algal biomass. Several insect taxa responded to these fires with reduced biomass, whereas oligochaete biomass was unaffected. Biomass of 6 of 7 native fish species decreased after the fires, and decreases were associated with site proximity to fire. Nonnative fish decreases after fire were most pronounced for coldwater salmonids, and warmwater nonnative fishes exhibited limited responses. All crayfish and tadpoles collected were nonnative and were unresponsive to fire disturbance. More pronounced responses of native insects and fishes to fires indicate that increasing fire size and frequency threatens the persistence of native fauna and suggests that management activities promoting ecosystem resilience might help ameliorate wildfire effects.Show less"
17,"Greulich, RS",Oct 29 2020 ,Shared functional connectivity between the dorso-medial and dorso-ventral streams in macaques,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Manipulation of an object requires us to transport our hand towards the object (reach) and close our digits around that object (grasp). In current models, reach-related information is propagated in the dorso-medial stream from posterior parietal area V6A to medial intraparietal area, dorsal premotor cortex, and primary motor cortex. Grasp-related information is processed in the dorso-ventral stream from the anterior intraparietal area to ventral premotor cortex and the hand area of primary motor cortex. However, recent studies have cast doubt on the validity of this separation in separate processing streams. We investigated in 10 male rhesus macaques the whole-brain functional connectivity of these areas using resting state fMRI at 7-T. Although we found a clear separation between dorso-medial and dorso-ventral network connectivity in support of the two-stream hypothesis, we also found evidence of shared connectivity between these networks. The dorso-ventral network was distinctly correlated with high-order somatosensory areas and feeding related areas, whereas the dorso-medial network with visual areas and trunk/hindlimb motor areas. Shared connectivity was found in the superior frontal and precentral gyrus, central sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, precuneus, and insular cortex. These results suggest that while sensorimotor processing streams are functionally separated, they can access information through shared areas.Show less"
18,"Winemiller, KO",Mar 2023 ,Can spatial food web subsidies associated with river hydrology and lateral connectivity be detected using stable isotopes?,FOOD WEBS,"During and following lateral connections, aquatic organisms residing in the river channel may assimilate material from sources imported from oxbows, and oxbow residents may consume and assimilate material imported from the channel. Hydrology, lateral connectivity, and stable isotope ratios of fishes and mussels were analyzed for evidence of spatial food web subsidies between the active channel and oxbow lakes in the floodplain of the Guadalupe River, Texas. During surveys conducted between March 2016 and April 2017, fish, mussel, periphyton, seston, and riparian plant samples were collected in and around two oxbows and adjacent channel sites for analysis of stable isotope ratios. Biplots of 813C and 815N were graphed for basal sources and specimens of six common fish species, four sunfish species (Lepomis spp. combined), and two mussel species (Unionidae combined) captured from oxbows and the channel. Within each graph, polygons were drawn to indicate the space occupied by animals that could have assimilated feasible combinations of source materials originating from either oxbows or the river channel. Based on positions of animals within source polygons, riparian C4 grasses were not an important source of organic matter supporting biomass of fishes and mussels within the channel or oxbows. Overall, 84% of organisms had isotopic signatures consistent with assimilation of in situ sources, but also 76% of all organisms were inconclusive with regards to cross-habitat exchanges. Outliers that may have assimilated ex situ source material were observed for only 4% of 313 organisms from oxbows and 9% of 232 organisms from the channel, and some but not all of these cases followed high flow pulses that connected oxbows for extended periods. Several issues that compromise inferences from stable isotope analysis were identified, and estimation of spatial food web subsidies in fluvial systems could be enhanced by analyzing additional biomarkers, such as isotopic ratios of other elements and compound-specific stable isotopes, as well as additional sources, timespecific biotracers, and experimental approaches that directly track movement of sources and organisms in spatially structured food webs.Show less"
19,"Franciskovic-Bilinski, S",Mar 2014 ,Magnetic spherules in sediments of the karstic Dobra River (Croatia),JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"The paper describes an unusual finding of magnetic particles in stream sediments of the karstic Dobra River (Croatia). It aims to investigate the magnetic susceptibility properties of river sediments and to find links with their mineralogical and chemical composition. The goal of our research was to suggest the possible origin of magnetic particles in the river sediments within the Dinaric karst region, which to our knowledge was not exposed to metal manufacturing processes.A preliminary, exploratory sediment sampling programme was undertaken. Sediments were collected near the channel bank (from the top layer) at 16 representative stations distributed along the length of the Dobra River (110 km). Sediments were air-dried and passed through 2-mm and 63-mu m sieves, and analysed for magnetic susceptibility (and Curie temperature), isothermal remanent magnetism (IRM), stereo-microscopy of separated magnetic grains, mineralogical analysis (using X-ray diffraction), and chemical analysis (using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry).Increased magnetic susceptibility and IRM values were observed mostly in the sediments of the Upper Dobra. Thermomagnetic curves show a distinctive Curie-point of magnetite at 580 A degrees C. Additional transformation observed at 520-560 A degrees C derives from titanomagnetite. There was no significant correlation between magnetic susceptibility and Fe. Magnetic particles from the Dobra River sediments contain pyroxene, plagioclase, hematite and quartz, in addition to magnetite. White spherules within magnetic grains are also present. The major constituent of five separated magnetic spherules is Fe; the minor constituents are Al, Ca, Mg and Si, and there are numerous trace elements (Ba, Cr, K, Mn, Na, Ni, Ti and V). The ratio Ni/ Fe versus Cr/Fe suggests that the magnetic spherules are impactites.Magnetic spherules were discovered for the first time in stream sediments of the sinking karstic Dobra River, a region where anthropogenic sources for that contribution are absent. Preliminary results point to a possible impactite, formed either by a shock event caused by a meteorite impact or by volcanic processes. The presence of magnetic spherules in the fluvial sediments of the Upper Dobra River represents a new and exciting finding and deserves further field work and laboratory research.Show less"
20,"Khosronejad, A",Jul 2015 ,Numerical simulation of large dunes in meandering streams and rivers with in-stream rock structures,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The evolution and migration of large dunes in a realistic intermediate-size experimental stream, the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) Outdoor StreamLab (OSL), and two large-scale meandering rivers with in-stream rock structures are studied numerically using the SAFL Virtual StreamLab hydro-morphodynamic (VSL3D) model. Due to the challenges arising from mesh quality and large disparity in time-scales, coupled morpho- and hydro-dynamics simulations of bed forms has, for the most part, been restricted to sand wave amplitudes of few centimeters. In this work, we overcome such difficulties by employing the immersed boundary approach and a dual time-stepping technique of the VSL3D model [63]. The VSL3D employs the curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) method along with a suspended sediment load module and is capable of simulating turbulent stratified flows coupled with bed morphodynamic evolution in realistic riverine environments with arbitrarily complex hydraulic structures. Turbulence is handled either via large-eddy simulation (LES) with the dynamic Smagorinski subgrid scale model or unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) equations closed with the k - omega turbulence model. Simulations in the intermediate-scale OSL channel, in which we also collected experimental morphodynamic data, show that LES can capture the evolution and migration of bed forms with characteristics that are in good agreement with experimental measurements. The URANS model, however, fails to excite the bed instability in the OSL channel but captures realistic dune evolution in the two large-scale meandering rivers. This finding is especially important as it demonstrates the potential of the VSL3D model as a powerful tool for simulating morphodynamic evolution under prototype conditions. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to simulate large-scale bed forms in waterways with an order of magnitude disparity in spatial scales, from the similar to 2.7 m wide OSL channel to the 27 m wide rivers. Accordingly, the height of the simulated dunes ranges from similar to 0.2 m to 2.0 m and the wavelength ranges from similar to 0.1 m to 50 m for the OSL and large-scale rivers, respectively. For all cases the statistical properties of the simulated bed forms are shown to agree well with those of bed forms observed in nature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
21,"Jerin, T",Feb 15 2021 ,Scale associated coupling between channel morphology and riparian vegetation in a bedrock-controlled stream,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Most fluvial systems exhibit systematic, continuous upstream to downstream variations in channel morphology and related ecological and hydrological parameters (emphasized by conceptual frameworks such as downstream hydraulic geometry and the river continuum concept), and discontinuous, shorter range variations (emphasized by hierarchical patch dynamics). This study investigates the relative importance of broader-scale upstream to downstream variation and local variation at the hydraulic unit scale in a bedrock-controlled stream in central Kentucky, USA. A nested ANOVA analytical approach was used to determine the relative importance of three nested spatial scales in explaining variations in channel morphology and riparian trees. Results show that channel morphology is largely controlled by local-scale variation explaining about 92% of slope, 46% of bankfull width, 99% of average depth, 54% of width-depth ratio, 86% of channel cross-sectional area, and 100% of the hydraulic radius of the channel. Different categories of substrate characteristics, however, represent anomalies with respect to variance explained at different levels. Furthermore, local-scale controls explain 60% of variations in species richness, 59% of variations in the total number of individual trees, 68% of variation in the proportion of Platanus occidentalis basal area and 43% of variation in the total number of biogeomorphic impacts. These results are consistent with the idea of tight coupling between channel morphology and riparian vegetation, although they do not, by themselves, prove such interactions. The morphological variation of the channel at the local scale is primarily attributable to the geological controls (e.g., faults, bedding planes, joints and fractures) and incision status associated with the study area. The local scale variation in vegetation pattern can be explained by the highly local edaphic differences along the riparian corridor, which is likely to be related to the local scale fluvial process-form variations, and biogeomorphic impacts and feedbacks. These patterns may therefore be common in bedrock rivers strongly influenced by geological controls. (C) 2020 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.Show less"
22,"Danierhan, S",Oct 1 2013 ,Coupled GSI-SVAT Model with Groundwater-Surface Water Interaction in the Riparian Zone of Tarim River,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The Tarim River is located in the arid areas of northwestern China, where groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) in different landscape units have undergone regular and duplicate transformation processes, greatly improving the utilization of water resources. Investigation of the interaction between groundwater and surface water is critical to determine proper water resources planning and management in the Tarim River region. A new approach of coupling the soil-vegetation-atmosphere transport model (SVAT) with the groundwater-surface water interaction model (GSI) is presented in this paper. Usually, the surface water recharges to groundwater and groundwater-soil water exchange are not considered in the SVAT model. However, in reality, the soil water content profiles and soil heat profiles are intensely affected by shallow groundwater table, especially in arid riparian zones where groundwater levels fluctuate substantially. A new method linking the SVAT model with the GSI model is proposed in this paper to approach this issue. The groundwater-soil water exchange and groundwater evaporation can be effectively simulated using GW-SW interface in the coupled GSI-SVAT model. The coupled model is validated in the riparian zone of the upper reaches of the Tarim River with the simulation of heat and water transfer between groundwater level and soil surface, evapotranspiration, root water uptake, and groundwater-soil water exchange. The simulation results show good consistency with experimental data, indicating that the use of this coupled model could improve the accuracy of simulation of ecological water consumption in the riparian zone. The coupled GSI-SVAT model could be used for better planning and management of water resources in arid areas.Show less"
23,"Li, N",Aug 2014 ,Robust river boundaries extraction of dammed lakes in mountain areas after Wenchuan Earthquake from high resolution SAR images combining local connectivity and ACM,ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,"River boundaries extraction from SAR imagery is valuable for flood monitoring and damage assessment. Several rivers, parts of which include dammed lakes caused by landslides and rock avalanches triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, were taken as a case study for robust extraction. In this paper, a novel state-of-the-art approach for automated river boundaries extraction using high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity imagery is presented. The key of our approach lies in the combined usage of local connectivity feature of the river and a region-based active contours model (ACM) in a variational level set framework to differentiate between river and the background. First, sub-patched intensity thresholding segmentation is applied to SAR imagery. Pixels with intensities below the threshold are selected as potential river pixels while the others are potential background pixels. Second, potential river pixels are divided into several connected regions, considering that the river is a big connected region, only relatively bigger regions with similar contrast value are retained as the regions of interest (ROI) while others are noise due to pixel-level decision approach in the first step or shadows due to mountains terrain. Third, the ROI and their contours are regarded as local region and the initial contours to refine the river boundaries, which are used to reduce the scene complexity of ACM and its sensitivity to initial situation, respectively. A novel ACM driven by local image fitting (LIF) energy is presented and used for river boundaries extraction for the first time, which is not only robust against inhomogeneity widely spread in SAR imagery but also can work with efficiency without the need of re-initialization during iteration compared to traditional ACM. The proposed approach was tested on numerous high resolution airborne SAR images containing connected rivers or dammed lakes obtained by Chinese domestic radar system after Wenchuan Earthquake. For the overall dataset, the average commission error, omission error and root mean squared error were 6.5%, 3.3%, and 0.51, respectively. The average computational time for 4000 by 4000 image size was 21 min using a PC-based MATLAB platform. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust and effective.

24,"Franssen, NR",Nov 2006 ,Effects of floods on fish assemblages in an intermittent prairie stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Floods are major disturbances to stream ecosystems that can kill or displace organisms and modify habitats. Many studies have reported changes in fish assemblages after a single flood, but few studies have evaluated the importance of timing and intensity of floods on long-term fish assemblage dynamics.2. We used a 10-year dataset to evaluate the effects of floods on fishes in Kings Creek, an intermittent prairie stream in north-eastern, Kansas, U.S.A. Samples were collected seasonally at two perennial headwater sites (1995-2005) and one perennial downstream flowing site (1997-2005) allowing us to evaluate the effects of floods at different locations within a watershed. In addition, four surveys during 2003 and 2004 sampled 3-5 km of stream between the long-term study sites to evaluate the use of intermittent reaches of this stream.3. Because of higher discharge and bed scouring at the downstream site, we predicted that the fish assemblage would have lowered species richness and abundance following floods. In contrast, we expected increased species richness and abundance at headwater sites because floods increase stream connectivity and create the potential for colonisation from downstream reaches.4. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) was used to select among candidate regression models that predicted species richness and abundance based on Julian date, time since floods, season and physical habitat at each site. At the downstream site, AIC weightings suggested Julian date was the best predictor of fish assemblage structure, but no model explained > 16% of the variation in species richness or community structure. Variation explained by Julian date was primarily attributed to a long-term pattern of declining abundance of common species. At the headwater sites, there was not a single candidate model selected to predict total species abundance and assemblage structure. AIC weightings suggested variation in assemblage structure was associated with either Julian date or local habitat characteristics.5. Fishes rapidly colonised isolated or dry habitats following floods. This was evidenced by the occurrence of fishes in intermittent reaches and the positive association between maximum daily discharge and colonisation events at both headwater sites.6. Our study suggests floods allow dispersal into intermittent habitats with little or no downstream displacement of fishes. Movement of fishes among habitats during flooding highlights the importance of maintaining connectivity of stream networks of low to medium order prairie streams.Show less"

It is challenging to resolve biogeochemical mechanisms in natural riverbeds, as uncontrolled settings complicate data collection and interpretation. To overcome these challenges, laboratory flumes are often used as proxies for natural riverbed systems. Flumes capture spatiotemporal variability and thus allow for controlled investigations of riverbed biogeochemistry. These investigations implicitly rely on the assumption that the flume microbiome is similar to the microbiome of natural riverbeds. However, this assumption has not been tested and it is unknown how the microbiome of a flume compares to natural aquatic settings, including riverbeds. To evaluate the fundamental assumption that a flume hosts a microbiome similar to natural riverbed systems, we used 16s rRNA gene sequencing and publicly available data to compare the sediment microbiome of a single large laboratory flume to a wide variety of natural ecosystems including lake and marine sediments, river, lake, hyporheic, soil, and marine water, and bank and wetland soils. Richness and Shannon diversity metrics, analyses of variance, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and analysis of the common microbiomes between flume and river sediment all indicated that the flume microbiome more closely resembled natural riverbed sediments than other ecosystems, supporting the use of flume experiments for investigating natural microbially-mediated biogeochemical processes in riverbeds.Show less"

The present study first employed the grey relational analysis (GRA) to examine any existing correlations between the water quality and the structure and connectivity of river networks in the Southern Jiangsu Plain in Eastern China. All grey relational degree results were greater than the distinguishing coefficient (rho - 05), and their average value was 07551. The average grey relational degrees of the water quality parameters varied between 0.7389 and 0.7744, and those of the characteristic indicators of the river network ranged from 0.6874 to 0.8850. Seasonal variations and different land use patterns were then employed to further analyze these relationships. The average grey relational degrees in the urban, rural, and fringe regions were calculated to be 0.7231, 0.7530, and 0.7124 during the flood season, respectively, and 0.7331, 0.7432, and 0.7052 during the non-flood season. The results suggest strong correlations between the water quality and the structure and connectivity of the river network. The preponderance of the urban land weakened the original correlations more than that of the cultivated land, while the seasonal interactions of the cultivated and urban lands presented opposite. The GRA can be employed as an effective supplement for numerical modeling and statistical analysis of the incomplete data. In addition, the structure and connectivity of the river network should be taken in account to improve water quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
29,"Lazar, AA",Aug 2013 ,The power of connectivity: Identity preserving transformations on visual streams in the spike domain,NEURAL NETWORKS,"We investigate neural architectures for identity preserving transformations (IPTs) on visual stimuli in the spike domain. The stimuli are encoded with a population of spiking neurons; the resulting spikes are processed and finally decoded. A number of IPTs are demonstrated including faithful stimulus recovery, as well as simple transformations on the original visual stimulus such as translations, rotations and zoomings. We show that if the set of receptive fields satisfies certain symmetry properties, then IPTs can easily be realized and additionally, the same basic stimulus decoding algorithm can be employed to recover the transformed input stimulus. Using group theoretic methods we advance two different neural encoding architectures and discuss the realization of exact and approximate IPTs. These are realized in the spike domain processing block by a ""switching matrix"" that regulates the input/output connectivity between the stimulus encoding and decoding blocks. For example, for a particular connectivity setting of the switching matrix, the original stimulus is faithfully recovered. For other settings, translations, rotations and dilations (or combinations of these operations) of the original video stream are obtained. We evaluate our theoretical derivations through extensive simulations on natural video scenes, and discuss implications of our results on the problem of invariant object recognition in the spike domain.

30,"Blersch, SS",Jun 2019 ,Metabolic Variance: A Metric to Detect Shifts in Stream Ecosystem Function as a Result of Stream Restoration,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"The restoration of lotic ecosystems as currently practiced is constrained by a limited understanding of the emergence of stream ecosystem functions and their linkages to perceived ecosystem services valued by society. An investigation was made into the connections between ecosystem function and hydraulic structure of a stream impacted by gravel mining operations in western New York. Stream ecosystem metabolic parameters were measured using two-point dissolved oxygen diurnals on multiple reaches of the same stream, and were correlated with geomorphic and hydraulic descriptors of the same reaches. Results showed ecosystem metabolism at the reach scale varied as a function of geomorphic condition, where higher primary production and community respiration (CR) were observed for reaches observed to be unstable vs. those that were stable or restored. The metabolic variance of a stream ecosystem, proposed as a measure of the degree to which a desired ecological functional goal has been achieved post-restoration, is determined as the rate of change of the ratio of primary production to CR. Shifts in the P/R ratio were evident in reaches post-restoration, presumably as a result of changes in hydraulic structure, supporting the utility of the ratio by describing a direct link between instream hydraulic conditions and ecosystem function.Show less"
31,"Shultz, CD",May 2018 ,Simulating selenium and nitrogen fate and transport in coupled stream-aquifer systems of irrigated regions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Elevated levels of selenium (Se) in aqueous environments can harm aquatic life and endanger livestock and human health. Although Se occurs naturally in the rocks and soils of many alluvial aquifers, mining and agricultural activities can increase its rate of mobilization and transport to surface waters. Attention is given here to regions where nonpoint source return flows from irrigated lands carry pollutant loads to aquifers and streams, contributing to concentrations that violate regulatory and performance standards. Of particular concern is the heightened level and mobilization of Se influenced by nitrate (NO3), a harmful pollutant in its own right. We present a numerical model that simulates the reactive transport of Se and nitrogen (N) species in a coupled groundwater-surface water system. Building upon a conceptual model that incorporates the major processes affecting Se and NO3 transport in an irrigated watershed, the model links the finite-difference models MODFLOW, UZF-RT3D, and OTIS, to simulate flow and reactive transport of multiple chemical species in both the aquifer and a stream network, with mass exchange between the two. The capability of the new model is showcased by calibration, testing, and application to a 500 km(2) region in Colorado's Lower Arkansas River Valley using a rich data set gathered over a 10-yr period. Simulation of spatial and temporal distributions of Se concentration reveals conditions that exceed standards in groundwater for approximately 20% of the area. For the Arkansas River, standards are exceeded by 290%-450%. Simulation indicates that river concentrations of NO3 alone are near the current interim standard for the total of all dissolved N species. These results indicate the need for future use of the developed model to investigate the prospects for land and water best management practices to decrease pollutant levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

32,"Zambaldi, L",May 2020 ,Evaluation of River Fragmentation and Implications for the Conservation of Migratory Fish in Southeastern Brazil,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"In freshwater systems, the abundance and diversity of long-distance migratory fish are limited by the maintenance of longitudinal connectivity and natural flow regimes of rivers. Using a graph-based view of each riverscape, we analyzed the river fragmentation process and overlapped with the probable number of migratory species in each remaining stretch. Applying this methodology in basins, we assess historical and potential scenarios quantifying segment extensions free from dams determining the fish richness based on the available habitat for each species. The highest number of migratory species was observed in fragments longer than 100 km. In the future scenario, there was an increase in the number of fragments, with an increase in the number of stretches shorter than 50 km, inadequate to maintain most of the migratory species. Segments of the highest classification order and located in the longest lotic fragments were considered the most important for the species habitat conservation. Dam construction in these segments could seriously affect the ecological processes at a regional level. The proposed analyses enable to approach basins with high diversity of species and nonsalmonid species, supporting the lack of base data concerning those areas, and determine priorities for studies and conservation.Show less"
33,"Boso, F",Jul 2018 ,Probabilistic Forecasting of Nitrogen Dynamics in Hyporheic Zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Nitrification-denitrification processes in the hyporheic zone control the dynamics of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species and can lead to production of nitrous oxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect. We consider DIN dynamics in an advection-dominated regime, wherein transport and reactions occur along streamlines crossing hyporheic sediments. Our focus is on the impact of uncertainty in both stream water quality and rate constants of the subsurface reactions on predictions of DIN concentrations. We derive equations for a joint probability density function (PDF), and corresponding marginal PDFs and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), of the species concentrations. Their derivation requires a novel closure, which depends on the mean and (co) variance of the species concentrations. We use streamline coordinates to reduce the dimensionality of the PDF/CDF equations and, hence, the computational effort of solving them. For the sake of completeness, we also present similar equations in Cartesian coordinates. By providing a complete probabilistic description of species concentrations at the bedform scale, our PDF/CDF equations allow one to evaluate the impact of random spatiotemporal variability in the inputs on the DIN dynamics. They yield physically based prior distributions for data assimilation and can be deployed to guide measurement campaigns by identifying regions with the largest predictive uncertainty.Show less"
34,"Trigg, MA",Nov 15 2013 ,Surface water connectivity dynamics of a large scale extreme flood,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"During flood inundation, river water passes from the main channel into the floodplain through floodplain channels and diffusive overbank flow. This flood water is then distributed within the floodplain depending upon internal connections, barriers and storage, and finally returns back to the river through drainage connections. This surface water connectivity can be complex and is important to many aspects of floodplain functioning, including ecology, sediment movement and flood risk. However, there is currently no accepted way of quantifying this connectivity objectively. We quantify surface water connectivity geostatistically as an objectively measurable characteristic of an observed flood event using a time series of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface water product for an extreme large scale flood event (11,000 km(2) flooded area and 6 month duration) during 2011 in Bangkok, Thailand. We develop and apply a new gap filling method that better preserves the dynamic information of the event than simple aggregation methods. Comparison of MODIS results with the higher resolution Earth Observer 1 shows fundamental differences in the resolved connectivity with scale despite similar flooded area. The effect of the passage of the flood wave is directly observable in the river reach, as out-of-bank flooding progresses and increases connectivity along the river during rising water. Around peak flow, there is an increase in connectivity of the floodplain adjacent to the river as low lying areas fill. A step increase in connectivity is correlated with a major levee breach. During recession there is a rapid reduction in along river connectivity in the first week after the peak. This rapid reduction contrasted with a slow decrease in the floodplain connectivity as flooded depressions gradually drained reducing depth, while flood extent remained static for long periods. The connectivity analysis of the threshold in floodplain draining indicates that although spatial flood extent changes are small at this time, there is a reorganisation of the internal surface water connectivity within the flooded area. Thus through this measure of connectivity, we can see a clear structure to the event progression with new insights into flood dynamics that were not anticipated a priori. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Mixed bedrock alluvial channels are prevalent in mountain stream networks, yet the distribution and geomorphic impact of large wood within these streams are poorly understood. To estimate how the distribution of large wood in mixed bedrock-alluvial stream relates to sediment storage, we measured and characterized large wood, and we surveyed the volume of associated sediment within a stream in the Bitterroot Mountains, Montana. The upstream portion of the study reach is predominantly alluvial and the downstream portion has significant bedrock exposure along the channel bed and banks. Wood volume and sediment storage in the mixed bedrock-alluvial subreach are 50% and 15%, respectively, of those measured in the alluvial subreach. Most wood is organized into jams, and two channel-spanning jams within the upstream subreach account for 50% and 80% of the reach-averaged wood and sediment volume, respectively. The volume of sediment stored by wood in the full reach is the same order of magnitude as the estimated annual bedload export. Our study highlights the interactions among channel form and the fluxes and storage of wood and sediment. Wood that forms channel-spanning jams, which store a disproportionate amount of wood and sediment in the study reach, may accentuate differences between alluvial and bedrock-dominated subreaches in mountain stream networks, by promoting sediment deposition and storage upstream and by reducing sediment supply to downstream reaches.

This study evaluates the concentrations of PGE in stream sediments of the Hex River, which drains the mining area of the Bushveld Igneous Complex (South Africa), at four sampling points. Major, minor and trace elements (Fe, Ca, Al, Mg, Mn, V, Cr, Zn, Cu, As, Co, Ni, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed by FMS and ETAAS in suspended particulate matter and different sediment fractions (<63, 63-500 and 500-2000 mu m), and Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir were measured by ICP-MS after removal of interfering elements (cation exchange resin 50W-DOWEX-X8). Procedures were blank-corrected and accuracy checked using reference materials. Nickel, Cr, Pt, Pd, Rh and Ir show concentrations 3-, 13- 18-, 28, 48- and 44- fold the typical upper continental crust levels, respectively, although lower than concentrations reported for the parent rocks. The highest concentrations were observed closer to the mining area, decreasing with distance and in the <63 gm fraction, probably derived from atmospheric deposition and surface runoff of PGE-rich particles released from mining activities.Thus, mining activities are causing some disturbance of the surface PGE geochemical cycle, increasing the presence of PGE in the fine fraction of river sediments. We propose that indicators such as airborne particulate matter, and soil and river sediment quality, should be added to the protocols for evaluating the sustainability of mining activities.

The application of these principles is demonstrated using extensive catchment-scale analyses of geomorphic river responses to human disturbance in the Bega and Upper Hunter catchments in southeastern Australia. Differing implications for reach- and catchment-scale rehabilitation planning prompt the imperative that management practices work with nature rather than strive to 'fight the site.'.Show less"

This study applied the super efficiency slacks-based measure to calculate the regional differences and evolution characteristics of the YREB's CE from the year of 2006 to 2017. It also constructed a coupling evaluation model to empirically analyze the interactions between CE and technology absorptive capacity (TAC).

TAC generally increased and incrementally decreased in the sequence of the upper stream, middle stream, and downstream. The gap among the downstream, upper stream, and middle stream increased; (2) coupling between the CE and TAC for the YREB provinces can be characterized as a relatively stable medium to low coupling degree and medium-to-high coordination degree. To improve coupling and achieve balanced, sustainable development in the YREB, this study proposes several measures, including promoting balanced, high-quality economic development, building the YREB talent pool, appropriately guiding foreign capital flows, implementing the strategy of driving economic development through innovation, and launching the network for coordinated technological innovation in YREB.Show less"

The Qingshui River Basin (QRB), as the main sediment source tributary of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, is characterized by spatial heterogeneity of rainfall, vegetation, and soil erosion. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of sediment yields within the QRB and further identified the coupling effects of precipitation and vegetation on soil erosion. We collected annual (1955 to 2016) and daily (2006 to 2016) hydrological and sediment series from six hydrological stations, which subdivided the whole basin into six different sub-basins with heterogeneity in climate and landscape. Variations in parameter a of the sediment rating curves among the six sub-basins continuously declined, showing the continuously increasing effect of vegetation coverage on reducing soil erosion. The unique combination of relationships between precipitation characteristics and vegetation patterns in six sub-basins and these coupling effects resulted in different precipitation-vegetation-erosion patterns in six sub-basins. Sediment yield followed bell-shaped relationships with vegetation and precipitation, with a clear critical threshold at normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) = 0.36/precipitation = 100 mm at a monthly scale. Based on these thresholds, the non-linear relationships between precipitation, vegetation, and erosion were also explained. We also found that reducing the time lags in which vegetation follows precipitation may be effective in suppressing sediment yield. These findings could provide a quantitative approach to estimating the potential changes in sediment yield associated with proposed ecological rehabilitation schemes in this region.Show less"

Concerning measurements, two measuring techniques (discharge difference measurements and seepage meter measurements) are investigated. Discharge difference measurements can give reliable results if the length of the reach, at the ends of which the discharge is measured, is appropriate. Infiltrometer measurements are of questionable value when influenced by difficult to detect installation errors. Concerning calculations the following issues are addressed:(a) The sensitivity of the calculated values of the exchange rate to errors in various parameters. This problem is discussed by means of analytical solutions; The analysis shows that, in case of stream beds with relatively small hydraulic resistance, errors in the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer are important for the exchange rate. In case of stream beds with high hydraulic resistance, exchange rate is strongly influenced by the errors in the hydraulic resistance. In such cases, errors in the parameters characterizing the capillary forces in the porous media can increase the resulting errors considerably.(b) The reliability of estimations of the hydraulic resistance of the stream bed by means of piezometric head measurements near the stream. Investigations in a small stream show that, if the hydraulic resistance of the stream bed is high, its estimation from measurements of the piezometric heads is uncertain.(c) The forecasting of the exchange rate by means of depth integrated models under a hydrologic regime other than the one used for calibration. By means of analytical solutions it is shown that in case of stream beds with high hydraulic resistance and for porous materials in which the capillary forces are negligible, the exchange coefficient used to describe the exchange flow includes only the influence of the clogging layer. In such cases the value of the exchange coefficient estimated from the calibration can be used to forecast the exchange rate under changed hydrological conditions. In cases where the hydraulic resistance of the stream bed is small and for materials with nonnegligible capillary forces, such forecasting can be erroneous.Show less"

The aim of our study was to explore the near-natural river dynamics comparing with the current conditions and to examine its sustainability. The river landscape system in near-natural circumstances was highly related to the predictable fluvial disturbances, which sustained both the lateral and the vertical connectivity of the river branch system. During floods the main channel was able to refresh the habitats of the side-arms and the backwaters. The ebb and flow of the river was unhindered through channels, which were established to lead away the floods rolling back the level of it, and to collect the residual waters of the ebb.

The coupled model, SWAT_FEM was applied to assess the hydrology of the Chennai River basin in India, a coastal zone with significant irrigation. The SWAT_FEM enhanced the predictions of stream flows and ground water levels (R-2:0.69,0.81; Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE):0.64,0.74) compared to the standalone model, SWAT (R-2:0.64,0.66; NSE:0.60,0.63) respectively. The coupled model produced an all-inclusive representation of the impacts of management practices on the hydrological processes and generated insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of the surface water and ground water interactions in the study area. The results showed that the interactions of surface water and ground water were significant in the mainstream of Chennai River basin.

The results emphasized that if the ground water demand continued to increase, accelerated and unregulated ground water extraction is bound to happen shortly to suffice the water use, which can bring about environmental problems to this basin. Overall, this study demonstrated the applicability of the SWAT_FEM model and its value to the water resources management in irrigated areas with management practices. The developed model can be utilized in water resources assessment tools for effective predictions of ground water contributions in river basins.Show less"

Study focus: A year-long field campaign from July 2018 to July 2019 measured steady and dynamic stream-aquifer exchanges on Ichawaynochaway Creek (INC), a fifth-order tributary to the karstic Flint River in Georgia. The net change in discharge along a 24-km Creek segment was determined between two US Geological Survey gaging stations with no surface-water inflows. Stream-aquifer interactions were measured along a 120-m piezometer transect perpendicular to the bank. Hydraulic parameters to aid future modeling efforts were estimated using the method of moments applied to changes in bank flow direction from Hurricane Michael. New hydrological insights for the region: Results display the effects of local water use on streamflow as most channel storage gains occurred in the fall and winter. Negligible net channel gains and some losses occurred during the spring and summer months. Approximately 150 million m3 of net channel gains were observed during the study period. Initial stormflow contributed to aquifer recharge as indicated by reversals in the hydraulic gradient. Diffusivity and transmissivity increased along the transect (9-420 m(2)/d) and (3-150 m(2)/d), respectively, and hydraulic conductivity equaled 2.85 m/d. Stream-reach orientation with respect to regional groundwater gradients explains increased stream-aquifer interactions. Surface-groundwater interactions in karst systems are better understood after characterizing variation of hydraulic processes.Show less"
