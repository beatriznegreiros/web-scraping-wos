0,"Magliozzi, C",Nov 30 2018 ,Toward a conceptual framework of hyporheic exchange across spatial scales,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Rivers are not isolated systems but interact continuously with groundwater from their confined headwaters to their wide lowland floodplains. In the last few decades, research on the hyporheic zone (HZ) has increased appreciation of the hydrological importance and ecological significance of connected river and groundwater systems. While recent studies have investigated hydrological, biogeochemical and ecohydrological processes in the HZ at bedform and reach scales, a comprehensive understanding of process-based interactions between factors operating at different spatial and temporal scales driving hyporheic exchange flows (HEFs) at reach scale and larger is still missing. Therefore, this review summarizes the factors and processes at catchment, valley, and reach scales that interact to control spatial and temporal variations in hyporheic exchange flows. By using a multi-scale perspective, this review connects field observations and modelling studies to identify the process driving patterns and dynamics of HEF. Finally, the influence of process interactions over multiple spatial scales is illustrated in a case study, supported by new GIS analyses, which highlights the importance of valley-scale factors to the expression of HEF at the reach scale. This conceptual framework will aid the development of approaches to interpret hyporheic exchange across scales, infer scaling relationships, and inform catchment management decisions.Show less"
1,"Jaeger, KL",Dec 2012 ,ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE SENSOR ARRAYS AS A MEANS TO QUANTIFY LONGITUDINAL CONNECTIVITY OF RIVERS,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Electrical resistance sensors are used as a novel approach to quantify streamflow continuity (continuous through time) and longitudinal connectivity (continuous through space) across watersheds in south-eastern Arizona, USA. We demonstrate this approach by reporting on a spatial array of 21 sensors installed in streams supporting naturally perennial, intermittent and ephemeral flow on the US Army Garrison, Fort Huachuca. Continuity and connectivity were quantified based on a strict interpretation of continuous flow at an individual sensor (strict continuity) or simultaneous streamflow at multiple sensors (strict connectivity). In addition, we evaluated continuity and connectivity to include periods (<48?h) when in-channel refuges may exist between streamflow events (refuge-maintained continuity and connectivity). Continuous streamflow in intermittent reaches accounted for 34% of the 121-day monitoring period (15 April13 August 2010) and 28% of the summer monsoon period (1 July13 August 2010). Streamflow in ephemeral reaches accounted for 1.5% and 2.3% of the entire monitoring and monsoon period, respectively. Canyon-wide longitudinal connectivity was rare (<1%); however, substantial longitudinal connection occurred along extensive portions of individual canyons. The refuge-maintained criteria increased continuity 28%, with less influence on connectivity (e.g. <3% increase in only some portions of canyons). Despite this result, the refuge-maintained concept remains important because of its broad applicability to refuge persistence across aquatic species and hydro-climatic regimes. The approach presented in this study supports the growing scientific research on the influence of longitudinal hydrologic connectivity on population dynamics and ecological processes in dendritic river networks.

2,"Fortner, SK",Jan 30 2013 ,"Diel stream geochemistry, Taylor Valley, Antarctica",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Unlike temperate and polythermal proglacial streams, the proglacial streams in Taylor Valley ( TV), Antarctica, are derived primarily from glacier surface melt with no subglacial or groundwater additions. Solute responses to flow reflect only the interaction of glacial meltwater with the valley floor surrounding the stream channel. We have investigated the major, minor and trace element 24-h variations of two proglacial melt streams, Andersen Creek and Canada Stream, originating from the Canada Glacier in TV, Antarctica. Both streams exhibited diel mid-austral summer diurnal flow variation, with maximum flow being more than 50 times the minimum flow. Dissolved (< 0.4 mu m) major, minor and trace solute behaviors through diel periods were strongly controlled by the availability of readily solubilized material on the valley floor and hyporheic-biological exchanges. Anderson Creek had generally greater solute concentrations than Canada Stream because of its greater receipt of eolian sediment. Andersen Creek also acquired greater solute concentrations in the rising limb of the hydrograph than the falling limb because of dissolution of eolian material at the surface of the stream channel coupled with minimal hyporheic-biological exchange. Conversely, Canada Stream had less available eolian sediment, but a greater hyporheic-biological exchange, which preferentially removed trace and major solutes in the rising limb and released them in the falling limb. Given the dynamic nature of discharge, eolian, and hyporheic-biological processes, solute loads in TV streams are difficult to predict. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
3,"Datry, T",2008 ,Lateral and longitudinal patterns within the stygoscape of an alluvial river corridor,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"In landscape ecology, landscapes are viewed as hierarchically-organized groups of interacting components or zones. This perspective is applied in studies of riverscapes with increasing frequency, particularly ill Studies of channel habitats and channel-floodplain interactions. Stygoscapes, the subsurface portions of riverscapes, have received less attention. Stygoscapes are composed of three saturated zones beneath and lateral to river channels: the hyporheic, parafluvial and riparian zones. These zones are differentiated oil the basis of hydrological, biological and chemical conditions, and the degree of interaction with the channel surface. In this paper, we describe lateral and longitudinal patterns in the shallow (30 cm - 10 m depth) stygoscape of the alluvial Selwyn River, New Zealand. We used abutting hyporheic, parafluvial and riparian zones in large-scale downwelling (losing) and upwelling (gaining) sections of the river mainstem to compare physico-chemical and biological conditions across a broad stygoscape. The stygoscape zones had the same arrangement in both sections: hyporheic zones within the wetted channel, riparian zones furthest front the channel, and parafluvial zones between the hyporheic and riparian zones. Nitrate and dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations and electrical conductivity were significantly higher, and dissolved organic phosphorus concentrations and pH levels lower, in the gaining section than the losing section. In both Sections, ammonium, dissolved reactive phosphorus, and dissolved organic cat-boil concentrations and pH were higher in the hyporheic zone than the riparian zone. Within the losing section, DON and DOP concentrations were higher in the hyporheic zone than the riparian zone. Physico-chemical conditions were intermediate in the parafluvial zones of both river sections. These among-zone differences Suggest that hyporheic zones are sinks for dissolved nutrients, and that effects of hyporheic sinks are greatest in losing river sections with unidirectional flow front the surface to the hyporheic zone. There were large differences among stygoscape zones in invertebrate assemblage composition, and smaller differences between the losing and gaining sections. Invertebrate densities, taxon richness and % insect taxa were higher in hyporheic zones than riparian zones. Invertebrate densities were intermediate in the parafluvial zones, and taxon richness and % insect taxa were similar in parafluvial and riparian zones. The spatial patterns we observed in the Selwyn River suggest that hydrological connectivity between zones, and permeability within zones, are among the most important determinants of chemical and biological dynamics in stygoscapes. Differences in large-scale upwelling and downwelling, and differences in water Source (runoff and groundwater) appeared to be of secondary importance.Show less"
4,"Heathwaite, AL",Apr 2021 ,Spatial and temporal dynamics of nitrogen exchange in an upwelling reach of a groundwater-fed river and potential response to perturbations changing rainfall patterns under UK climate change scenarios,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"We report the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange flows (HEFs) and nitrogen exchange in an upwelling reach of a 200 m groundwater-fed river. We show how research combining hydrological measurement, geophysics and isotopes, together with nutrient speciation techniques provides insight on nitrogen pathways and transformations that could not have been captured otherwise, including a zone of vertical preferential discharge of nitrate from deeper groundwater, and a zone of rapid denitrification linking the floodplain with the riverbed. Nitrate attenuation in the reach is dominated by denitrification but is spatially highly variable. This variability is driven by groundwater flow pathways and landscape setting, which influences hyporheic flow, residence time and nitrate removal. We observed the spatial connectivity of the river to the riparian zone is important because zones of horizontal preferential discharge supply organic matter from the floodplain and create anoxic riverbed conditions with overlapping zones of nitrification potential and denitrification activity that peaked 10-20 cm below the riverbed. Our data also show that temporal variability in water pathways in the reach is driven by changes in stage of the order of tens of centimetres and by strength of water flux, which may influence the depth of delivery of dissolved organic carbon. The temporal variability is sensitive to changes to river flows under UK climate projections that anticipate a 14%-15% increase in regional median winter rainfall and a 14%-19% reduction in summer rainfall. Superimposed on seasonal projections is more intensive storm activity that will likely lead to a more dynamic and inherently complex (hydrologically and biogeochemically) hyporheic zone. We recorded direct evidence of suppression of upwelling groundwater (flow reversal) during rainfall events. Such flow reversal may fuel riverbed sediments whereby delivery of organic carbon to depth, and higher denitrification rates in HEFs might act in concert to make nitrate removal in the riverbed more efficient.Show less"
5,"Chi, SY",Aug 1 2018 ,Distribution patterns of macroinvertebrate communities in a Chinese floodgate-regulated river and their relationships with river longitudinal connectivity,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"In this study, the Li River and the middle-lower reaches of the Shaying River in the Shaying River basin were selected for an investigation on the effects of floodgates on macroinvertebrate communities; additionally, the relationships among floodgates, macroinvertebrate communities and river longitudinal connectivity were explored. The Li and Shaying rivers had similar ratios of molluscs and saapers, but their species compositions were significantly different. The water level fluctuations in the Li River were based on natural hydrological characteristics, and these were very different from the fluctuations in the reaches of the Shaying River that were divided by a serious of floodgates. The effects of floodgates resulted in a reduction in the number of taxa, Shannon-Wiener index, Margalef index, and Fisher index and an increase in the Harrison index. The upper reaches of the Li and Saying rivers had similar macroinvertebrate communities, but these were very different from the lower reaches of the Saying River. The total number of species and the number of aquatic insect species increased with the river connectivity gradient and the variations in the alpha-diversity and beta-diversity indices along reaches confirmed the hypothesis that the longitudinal connectivity of the Shaying River was significantly affected by floodgates. The results of Pearson and PLS tests showed that some plankton variables and physical water parameters could possibly describe how the gradient of river longitudinal connectivity was related to the floodgates in the Shaying River basin. The results of partial correlations showed, even when excluding the effects of water pollution, the protozoa richness and electrical conductivity still had significant influences on the distribution patterns of macroinvertebrate communities. When considering the results of correlation analyses and regression together, these same variables could be used to describe how the gradient of river longitudinal hydrological connectivity is related to floodgates in future studies.

6,"Jiang, QH",Aug 2020 ,Density-dependent solute transport in a layered hyporheic zone,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Hyporheic exchange is affected by bedform geometry, which induces complex flow paths within the bedform. Additional factors that influence flow and solute transport in the hyporheic zone are layered profile sediments and density-driven flow. This study explored the combined effects of these factors on hyporheic exchange through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations involving infiltrating solute displacing less-dense resident water in a layered bedform with a low permeability layer (LPL). The bedform consisted of three horizontal layers, in which the hydraulic conductivity of the middle layer (LPL) was less than that of the top (TL) and bottom layers (BL). The results demonstrated that a previously unexplored combination of mechanisms (density effects and layered bedform) produces irregular spatial patterns of solute transport in the hyporheic zone. For instance, the width of solute plume within the bottom layers becomes narrowed compared with tracer transport. With increasing density contrast between infiltrating solute and resident water, the solute plume becomes much narrower, forming fingers. Numerical modeling further shows that the hydraulic conductivity contrast (HCC) and relative thickness (RT) of the hyporheic zone layers also affect the spatial solute transport patterns. As the hydraulic conductivity contrast or relative thickness increases, the plume becomes much narrower. Horizontal ambient flow (HAF) dominated in the bottom layers, and lateral solute spreading and mixing intensified with a higher hydraulic conductivity contrast and relative thickness. Furthermore, the vertical solute plume was detached by the horizontal ambient flow in the bottom layers with a discontinuous low permeability layer, forming a discontinuous zone of vertical solute transport.Show less"
7,"Constantz, J",Apr 2013 ,Streambed exchanges along tributary streams in humid watersheds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Tributary streams flow from the headwaters directly to the main stem in the valley axis and represent an important general stream type with high surface areas to volume and high streambed exchanges along much of their length. These characteristics strongly influence water quantity and quality in tributary streams, as well as the underlying groundwater and, eventually, the main stem. Tributary streams can be described as consisting of upland, central, and distal reaches, each with temporal trends in streambed exchanges unique to their spatial position along the tributary stream. In this work, thermal tracing and hydraulic monitoring reported in earlier works have been analyzed to compare surface-water/groundwater streambed exchange patterns along Fish Creek Wyoming (US), a well-studied tributary stream in a humid watershed. Results of this analysis demonstrate that composite thermal/hydraulic techniques successfully differentiated reach-specific streambed exchanges to distinguish upland, central, and distal reaches along Fish Creek above the Snake River. The upland and central reaches streambed exchanges were primarily vertical and horizontal streambed exchanges normal to general streamflow, while the distal reach streambed exchanges were lower in magnitude and more longitudinal in the same direction as streamflow. Heat-based streambed hydraulic conductivities were highest (and isotropic) for the upland reach and lowest (and strongly anisotropic) for the distal reach, in accordance with general downstream sediment fining approaching a main stem. These distinct reach patterns should show general transfer value, since general tributary streambed exchange patterns are expected to be influenced by proximity to headwaters in the upland reach, by buffering within alluvial fill in the central reach, and by proximity to the main stem in the distal reach.Show less"
8,"Song, JX",Sep 2010 ,Observation of bioturbation and hyporheic flux in streambeds,FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING IN CHINA,"In the Elkhorn River, burrows, tubes, and sediment mounds created by invertebrate bioturbation were observed in the exposed streambed and commonly concentrated on the fine-sediment patches, which consist of silt, clay, and organic matter. These invertebrate activities could loosen the thin layer of clogging sediments and result in an increase of pore size in the sediments, leading to greater vertical hydraulic conductivity of the streambed (K (v) ). The measurements of the vertical hydraulic gradient across the submerged streambed show that vertical flux in the hyporheic zone can alter directions (upward versus downward) for two locations only a few meters apart. In situ permeameter tests show that streambed K (v) in the upper sediment layer is much higher than that in the lower sediment layer, and the calculated K (v) in the submerged streambed is consistently greater than that in the clogged sediments around the shorelines of the sand bars. Moreover, a phenomenon of gas bubble release at the water-sediment interface from the subsurface sediments was observed in the groundwater seepage zone where flow velocity is extremely small. The bursting of gas bubbles can potentially break the thin clogging layer of sediments and enhance the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the streambed.Show less"
9,"Byrne, P",Mar 15 2015 ,Diffusive equilibrium in thin films provides evidence of suppression of hyporheic exchange and large-scale nitrate transformation in a groundwater-fed river,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The hyporheic zone of riverbed sediments has the potential to attenuate nitrate from upwelling, polluted groundwater. However, the coarse-scale (5-10cm) measurement of nitrogen biogeochemistry in the hyporheic zone can often mask fine-scale (<1cm) biogeochemical patterns, especially in near-surface sediments, leading to incomplete or inaccurate representation of the capacity of the hyporheic zone to transform upwelling NO3-. In this study, we utilised diffusive equilibrium in thin-films samplers to capture high resolution (cm-scale) vertical concentration profiles of NO3-, SO42-, Fe and Mn in the upper 15cm of armoured and permeable riverbed sediments. The goal was to test whether nitrate attenuation was occurring in a sub-reach characterised by strong vertical (upwelling) water fluxes. The vertical concentration profiles obtained from diffusive equilibrium in thin-films samplers indicate considerable cm-scale variability in NO3- (4.4 +/- 2.9mg N/L), SO42- (9.9 +/- 3.1mg/l) and dissolved Fe (1.6 +/- 2.1mg/l) and Mn (0.2 +/- 0.2mg/l). However, the overall trend suggests the absence of substantial net chemical transformations and surface-subsurface water mixing in the shallow sediments of our sub-reach under baseflow conditions. The significance of this is that upwelling NO3--rich groundwater does not appear to be attenuated in the riverbed sediments at <15cm depth as might occur where hyporheic exchange flows deliver organic matter to the sediments for metabolic processes. It would appear that the chemical patterns observed in the shallow sediments of our sub-reach are not controlled exclusively by redox processes and/or hyporheic exchange flows. Deeper-seated groundwater fluxes and hydro-stratigraphy may be additional important drivers of chemical patterns in the shallow sediments of our study sub-reach. (c) 2015 The Authors.

10,"Jin, GQ",Nov 2018 ,Density effects on nanoparticle transport in the hyporheic zone,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"A carbon solution composed of nanoparticles (d(50) = 85.7 nm) was used in experiments designed to explore nanoparticle transport characteristics within the hyporheic zone of a riverbed. Experiments and numerical simulations demonstrated that nanoparticle transport in the hyporheic zone is affected by hydraulic head gradients due to river flow-bedform interactions as well as density gradients associated with the nano-carbon solution. Differences with similar flow/transport situations were examined, and it was found that particulate-enhanced density can change hyporheic transport appreciably. In addition to density, particle settling enhances downward movement of the nano-carbon plume in the riverbed. While nanoparticle transport in the upper hyporheic zone is largely controlled by advection due to flow driven by head gradients at the bed surface, density gradients and particle settling influence the transport process significantly in the lower hyporheic zone. During the transport process, nanoparticles become deposited due to attachment to sand particles and filtration by small pores in the bed. Compared with transport where density variations are minimal, the particulate-induced density gradient induces downward transport of nanoparticles and entrained liquids, leading to deposition/accumulation at the base of the bed.Show less"
11,"Singh, T",Aug 2020 ,Effects of Successive Peak Flow Events on Hyporheic Exchange and Residence Times,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange is a crucial control of the type and rates of streambed biogeochemical processes, including metabolism, respiration, nutrient turnover, and the transformation of pollutants. Previous work has shown that increasing discharge during an individual peak flow event strengthens biogeochemical turnover by enhancing the exchange of water and dissolved solutes. However, due to the nonsteady nature of the exchange process, successive peak flow events do not exhibit proportional variations in residence time and turnover, and in some cases, can reduce the hyporheic zones' biogeochemical potential. Here, we used a process-based model to explore the role of successive peak flow events on the flow and transport characteristics of bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. We conducted a systematic analysis of the impacts of the events' magnitude, duration, and time between peaks in the hyporheic zone's fluxes, penetration, and residence times. The relative contribution of each event to the transport of solutes across the sediment-water interface was inferred from transport simulations of a conservative solute. In addition to temporal variations in the hyporheic flow field, our results demonstrate that the separation between two events determines the temporal evolution of residence time and that event time lags longer than the memory of the system result in successive events that can be treated independently. This study highlights the importance of discharge variability in the dynamics of hyporheic exchange and its potential implications for biogeochemical transformations and fate of contaminants along river corridors.Show less"
12,"Graillot, D",Feb 5 2014 ,Coupling groundwater modeling and biological indicators for identifying river/aquifer exchanges,SPRINGERPLUS,"Future climate changes and the resulting modifications in anthropogenic activities will alter the interactions between rivers and groundwater. The quantification of these hydraulic interactions is absolutely necessary for achieving sustainable water use and requires accurate analytical methodologies. This report proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the quantitative and qualitative characterization of hydraulic interactions between rivers and shallow aquifers, wherein it outlines the advantages of coupling groundwater modeling with biological markers. As a first step, we built independent diagnostic maps of hydrological exchanges at the sector scale on the basis of hydrogeological modeling and biological indicators. In a second step, these maps were compared to provide a quantitative and qualitative understanding of exchanges between groundwater and surface water. This comparison significantly improved the calibration of groundwater models through a better assessment of boundary zones. Our approach enabled us to identify the conditions under which it could be possible to use biological indicators instead of a large set of piezometric measures. The integration of such combined tools in a future decision support system will assist governmental authorities in proposing appropriate long-term water policies for the preservation of groundwater resources, such as for supplying potable water and/or mitigating pollution risks.Show less"
13,"Zhang, PP",Jun 2020 ,"Water exchange in a large river-lake system: Modeling, characteristics and causes",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"River-lake water exchange reflects hydrological connectivity and the dynamic relationship between the river and the lake. The water exchange is crucial for lake level variation, downstream river discharge and the ecosystem. To figure out the water exchange between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake, a data-driven model was established based on the support vector regression and genetic algorithm technique. Nine scenarios were set with different river-lake hydrological conditions, divided into two categories: single-element change scenarios, where only the river conditions or only the lake conditions changed, and combined scenarios, where both elements changed simultaneously. The model could accurately simulate the river-lake water exchange variations. Scenario simulation results show that increasing the river flow or lowering the lake level could cause a decrease in the lake outflow. Conversely, decreasing river flow or raising the lake level could cause an increase in lake outflow. Changing lake conditions have a stronger impact on the water exchange variation than changing river conditions if the change percentages of the situation indicator values are the same. Similarly, lake level increase has a stronger impact on the water exchange variation than lake level decrease. The combined scenarios indicate the additive effect of the corresponding single-element change scenarios, with a clear linear relationship between their lake outflow changes. This study provides an efficient model for simulating complex hydrological flow relationships in river-lake systems, and supports the management of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake by providing the characteristics and causes of the river-lake water exchange.Show less"
14,"Rehg, KJ",Feb 15 2005 ,Effects of suspended sediment characteristics and bed sediment transport on streambed clogging,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Fine sediment deposition in streambeds can reduce pore water fluxes and the overall rate of hyporbeic exchange, producing deleterious effects on benthic and hyporheic ecological communities. To increase understanding of the factors that control the reduction of hyporheic exchange by fine sediment deposition, we conducted experiments in a laboratory flume to observe changes in the rates of solute exchange and kaolinite clay deposition as substantial amounts of kaolinite accumulated in the streambed. Two long-term experiments were conducted, with durations of 14 days and 29 days. Use of a laboratory flume system allowed steady stream flow conditions to be maintained throughout both experiments, and alternating injections of known quantities of kaolinite and a sodium chloride tracer were used to assess the effect of clay accumulation on hyporheic exchange directly. In the first experiment, there was no bed sediment transport and kaolinite deposition formed a highly clogged near-surface layer that greatly reduced hyporheic exchange. Application of a fundamental model for advective hyporheic exchange indicated that the effective permeability and porosity of the streambed decreased substantially during the course of the experiment. In the second experiment, the kaolinite was prepared with different surface properties to be more mobile, and the experiment was conducted with a small degree of bed sediment transport. As a result, no distinct clogged layer developed, and the rate of hyporheic exchange was found to remain approximately constant throughout the experiment (29 days). These results indicate that increasing fine sediment loads, e.g. those that occur from changes in land use, can have substantially different impacts on hyporheic exchange and associated ecological processes depending on the stream flow conditions, the rate and frequency of bed sediment transport, and the extent of interaction of the introduced fines with bed sediments.

15,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",Jan 2014 ,Assessing invertebrate assemblages in the subsurface zone of stream sediments ( 0-15 cm deep) using a hyporheic sampler,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Quantitative comparisons between benthic and hyporheic invertebrate communities are crucial for understanding the biological functions of the hyporheic zone, such as storage, migrations, and exchanges of invertebrates with the surface stream. Such comparisons are still hampered by the use of different techniques adapted to each habitat (benthic versus hyporheic). This work combines two different techniques for sampling the upper layers of bed sediments (0-15 cm): the semiquantitative Bou-Rouch pump classically used to sample the hyporheic zone (>15 cm), and the quantitative Hess sampler commonly used to sample the benthic zone (15 cm), in order to evaluate the quantitative efficiency of the pump in this 0-15 cm zone. First, a Bou-Rouch sample (BR) was taken within the cylinder of a Hess inserted within the streambed, then a second sample (benthic complement, BC) was collected within the Hess after removing the pump, in order to catch all invertebrates not extracted with the pump. The BR samples collected on average 14.5% of the total abundance and about 50% of the actual richness. The large range of variation indicates that the combination of the two techniques is not valid for a quantitative evaluation of benthic communities. Contrary to expectations, the pump did not collect more interstitial and groundwater invertebrates and no differences in faunal composition between upstream and downstream riffle positions were observed. Our results do not question the use of the BR technique under standard conditions i.e., when sampling the hyporheic zone, but underline how it is crucial to know its quantitative limits.Show less"
16,"Gooseff, MN",Sep-dec 2004 ,Reach-scale cation exchange controls on major ion chemistry of an Antarctic glacial meltwater stream,AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY,"The McMurdo dry valleys of Antarctica represent the largest of the ice-free areas on the Antarctic continent, containing glaciers, meltwater streams, and closed basin lakes. Previous geochemical studies of dry valley streams and lakes have addressed chemical weathering reactions of hyporheic substrate and geochemical evolution of dry valley surface waters. We examine cation transport and exchange reactions during a stream tracer experiment in a dry valley glacial meltwater stream. The injection solution was composed of dissolved Li+, Na+, K+, and Cl-. Chloride behaved conservatively in this stream, but Li+, Na+, and K+ were reactive to varying degrees. Mass balance analysis indicates that relative to Cl-, Li+ and K+ were taken up in downstream transport and Na+ was released. Simulations of conservative and reactive (first-order uptake or generation) solute transport were made with the OTIS (one-dimensional solute transport with inflow and storage) model. Among the four experimental reaches of Green Creek, solute transport simulations reveal that Li+ was removed from stream water in all four reaches, K+ was released in two reaches, taken up in one reach, and Na+ was released in all four reaches. Hyporheic sediments appear to be variable with uptake of Li+ in two reaches, uptake of K+ in one reach, release of K+ in two reaches, and uptake of Na+ in one reach. Mass balances of the conservative and reactive simulations show that from 1.05 to 2.19 moles of Li+ was adsorbed per reach, but less than 0.3 moles of K+ and less than 0.9 moles of Na+ were released per reach. This suggests that either ( 1) exchange of another ion which was not analyzed in this experiment or ( 2) that both ion exchange and sorption control inorganic solute transport. The elevated cation concentrations introduced during the experiment are typical of initial flows in each flow season, which flush accumulated dry salts from the streambed. We propose that the bed sediments ( which compose the hyporheic zone) modulate the flushing of these salts during initial flows each season, due to ion exchange and sorption reactions.Show less"

They comprise key elements of wetland and aquatic habitats and have important influence on the storage and routing of floodwaters. The hydrological connectivity between active river channels and floodplain depressions varies considerably in a qualitative sense, even within a single fluvial system. Several oxbows, sloughs and paleochannels were examined on the lower Sabine River, Texas/Louisiana, during a period of high but sub-bankfull flow as well as at lower flows. Six different types of surface water connectivity with the main, active channel were identified: (i) flow througha portion of the river flow regularly passes through the feature and returns to the main channel; (ii) flood channelthere is no hydraulic connection at normal flows, but at high flows the channels convey discharge, at least part of which returns to the main channel; (iii) fill and spillthe features fill to a threshold level at high flows and then overflow (mainly via ephemeral channels) into flood basins; (iv) fill and drainthe features fill at high river discharges but do not (except in large floods) overflow because as river discharge declines, water drains back to the river; (v) tributary occupiedtributaries draining to the abandoned channel continue to occupy it, flowing through it to the active channel; and (vi) disconnectedno flow is exchanged except during large floods. The age or stage of infilling and the relative elevation of abandoned channels are important first-order controls of hydrological connectivity, but the lateral distance from the active channel is poorly related. Other critical controls are whether the cutoff section receives tributary input and whether a tie channel forms. The alluvial valley geomorphic contextspecifically the presence of a meander belt ridge and flood basinsis also critical. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
20,"Hester, ET",Dec 2021 ,Hyporheic transverse mixing zones and dispersivity: Laboratory and numerical experiments of hydraulic controls,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,"Mixing of surface water and groundwater in shallow sediments is important to biogeochemical cycling and contaminant migration, and is often used to define the hyporheic zone. Yet knowledge of mixing processes in hyporheic zones is supported by surprisingly few rigorous lab or field observations, and differ from those in deeper groundwater by presence of enhanced head gradients, sediment heterogeneity, and temporal fluctuations. In a laboratory sediment (sand) tank we photographed a conservative dye to analyze transverse mixing zones between upwelling groundwater and bidirectional hyporheic exchange flows. We then conducted numerical modeling to investigate processes behind observed phenomena and estimate dispersivities. We found that transverse mixing zones were thin (i.e. mixing thickness measured in direction of steepest concentration gradient, delta, less than 5 cm), consistent with a small calibrated transverse dispersivity (similar to 0.1 mm) and prior lab studies conducted at similar scales. In steady-state experiments and simulations, delta and estimated dispersion coefficients increased with the surface water head drop driving exchange flows. Given relatively constant deeper groundwater heads, increased Delta h led to increased mixing zone length for both steady-state and transient conditions, indicating larger bedforms or weaker gaining conditions enhance subsurface mixing. However, Peclet number and flux-related dilution index simultaneously increased and decreased, respectively, indicating that enhancement of subsurface advection outpaced that of dispersion. In transient experiments and simulations, delta was greater than for steady-state, probably from temporary addition of longitudinal dispersion. During transient experiments, delta exhibited temporal noise, perhaps due to the mixing zone moving past varying patterns of sediment packing. Our results provide basic knowledge of mixing zone behavior in hyporheic zones with implications for hyporheic zone definitions, solute transport, mixing-dependent reaction, and water quality.Show less"

Although network approaches have been proposed for studying connectivity and transport properties on single-layer networks, theories considering interacting networks are lacking. We present a general framework for transport on multiscale coupled-connectivity systems, via multilayer networks which conceptualize the system as a set of interacting networks, each arranged in a separate layer, and with interactions across layers acknowledged by interlayer links. We illustrate this framework by examining transport in river deltas as a dynamic interaction of flow within river channels and overland flow on the islands, when controlled by the flooding level. We show the potential of the framework to answer quantitative questions related to the characteristic timescale of response in the system.Plain Language Summary The physical processes that shape landscapes leave behind patterns of connectivity along which fluxes occur via a multitude of processes, for example, flow through channels, subsurface or overland flow. The connectivity imposed by those processes (e.g., channel networks) exerts a significant control on the evolution and form of the underlying systems. We introduce a framework based on coupled networks, Multiplex, that allows to quantify the connectivity properties emerging from the simultaneous action of different processes, enabling thus to assess the overall system properties and dynamics. We illustrate this framework by examining the case of river deltas, where intermittent flooding and exchange of water, sediment, and nutrients between the channels and the islands maintains the delta top by trapping sediment, stabilizing banks, and enriching rivers with carbon and nutrients. By describing the delta system as a Multiplex-integrating the connectivity imposed by confined (in the channel network) and overland (on the islands) flows as well as the interactions (flux exchange) between them-we show the emergence of system transport properties and dynamics not foreseen by analyzing each process separately, and therefore revealing key information essential to predict the system response under changing forcing.Show less"
23,"Fruetel, C",May 2019 ,A laboratory method for the visualization and quantification of hyporheic flow paths and velocities,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,"Hyporheic flow, the flow of water through the permeable material immediately surrounding a river, is important for nutrient cycling, dissolved oxygen transport, and contaminant transport. In addition, there is recent concern regarding the role of hyporheic flow on the contamination of rivers following oil spills. To better understand hyporheic flow paths and velocities, it is important to measure hyporheic flow at high spatial and temporal resolution. A practical method to measure hyporheic flow in a laboratory flume based on dye injection, digital images, and moment analysis was developed. An experiment conducted using a single gravel bar demonstrated good agreement between observations and estimates based on image processing. The measured hyporheic flow field showed upstream and downstream flow that discharged downstream of the bar top, the presence of a flow divide and flow stagnation, and hyporheic flow velocities indicative of turbulent flow for which Darcy's law is not applicable.Show less"
24,"Grant, SB",Oct 7 2014 ,First-Order Contaminant Removal in the Hyporheic Zone of Streams: Physical Insights from a Simple Analytical Model,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"A simple analytical model is presented for the removal of stream-borne contaminants by hyporheic exchange across duned or rippled streambeds. The model assumes a steady-state balance between contaminant supply from the stream and first-order reaction in the sediment. Hyporheic exchange occurs by bed form pumping, in which water and contaminants flow into bed forms in high-pressure regions (downwelling zones) and out of bed forms in low-pressure regions (upwelling zones). Model-predicted contaminant concentrations are higher in downwelling zones than upwelling zones, reflecting the strong coupling that exists between transport and reaction in these systems. When flow-averaged, the concentration difference across upwelling and downwelling zones drives a net contaminant flux into the sediment bed proportional to the average downwelling velocity. The downwelling velocity is functionally equivalent to a mass transfer coefficient, and can be estimated from stream state variables including stream velocity, bed form geometry, and the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the sediment. Increasing the mass transfer coefficient increases the fraction of streamwater cycling through the hyporheic zone (per unit length of stream) but also decreases the time contaminants undergo first-order reaction in the sediment. As a consequence, small changes in stream state variables can significantly alter the performance of hyporheic zone treatment systems.Show less"
25,"Ward, AS",Feb 2016 ,Hydrogeomorphic controls on hyporheic and riparian transport in two headwater mountain streams during base flow recession,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Solute transport along riparian and hyporheic flow paths is broadly expected to respond to dynamic hydrologic forcing by streams, aquifers, and hillslopes. However, direct observation of these dynamic responses is lacking, as is the relative control of geologic setting as a control on responses to dynamic hydrologic forcing. We conducted a series of four stream solute tracer injections through base flow recession in each of two watersheds with contrasting valley morphology in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, monitoring tracer concentrations in the stream and in a network of shallow riparian wells in each watershed. We found hyporheic mean arrival time, temporal variance, and fraction of stream water in the bedrock-constrained valley bottom and near large roughness elements in the wider valley bottom were not variable with discharge, suggesting minimal control by hydrologic forcing. Conversely, we observed increases in mean arrival time and temporal variance and decreasing fraction stream water with decreasing discharge near the hillslopes in the wider valley bottom. This may indicate changes in stream discharge and valley bottom hydrology control transport in less constrained locations. We detail five hydrogeomorphic responses to base flow recession to explain observed spatial and temporal patterns in the interactions between streams and their valley bottoms. Models able to account for the transition from geologically dominated processes in the near-stream subsurface to hydrologically dominated processes near the hillslope will be required to predict solute transport and fate in valley bottoms of headwater mountain streams.Show less"
26,"Huizenga, A",Apr 2017 ,Stream-aquifer and in-stream processes affecting nitrogen along a major river and contributing tributary,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,"This study assesses the spatio-temporal patterns of water and nutrient mass exchange in a stream-riparian system of a major river and a contributing tributary in an irrigated semi-arid region. Field monitoring is performed along reaches of the Arkansas River (4.7 km) and Timpas Creek (2.0 km) in southeastern Colorado during the 2014 growing season, with water quantity and water quality data collected using a network of in-stream sampling sites and groundwater monitoring wells. Mass balance approaches were used to identify temporal and spatial trends in flow, nitrogen (N), and salinity in stream-aquifer exchange. In the Arkansas River, percent decrease of N concentration along the study reach averaged 36% over the period, with results from a stochastic mass balance simulation indicating a 90% probability that 44% to 50% of NO3-N mass in the study reach (109-124 kg/day/km) was removed by in-stream processes between 1 September and 8 November. Results suggest that contact with organic-rich river bed sediments has a strong impact on N removal. A greater decrease in concentrations of NO3-N along the reach during the low flow period suggests the effect of both in-stream processes and dilution by inflowing groundwater that undergoes denitrification as it flows through the riparian and hyporheic zones into the river. In contrast, N concentration decreases in the smaller Timpas Creek were negligible. Results for the Arkansas River also are in contrast with other large agriculturally-influenced rivers, which have not exhibited capacity to remove N at significant rates. Results provide important insights across spatial and temporal scales and point to the need for investigating nutrient dynamics in large streams draining agriculturally-dominated watersheds.

27,"Li, HY",Nov 2018 ,Barrier-based Longitudinal Connectivity Index for Managing Urban Rivers,WATER,"A large variety of barriers can affect longitudinal connectivity, which leads to shipping blocking and even flood hazard. However, few existing methods can quantify physically the river channel connectivity from the barrier's details perspective in a watershed. This paper establishes a new model of the River Channel Connectivity Index (RCCI) to quantify the unobstructed degree of river flow in river channels within geographic information system (GIS ) platforms based on the modified concept of time accessibility. A comprehensive classification system of barriers is setup before these barriers are identified by the remote sensing technology. The model is applied to Dashi Watershed in suburban Beijing, China. Results show that submersible bridges and sediment siltation are the main barriers in the watershed. RCCI values in the mountainous areas are generally higher than that of the plains. The assessment results verified by two historical flood events show that the RCCI can reveal where the river channel connectivity is impaired, how serious it is, and what the reason is for managers. Through scenarios' results, the best restoration measure for each tributary is obtained from the perspective of reducing flood hazards. The new RCCI method not only has methodological significance, but also helps policymakers to enhance river flooding reduction and determine restoration priorities of the river channel.Show less"
28,"Stern, N",Aug 2017 ,"Colonization Habitat Controls Biomass, Composition, and Metabolic Activity of Attached Microbial Communities in the Columbia River Hyporheic Corridor",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Hydrologic exchange plays a critical role in biogeochemical cycling within the hyporheic zone (the interface between river water and groundwater) of riverine ecosystems. Such exchange may set limits on the rates of microbial metabolism and impose deterministic selection on microbial communities that adapt to dynamically changing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources. This study examined the response of attached microbial communities (in situ colonized sand packs) from groundwater, hyporheic, and riverbed habitats within the Columbia River hyporheic corridor to ""cross-feeding"" with either groundwater, river water, or DOC-free artificial fluids. Our working hypothesis was that deterministic selection during in situ colonization would dictate the response to cross-feeding, with communities displaying maximal biomass and respiration when supplied with their native fluid source. In contrast to expectations, the major observation was that the riverbed colonized sand had much higher biomass and respiratory activity, as well as a distinct community structure, compared with those of the hyporheic and groundwater colonized sands. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed a much higher proportion of certain heterotrophic taxa as well as significant numbers of eukaryotic algal chloroplasts in the riverbed colonized sand. Significant quantities of DOC were released from riverbed sediment and colonized sand, and separate experiments showed that the released DOC stimulated respiration in the groundwater and piezometer colonized sand. These results suggest that the accumulation and degradation of labile particulate organic carbon (POC) within the riverbed are likely to release DOC, which may enter the hyporheic corridor during hydrologic exchange, thereby stimulating microbial activity and imposing deterministic selective pressure on the microbial community composition.IMPORTANCE The influence of river water-groundwater mixing on hyporheic zone microbial community structure and function is an important but poorly understood component of riverine biogeochemistry. This study employed an experimental approach to gain insight into how such mixing might be expected to influence the biomass, respiration, and composition of hyporheic zone microbial communities. Colonized sands from three different habitats (groundwater, river water, and hyporheic) were "" cross-fed"" with either groundwater, river water, or DOC-free artificial fluids. We expected that the colonization history would dictate the response to cross-feeding, with communities displaying maximal biomass and respiration when supplied with their native fluid source. By contrast, the major observation was that the riverbed communities had much higher biomass and respiration, as well as a distinct community structure compared with those of the hyporheic and groundwater colonized sands. These results highlight the importance of riverbed microbial metabolism in organic carbon processing in hyporheic corridors.Show less"
29,"Sosa-Perez, G",Apr 2017 ,"Wildfire effects on road surface erosion, deposition, and road-stream connectivity",EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"High and moderate severity wildfires should increase sediment production from unpaved roads due to the increased surface runoff from upslope, and increase road-stream connectivity due to the decrease in downslope surface roughness as well as the increase in surface runoff and erosion. Because no study has documented these effects, we surveyed road surface erosion features and quantified road-stream connectivity as a function of fire severity and road segment characteristics. The data were collected one year after the High Park wildfire from 141 hydrologically distinct road segments along 6.8km of an unpaved road west of Fort Collins, Colorado. Road segments below areas burned at high and moderate severity had significantly more rills than road segments below areas that burned at low severity. Road segment slope was an important control on the proportion of segment length with rills, and the strength of the relationship between road segment slope and the amount of rilling increased with burn severity. Flatter road segments tended to capture the sediment eroded from upslope burned areas. In areas burned at high and moderate severity all of the road segments had drainage features extending to a stream, and 78% of the segments in areas burned at low severity also were connected. These exceptionally high rates of road-stream connectivity are attributed to the increased runoff from upslope, the segment-scale collection and funneling of hillslope and road surface runoff to a single drainage point, and the reduced infiltration and trapping capacity of the burned area below the road. The results show the need to either outslope the roads or increase the frequency of constructed drainage features after wildfires, particularly for steeper road segments in areas burned at high or moderate severity.

30,"Denfeld, BA",2013 ,"Summer CO2 evasion from streams and rivers in the Kolyma River basin, north-east Siberia",POLAR RESEARCH,"Inland water systems are generally supersaturated in carbon dioxide (CO2) and are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the global carbon cycle. The Arctic may be particularly important in this respect, given the abundance of inland waters and carbon contained in Arctic soils; however, a lack of trace gas measurements from small streams in the Arctic currently limits this understanding. We investigated the spatial variability of CO2 evasion during the summer low-flow period from streams and rivers in the northern portion of the Kolyma River basin in north-eastern Siberia. To this end, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and gas exchange velocities (k) were measured at a diverse set of streams and rivers to calculate CO2 evasion fluxes. We combined these CO2 evasion estimates with satellite remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to calculate total areal CO2 emissions. Our results show that small streams are substantial sources of atmospheric CO2 owing to high pCO(2) and k, despite being a small portion of total inland water surface area. In contrast, large rivers were generally near equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Extrapolating our findings across the Panteleikha - Ambolikha sub-watersheds demonstrated that small streams play a major role in CO2 evasion, accounting for 86% of the total summer CO2 emissions from inland waters within these two sub-watersheds. Further expansion of these regional CO2 emission estimates across time and space will be critical to accurately quantify and understand the role of Arctic streams and rivers in the global carbon budget.Show less"
31,"Schmitgen, LM",Dec 2021 ,Model Choice Impacts the Quantification of Seasonal Hyporheic Exchange Depths and Fluxes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Direction and depths of hyporheic exchange fluxes at the groundwater - surface water interface are drivers of biogeochemical processes influencing nutrient cycling and water quality. Model concepts on the dynamic relationship between hyporheic exchange fluxes and exchange depth are typically based on the assumption of a linear relationship between both measures. Here, we quantify seasonal and episodic variations of hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic exchange depths with methods of heat tracing. Numerically (FLUX-BOT) and analytically (VFLUX; method based on temperature amplitude dampening developed by Hatch et al., 2006, https://doi.org/10.1029/2005wr004787) working program scripts were used to solve the one-dimensional conduction-advection-dispersion equation and compute hyporheic flux rates from three vertical sediment water temperature profiles recorded continuously in a small low mountain creek between 2011 and 2017. By comparing the behavior of two differing water temperature-based modeling approaches, dissimilarities in the sensitivity to sediment thermal properties were identified. Besides the differences in parameter responsivity differences in how the temperature data is incorporated, explain deviating behavior of the models regarding exchange flux and depth calculations. We show that the vertical extension of hyporheic exchange depth has a distinctive seasonal pattern over seven years, which differs according to the positioning in the riffle-pool-sequence. Surface water levels, groundwater levels and stream discharges show significant correlations with both flux direction and hyporheic zone extension. Temperature derived flux data allowed for establishing a significant relationship between hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic exchange depths.Show less"
32,"Mishra, K",Apr 15 2019 ,Towards the assessment of sediment connectivity in a large Himalayan river basin,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Sediment connectivity, defined as the degree of linkage between the sediment sources to downstream areas, is one of the most important properties that control landscape evolution in river basins. The degree of linkages amongst different parts of a catchment depends mainly on the hinterland characteristics (e.g. catchment morphology, slope, shape, relief, and elevation), channel characteristics (e.g. slope, stream network density, valley confinement), and the combined effects of vegetation (e.g. land use changes and land abandonment). This paper evaluates the sediment connectivity of the upper Kosi basin covering an area of similar to 52,731 km(2) including Tibet and Nepal at different spatial scales. We have computed the index of connectivity (IC) using the equations originally proposed by Borselli et al. (2008) andmodified by Cavalli et al. (2013) to evaluate the potential connection of sediment source areas to the primary channel network as well to the catchment outlet. Our results highlight significant spatial variability in sediment connectivity across the basin and provide important insights on structural sediment dynamics in a complex geological and geomorphological setting. We compare our results with the observed sediment load data at certain outlets and demonstrate that sediment flux in different subbasins is controlled by variable slope distribution and land use and land cover that are strongly related to the structural connectivity. We argue that IC model can be extremely beneficial to understand sediment dynamics at catchment scale in a large river basin (similar to 10(3)-10(4) km(2) scale), where systematic field investigations for mapping hillslope-channel linkages are not feasible.

Some investigators have studied the effects of restoration on the hyporheic zone, but most used space-for-time substitution instead of comparing the same reach before and after restoration. We examined spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange rates and geochemistry during base flow in a 30-m pool-riffle-pool sequence before and 1 y after the stream was restored by installation of a cross-vane and engineered rock-riffle. Prerestoration vertical hyporheic exchange rates were relatively uniform across the riffle bedform. Average downwelling was 30 cm/d at or upstream of the riffle, and average upwelling was 30 cm/d downstream of the riffle. Downwelling hyporheic exchange rates increased up to an order of magnitude adjacent to the cross-vane and in the engineered rock-riffle. Prerestoration porewater [NO3-] was distributed along a wide and continuous gradient (0.1-3.8 mg/L), with higher concentrations in areas of downwelling and lower concentrations in areas of upwelling. Postrestoration [NO3-] was distributed bimodally with relatively high concentrations (>1.6 mg/L) adjacent to the cross-vane and low concentrations (<1 mg/L) elsewhere. These results suggest that rapid flushing of surface water through the subsurface creates residence times too short to yield net changes in [NO3-] along flow paths around the cross-vane. Distinct zones of groundwater upwelling were present before and after restoration, but the size of the zone of upwelling increased downstream of the cross-vane after restoration, possibly because higher permeability material was placed over the original, lower permeability sediment during restoration, creating an effective anisotropy that favored horizontal flow and produced larger apparent zones of groundwater discharge.Show less"

The terrestrial-aquatic interface beneath a riparian corridor was investigated as a region of hydrological and biological control of nutrient flux. Subsurface flow paths were defined from the channel toward the riparian zone and also from the riparian zone toward the channel using tracer-injection studies. Solute transport had a rapid channel component (m min-1) and a slow hyporheic flow component (m h-1, m day-1). Subsurface flow beneath the riparian zone approximated a straight path entering at meanders but could also cross beneath the stream, possibly using relic channels.2. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the hyporheic zone ranged from < 1.0 to 9.5 mg l-1 due to permeability variations in bankside sediments. DO concentration was related to the proportion of stream water in the lateral hyporheic zone, indicating that the channel water was the DO source.3. The magnitude and timing of lateral water exchange was linked to previously published studies of nitrification and denitrification. Both nitrification potential and channel exchange decreased with distance from the channel and were absent at sites lacking effective exchange, due to low DO. Field amendment of ammonium to an aerobic flow path indicated nitrification potential under natural hydrological conditions. Denitrification potential was inversely related to channel exchange and was insignificant in channel sediments. Field amendment of acetylene plus nitrate to a flow path with low DO and minimal channel exchange indicated denitrification of amended nitrate.4. Comparison of hydraulic head to distribution of the biologically important solutes DO, ammonium, and nitrate was useful for interpreting previous findings and conceptualizing the riparian zone as a functioning ecotone between terrestrial and aquatic systems.Show less"
35,"Salehin, M",Sep 2003 ,Comparison of transient storage in vegetated and unvegetated reaches of a small agricultural stream in Sweden: seasonal variation and anthropogenic manipulation,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"In this work, we compare solute transport and hyporheic exchange in vegetated and unvegetated reaches of Sava Brook, an agricultural stream in Sweden subject to extreme variations in channel vegetation and morphology due to both natural seasonal effects and anthropogenic manipulation. A solute injection experiment was conducted in September, 2001 (late summer), at which time there was extensive in-channel vegetation in upstream reaches but none in downstream reaches due to channel excavation by farmers. Experimental results are interpreted using both the advective storage path model and the transient storage model. Results from the vegetated and excavated reaches of the stream are compared both with each other and with the results of a previous experiment conducted in April, 1998 (early spring), when the stream was not excavated but there was only minimal vegetation present in the area due to natural seasonal effects. Results from the two injection experiments are compared by using scaled parameters that appropriately include the effects of stream velocity and depth on hyporheic exchange. This analysis indicates that the variation of solute storage time in all non-excavated agricultural reaches is attributable to differences in stream flow depth, velocity, and the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed sediments. Mixing in vegetated reaches is characterized by rapid exchange and considerable lag of the mean solute peak relative to the mean channel velocity. In addition, excavation altered the stream channel geometry so as to increase the storage time of solutes and reduce the effective exchange rate. This work indicates the need to consider the effect of specific processes when analyzing hyporheic exchange using tracer-injection methods, and supports the use of model frameworks with the potential to explicitly include different formulations for various hyporheic and dead zone transport processes.

The thermal method has been widely used to understand water exchange patterns in a hyporheic zone. This study was conducted in theWeihe River catchment in Shaanxi Province, China. A conceptual model was developed to determine water transfer patterns, and a one-dimensional heat diffusion-advection equation was employed to estimate vertical fluxes of ten different segments in the hyporheic zone in various ten segments of the catchment. The amount of water exchange varied from 78.47 mm/d to 23.66 mm/d and a decreasing trend from the upstream to downstream of catchment was observed. The spatial correlation of variability between the water exchange and distance is 0.62. The results indicate that mountain's topography trend is the primary driver influencing the distribution of river tributaries, and the water exchange amount has a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream of the main river channel.Show less"

Through intensive monitoring of Chalk groundwater, shallow gravel groundwater and surface water in the River Lambourn, UK, using a combination of hydrochemical and hydrophysical techniques, a complex pattern of interactions has been elucidated. The river is broadly in hydraulic contact with the streambed sediments and adjacent gravels and sands, but these deposits are mainly hydraulically separate from the underlying Chalk at the site. The hydraulic relationship between the river and underlying alluvium is variable, involving components of groundwater flow both parallel and transverse to the river and with both effluent and influent behaviour seen. While the gravel aquifer is significant in controlling groundwater/surface-water interaction, its importance as a route for flow down the catchment is likely to be modest compared with river discharge. The hydrological complexity revealed in a geological setting typical of lowland UK Chalk streams has implications both for investigation methods and for management such as in the setting of environmental objectives in the European Water Framework Directive.Show less"
38,"Lautz, LK",Nov 2006 ,Modeling surface and ground water mixing in the hyporheic zone using MODFLOW and MT3D,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"We used a three-dimensional MODFLOW model, paired with MT3D, to simulate hyporheic zones around debris dams and meanders along a semi-arid stream. MT3D simulates both advective transport and sink/source mixing of solutes, in contrast to particle tracking (e.g. MODPATH), which only considers advection. We delineated the hydrochemically active hyporheic zone based on a new definition, specifically as near-stream subsurface zones receiving a minimum of 10% surface water within a 10-day travel time. Modeling results indicate that movement of surface water into the hyporheic zone is predominantly an advective process. We show that debris dams are a key driver of surface water into the subsurface along the experimental reach, causing the largest flux rates of water across the streambed and creating hyporheic zones with up to twice the cross-sectional area of other hyporheic zones. Hyporheic exchange was also found in highly sinuous segments of the experimental reach, but flux rates are lower and the cross-sectional areas of these zones are generally smaller. Our modeling approach simulated surface and ground water mixing in the hyporheic zone, and thus provides numerical approximations that are more comparable to field-based observations of surface-groundwater exchange than standard particle-tracking simulations.

39,"Fasching, C",Mar 2016 ,Hydrology controls dissolved organic matter export and composition in an Alpine stream and its hyporheic zone,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Streams and rivers transport dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the terrestrial environment to downstream ecosystems. In light of climate and global change it is crucial to understand the temporal dynamics of DOM concentration and composition, and its export fluxes from headwaters to larger downstream ecosystems. We monitored DOM concentration and composition based on a diurnal sampling design for 3 years in an Alpine headwater stream. We found hydrologic variability to control DOM composition and the coupling of DOM dynamics in the streamwater and the hyporheic zone. High-flow events increased DOM inputs from terrestrial sources (as indicated by the contributions of humic- and fulvic-like fluorescence), while summer baseflow enhanced the autochthonous imprint of DOM. Diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM composition were likely induced by biological processes linked to temperature and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Floods frequently interrupted diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM, which led to a decoupling of streamwater and hyporheic water DOM composition and delivery of aromatic and humic-like DOM to the streamwater. Accordingly, DOM export fluxes were largely of terrigenous origin as indicated by optical properties. Our study highlights the relevance of hydrologic and seasonal dynamics for the origin, composition and fluxes of DOM in an Alpine headwater stream.Show less"

Sites were sampled in autumn and spring using three different hyporheic sampling methods (colonisation pots, pump sampling, and freeze-coring). Total invertebrate abundance and taxon richness differed significantly among sites on both sampling occasions for pump samples, whereas freeze-coring did not discriminate among sites, and pot samples showed significant differences in autumn, but not in spring. Differences among sites with respect to community composition were not consistent between sampling methods. Community ordination indicated that samples from colonisation pots tended to group together, whereas pump and freeze core samples were widely separated. Differences across land uses were also apparent (native forest sites formed a distinct cluster separated from pine and pasture sites). Results suggest that colonisation pots may provide a pathway for the entry of epigean organisms into the hyporheic zone even when hydraulic connectivity between surface and hyporheic zones is low. Invertebrate abundance was very low in pump samples, and this method also captured the fewest taxa of the three methods. The size bias known to exist with pump sampling techniques may restrict the usefulness of the method when comparing streams of differing hydraulic conductivity.Show less"

The potential for hyporheic exchange in covered channels (i.e., ice-covered channels, karst conduits, fractures) with permeable sediments has not yet been assessed. We characterize the potential for hyporheic exchange in covered channels using linked turbulent channel flow/groundwater flow simulations. Simulations show that hyporheic exchange occurs in covered channels which have shallower hyporheic zones and larger hyporheic fluxes than equivalent-depth equivalent-discharge uncovered channels. We also analyzed hyporheic exchange for the case of freely floating covers with rough undersides and found that hyporheic exchange decreases with increasing cover roughness which in turn is driven by subdued bed topography, a response to additional resistance due to covers. The results suggest that hyporheic exchange occurs in covered channels and may be just as or perhaps more important to the ecology and biogeochemistry of these channels than to open channel streams.Show less"
43,"Cleven, EJ",May 2003 ,A sandy hyporheic zone limited vertically by a solid boundary,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Knowledge on sandy hyporheic zones in streams, especially those limited by a solid layer, is scarce. We studied seasonal and spatial patterns of abiotic parameters in the hyporheic zone of a lowland stream, in which the depth of the sandy sediment is limited by a layer of iron pan, a cemented and firm Fe- and Mn-rich horizon that hinders exchange between stream/interstitial water and ground water. Temperature, dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic matter, phosphorus, and nitrogen compounds in the interstitial water reflected the conditions of the infiltrating channel water. Concentrations of the abiotic parameters varied within the same ranges at all investigated depths, suggesting that interstitial water and channel water were very homogeneous. The exception was dissolved oxygen, where interstitial concentration was lower. However, the spatial distribution of interstitial dissolved oxygen, examined at a small scale (decimetre/centimetre level), did not follow a uniform pattern. These data contribute to a better understanding and documentation of sandy hyporheic zone characteristics.Show less"

These changes may greatly disturb the adjacent ecosystems, particularly streams, where the effects of pollution are amplified. In this study, we used the leaf litter breakdown rate to assess the functional integrity of stream ecosystems and river sediments along a gradient of either traditional extensive farming or a gradient of vineyard area. In the benthic layer, the total litter breakdown process integrates the temporal variability of the anthropogenic disturbances and is strongly influenced by land use changes in the catchment even though a low concentration of toxics was measured during the study period. This study also confirmed the essential role played by amphipods in the litter breakdown process. In contrast, microbial processes may have integrated the variations in available nutrients and dissolved oxygen concentrations, but failed to respond to the disturbances induced by vineyard production (the increase in pesticides and metal concentrations) during the study period. The response of microbes may not be sensitive enough for assessing the global effect of seasonal agricultural practices. Finally, the leaf litter breakdown measured in the hyporheic zone seemed mainly driven by microbial activities and was hence more affected by vertical exchanges with surface water than by land use practices. However, the breakdown rate of leaf litter in the hyporheic zone may constitute a relevant way to evaluate the impact on river functioning of any human activities that induce massive soil erosion and sediment clogging.

45,"Alexander, LC",Apr 2018 ,Featured Collection Introduction: Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to Downstream Waters,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Connectivity is a fundamental but highly dynamic property of watersheds. Variability in the types and degrees of aquatic ecosystem connectivity presents challenges for researchers and managers seeking to accurately quantify its effects on critical hydrologic, biogeochemical, and biological processes. However, protecting natural gradients of connectivity is key to protecting the range of ecosystem services that aquatic ecosystems provide. In this featured collection, we review the available evidence on connections and functions by which streams and wetlands affect the integrity of downstream waters such as large rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and estuaries. The reviews in this collection focus on the types of waters whose protections under the U.S. Clean Water Act have been called into question by U.S. Supreme Court cases. We synthesize 40+ years of research on longitudinal, lateral, and vertical fluxes of energy, material, and biota between aquatic ecosystems included within the Act's frame of reference. Many questions about the roles of streams and wetlands in sustaining downstream water integrity can be answered from currently available literature, and emerging research is rapidly closing data gaps with exciting new insights into aquatic connectivity and function at local, watershed, and regional scales. Synthesis of foundational and emerging research is needed to support science-based efforts to provide safe, reliable sources of fresh water for present and future generations.Show less"
46,"Jones, JB",1995 ,"Methanogenesis in Arizona, USA dryland streams",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Methanogenesis was studied in five streams of central and southern Arizona by examining the distribution of methane in interstitial water and evasion of methane in three subsystems (hyporheic, parafluvial and bank sediments). In Sycamore Creek, the primary study site (studied during summer and early autumn), methane content of interstitial water exhibited a distinct spatial pattern. In hyporheic (sediments beneath the wetted channel) and parfluvial zones (active channel sediments lateral to the wetted channel), which were well oxygenated due to high hydrologic exchange with the surface stream and had little particulate organic matter (POM), interstitial methane concentration averaged only 0.03 mgCH(4)-C/L. Bank sediments (interface between the active channel and riparian zone), in contrast, which were typically vegetated, had high POM, low hydrologic exchange and concomitantly low dissolved oxygen levels, had interstitial concentration averaging 1.5 mgCH(4)-C/L. Methane emission from Sycamore Creek, similar to methane concentration, averaged only 3.7 mgCH(4)-C . m(-2). d(-1) from hyporheic and parafluvial zones as opposed to 170 mgCH(4)-C . m(-2). d(-1) from anoxic bank sediments. Methane in four additional streams sampled (one sampling date during late winter) was low and exhibited little spatial variation most likely due to cooler stream temperatures. Interstitial methane in parafluvial and bank sediments of all four streams ranged from only 0.005 to 0.1 mgCH(4)-C/L. Similarly methane evasion was also low from these streams varying from 0 to 5.7 mgCH(4)-C . m(-2). d(-1). The effects of organic matter and temperature on methanogenesis were further examined by experimentally manipulating POM and temperature in stoppered flasks filled with hyporheic sediments and stream water. Methane production significantly increased with all independent variables. Methane production is greatest in bank sediments that are relatively isolated hydrologically and lowest in hyporheic and parafluvial sediments that are interactive with the surface stream.Show less"
47,"Phanikumar, MS",May 1 2007 ,Separating surface storage from hyporheic retention in natural streams using wavelet decomposition of acoustic Doppler current profiles,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The ability to separate surface storage (e.g., due to in-channel features such as eddies and pools) from retention due to hyporheic exchange is important in many solute transport considerations; however, current stream tracer approaches do not allow such separation. We examined transient storage processes in a fourth-order Michigan stream using tracer studies, numerical flow and transport models, and hydrodynamic data obtained from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) surveys. Since the high-resolution, three-dimensional velocity fields obtained from an ADCP relate to in-channel processes, we used wavelet decomposition to separate the flow into regions of slow and fast moving zones and to estimate the relative sizes of the main channel (A) and the storage zones (AS). Transport modeling based on the tracer data provided estimates of storage zone sizes that included contributions from both surface storage and hyporheic exchange. By coupling the estimates from tracer data with those obtained from an ADCP we were able to assess the relative importance of surface storage in different stream reaches. Estimated (A(S)/A) values in three test reaches ranged from 0.12 to 0.22, and transient storage residence times varied from approximately 4 min in a run reach dominated by surface storage (reach A) to about 13 min in a reach with some potential for hyporheic exchange (reach C). In reach A the (A(S)/A) values estimated from tracer and ADCP data were in good agreement, indicating that in-channel processes were the main mechanism responsible for storage in this reach. Reach C estimates, however, showed that surface storage (A(S)/A= 0.05) accounted for only a fraction of the transient storage estimated using tracer data (A(S)/A = 0.12), which indicated that hyporheic exchange contributed to transient storage in the reach. The wavelet decomposition approach based on the ADCP data provides a framework to better constrain transient storage models and to eliminate unrealistic parameters.Show less"
48,"Wang, Z",Jun 15 2022 ,Streambed microbial communities in the transition zone between groundwater and a first-order stream as impacted by bidirectional water exchange,WATER RESEARCH,"The input of nitrate and other agricultural pollutants in higher-order streams largely derives from first-order streams. The streambed as the transition zone between groundwater and stream water has a decisive impact on the attenuation of such pollutants. This reactivity is not yet well understood for lower-order agricultural streams, which are often anthropogenically altered and lack the streambed complexity allowing for extensive hyporheic exchange. Reactive hot spots in such streambeds have been hypothesized as a function of hydrology, which controls the local gaining (groundwater exfiltration) or losing (infiltration) of stream water. However, streambed microbial communities and activities associated with such reactive zones remain mostly uncharted. In this study, sediments of a first-order agriculturally impacted stream in southern Germany were investigated. Along with a hydraulic dissection of distinct gaining and losing reaches of the stream, community composition and the abundance of bacterial communities in the streambed were investigated using PacBio long-read sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons, and qPCR of bacterial 16S rRNA and denitrification genes (nirK and nirS). We show that bidirectional water exchange between groundwater and the stream represents an important control for sediment microbiota, especially for nitrate-reducing populations. Typical heterotrophic denitrifiers were most abundant in a midstream net losing section, while up-and downstream net gaining sections were associated with an enrichment of sulfur-oxidizing potential nitrate reducers affiliated with Sulfuricurvum and Thiobacillus spp. Dispersal-based community assembly was found to dominate such spots of groundwater exfiltration. Our results indicate a coupling of N-and S-cycling processes in the streambed of an agricultural first-order stream, and a prominent control of microbiology by hydrology and hydrochemistry in situ. Such detailed local heterogeneities in exchange fluxes and streambed microbiomes have not been reported to date, but seem relevant for understanding the reactivity of lower-order streams.Show less"
49,"Xingyuan, Z",Feb 2023 ,Impact of changes in river network structure on hydrological connectivity of watersheds,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"River network connectivity is a key factor affecting watershed ecosystems and an important criterion for evaluating the health of river. The river network structure of the basin has changed dramatically in recent years due to human activity, but the response of connectivity to changes in physical structure is still poorly understood. In this paper, a dynamic index (connectivity index) based on daily-scale flow and probability density function is proposed to characterize the connectivity capacity of river networks. The Haihe River basin in China is selected as the study area, and a graphic model is constructed to assess the evolutionary structure of the river network. The 54 sections were classified into Low human impact (LHI) and High human impact (HHI), and the trends and causes of connectivity changes of the sections with the evolution of the network were analyzed. The results reveal that the river network degree and clustering coefficient keep increasing, the path length decreases and becomes more dense downstream, and the river network gradually evolves into a ""small-world"" network. The ""smallworld"" characteristics improve the potential efficiency and specific functionality of the river network, but make the physical structure mismatch with the hydraulic gradient, and the network flow disperses severely, leading to a significant decrease in connectivity (HHI connectivity index is lower than LHI 52.1%). Moreover, the structural changes enhance the spatial and temporal differences in hydrological connectivity, which further restricts the function of the river system. ""Small-world"" and connectivity indicators (duration, start time, and intermittency) show strong correlations. Therefore, physical structure is an important factor influencing connectivity capacity of river networks. The planning and management of the watershed should consider the changes in hydrological connectivity caused by the structural modifications of the river network.Show less"
