0,"Fudyma, JD",Jan 18 2021 ,Coupled Biotic-Abiotic Processes Control Biogeochemical Cycling of Dissolved Organic Matter in the Columbia River Hyporheic Zone,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"A critical component of assessing the impacts of climate change on watershed ecosystems involves understanding the role that dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays in driving whole ecosystem metabolism. The hyporheic zone-a biogeochemical control point where ground water and river water mix-is characterized by high DOM turnover and microbial activity and is responsible for a large fraction of lotic respiration. Yet, the dynamic nature of this ecotone provides a challenging but important environment to parse out different DOM influences on watershed function and net carbon and nutrient fluxes. We used high-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to provide a detailed molecular characterization of DOM and its transformation pathways in the Columbia river watershed. Samples were collected from ground water (adjacent unconfined aquifer underlying the Hanford 300 Area), Columbia river water, and its hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone was sampled at five locations to capture spatial heterogeneity within the hyporheic zone. Our results revealed that abiotic transformation pathways (e.g., carboxylation), potentially driven by abiotic factors such as sunlight, in both the ground water and river water are likely influencing DOM availability to the hyporheic zone, which could then be coupled with biotic processes for enhanced microbial activity. The ground water profile revealed high rates of N and S transformations via abiotic reactions. The river profile showed enhanced abiotic photodegradation of lignin-like molecules that subsequently entered the hyporheic zone as low molecular weight, more degraded compounds. While the compounds in river water were in part bio-unavailable, some were further shown to increase rates of microbial respiration. Together, river water and ground water enhance microbial activity within the hyporheic zone, regardless of river stage, as shown by elevated putative amino-acid transformations and the abundance of amino-sugar and protein-like compounds. This enhanced microbial activity is further dependent on the composition of ground water and river water inputs. Our results further suggest that abiotic controls on DOM should be incorporated into predictive modeling for understanding watershed dynamics, especially as climate variability and land use could affect light exposure and changes to ground water essential elements, both shown to impact the Columbia river hyporheic zone.Show less"
1,"DiStefano, RJ",Mar 2009 ,Imperiled crayfishes use hyporheic zone during seasonal drying of an intermittent stream,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Despite the prevalence and importance of intermittent streams, few studies have examined their use by crayfishes. We documented persistence in an intermittent stream and use of the hyporheic zone by 2 imperiled crayfishes, Orconectes williamsi and Orconectes meeki meeki, upon stream drying. During 2005 to 2007, we monitored summer flows and crayfish densities in 10 riffles in a Missouri (US) Ozark stream to document stream drying and crayfish persistence. Stream drying variables were riffle wetted area (m(2)) and current velocity (m/s). Crayfish density estimates were obtained with a quadrat sampler. We sampled monthly (May-August 2006) to examine crayfish response to decreased flows, and excavated dry quadrat samples (to 30 cm depth) after surface flows ceased. Over 2 periods during summer 2007, we used baited traps in the stream and a downstream reservoir where the stream terminates to examine whether crayfish migrated from the stream to permanent water in response to drying. Riffles dried significantly by July, few had surface water present by August, and all were rewetted by the following June. Annual June densities of O. williamsi remained stable throughout the study, whereas densities of O. m. meeki were lower in 2007 than 2005. Both species burrowed to the hyporheic zone during drying, and crayfish densities were similar to those estimated in riffles before drying. We found no evidence that either species migrated to permanent water in the reservoir during drying. Use by crayfish of the hyporheic zone during drying and interannual persistence in intermittent streams suggests that hyporheic habitats are important for conservation of these crayfishes. Our study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge that indicates the importance of intermittent streams for conservation of freshwater biodiversity.Show less"
2,"Kiel, BA",Jun 2014 ,Lateral hyporheic exchange throughout the Mississippi River network,NATURE GEOSCIENCE,"River water circulates vertically through the river bed and laterally through bank sediments(1-4). This hyporheic exchange brings river water into contact with microbes in the adjacent sediments, otherwise known as the hyporheic exchange zone. As such, hyporheic zones act as hotspots for the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, metals and nutrients in rivers(1,2,5-8), and can, for example, influence the export of nitrogen to downstream ecosystems(5,9,10). Here, we calculate the extent and duration of lateral hyporheic exchange throughout the Mississippi River network, using a physics-based numerical model that takes into account the distribution of groundwater baseflow, river discharge, alluvium permeability and river morphology(3,4). We find that in our simulations, lateral exchange occurs throughout the network: practically all of the river water that reaches the mouth of the Mississippi River network has circulated through the lateral hyporheic zone. River water residence time in the hyporheic zone ranges from less than an hour in headwaters to over a month in larger channels. Comparison of the residence times that we derive to a previously reported residence time threshold for denitrification suggests that around one quarter of the lateral hyporheic zones in the Mississippi River network favour denitrification, and thus nitrogen loss. Given that river water can circulate many times through the river bank before reaching the river mouth, and can undergo vertical exchange with the river bed, we suggest that our estimates serve as a lower limit for potential nitrogen loss.Show less"
3,"Zhou, T",Aug 2013 ,Reshaping of the hyporheic zone beneath river restoration structures: Flume and hydrodynamic experiments,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In-channel stream restoration structures readjust surface water hydraulics, streambed pressure, and subsurface hyporheic exchange characteristics. In this study, we conducted flume experiments (pool-riffle amplitude of 0.03 m and wavelengths of 0.5 m) and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations to quantify how restoration structures impacted hyporheic penetration depth, D-p, and hyporheic vertical discharge rate, Q(v). Restoration structures were channel-spanning vanes with subsurface footers placed in the gravel bed at each riffle. Hyporheic vertical discharge rate was estimated by analyzing solute concentration decay data, and maximum hyporheic penetration depth was measured as the interface between hyporheic water and groundwater using dye tracing experiments. The CFD was verified with literature-based flume hydraulic data and with D-p and Q(z) observations, and the CFD was then used to document how D-p and Q(z) varied with flume discharge, Q, ranging from 1 to 15 L/s (3E+03hyporheic zone. Q(z) had a positive linear relationship with Q, while D-p initially grew as Q increased, but then shrunk when a hydraulic jump with low streambed pressured formed downstream of the structure. The restoration structures created counter-acting forces of increased downwelling head due to backwater effects, and increased upwelling due to low streambed pressure and standing waves downstream of the structure.Key Points in-channel structures accelerate the hyporheic exchange rate in-channel structures reduce the hyporheic exchange zone higher flow rate induces greater hyporheic exchange rateShow less"
4,"Sobczak, WV",Nov 2002 ,Variation in bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon among stream hyporheic flowpaths,ECOLOGY,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dominates the flux of organic matter in most stream ecosystems, but the proportion susceptible to microbial degradation is often presumed to be low. The fraction of bulk DOC contributing to microbial metabolism was assessed in five streams representing the regional range in surface-water DOC concentration in eastern New York State, USA (range 0.5-7.7 mg/L; n = 82). Transects of shallow wells along two hyporheic flowpaths (i.e., saturated sediments found below and lateral to the open-stream channel in active exchange with surface waters) in each of five streams were sampled monthly at baseflow to determine changes in subsurface DOC and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Hyporheic DOC concentrations ranged from 50% to 100% of surface-water concentrations and decreased along hyporheic flowpaths in four of five streams. Dissolved oxygen losses along hyporheic flowpaths paralleled DOC loss, and bacterial activity on tiles incubated at points along the flowpaths generally declined as hyporheic DOC was depleted. DOC losses along natural flowpaths exceeded the quantity of DOC lost during laboratory bottle incubations, even when samples were amended with inorganic nutrients. Hyporheic mesocosms were used to examine the fate of stream-derived DOC along replicated flowpaths under controlled hydrologic conditions. The overall patterns of DOC losses along mesocosm flowpaths supplied with water from previously studied. streams were similar to DOC losses along natural flowpaths. DOC declines were paralleled by declines in bacterial activity and dissolved oxygen. Mesocosm results indicated that variation in percentage of DOC loss along natural flowpaths was not a function of dilution, residence time, or initial DOC concentration and-that subsurface DOC dynamics were linked to variation in microbial metabolism.The fraction of total. DOC available for metabolism varied markedly among regional streams and was independent of initial DOC concentration. DOC near the end of hyporheic flowpaths was not subject to further degradation, regardless of the bioavailability of surface-water DOC entering these flowpaths. Hence, in streams with significant hyporheic exchange, the amount and bioavailability of DOC transported to downstream ecosystems may be affected by subsurface metabolism. DOC depletion during hyporheic transport may provide a general in situ measure of bioavailable DOC in surface water and be a powerful predictor of rates of heterotrophic activity in sediments at the reach level.Show less"
5,"BOULTON, AJ",1993 ,"STREAM ECOLOGY AND SURFACE HYPORHEIC HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE - IMPLICATIONS, TECHNIQUES AND LIMITATIONS",,"In many streams with coarse substrata, there is continuous exchange between surface water and interstitial (hyporheic) water. Upwelling hyporheic water usually contains less dissolved oxygen and may provide nutrients that are limiting in the surface water. Downwelling stream water carries oxygen, surface detritus and other material to the hyporheic zone where microbes and invertebrates reside. The magnitude and direction of this hydrologic exchange can be measured using relatively simple techniques (such as dye injections and mini-piezometers) although there are some important limitations to consider. As hydrologic exchange has been shown to affect the distribution of benthic algae and invertebrates in some streams, this variable has implications for a variety of lotic studies including those of drift, leaf breakdown, benthic invertebrate colonization, sedimentation, and nutrient limitation. Experiments in flumes and artificial stream channels usually remove the influence of hydrologic exchange although it would be possible to incorporate this into their design. Stream ecologists should consider assessing the significance of the hyporheic zone to surface processes by quantifying the vectors of hydrologic exchange to ascertain how these may affect results of work conducted on the benthos at a variety of scales.Show less"
6,"Ren, J",Aug 11 2020 ,Quantification of the temporal-spatial distributions characteristics of streambed hyporheic exchange fluxes with the seasonal variation using heat as a tracer,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Groundwater-surface water interaction, particularly on exchange fluxes between streams and aquifers, plays a large role in the prerequisite conditions for the study of contaminants and nutrients in the hyporheic zone. One way to quantify these fluxes is by using heat as an environmental tracer. This study quantitatively analyzes the spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty of the vertical turbulent flow of a canopy in the Walker River Basin in Nevada, USA, using the thermal tracer method and the VFLUX software tool. Using the high spatial resolution temperature data measured by the US Geological Survey in the Walker River Basin in Nevada, with the finite element software, COMSOL Multiphysics, it establishes a two-dimensional, full-transect, water-thermal coupling calculation model for the river. The results show that long-term vertical hyporheic flux is between - 111.78 and 86.07 L/m(2)/d. The average vertical hyporheic flux under seasonal conditions was - 44.35 L/m(2)/d and - 36.78 L/m(2)/d in summer and winter, respectively, and the flux exhibits a non-monotonic change with increasing depth. By observing the similarity between the spatial distribution of streambed hyporheic exchange fluxes in winter and summer, as well as the distribution of the streambed profile temperature field, it was found that the spatial distribution of the average streambed hyporheic exchange fluxes can be clearly shown by the streambed profile temperature field in the corresponding season.Show less"
7,"Osenbruck, K",May 2013 ,"Assessing hyporheic exchange and associated travel times by hydraulic, chemical, and isotopic monitoring at the Steinlach Test Site, Germany",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"First results of a multi-disciplinary hyporheic monitoring study are presented from the newly established Steinlach Test Site in Southern Germany. The site is located in a bend of the River Steinlach (mean discharge of 1.8 mA(3)/s) underlain by an alluvial sandy gravel aquifer connected to the stream. The overall objective is a better understanding of hyporheic exchange processes at the site and their interrelations with microbial community dynamics and biochemical reactions at the stream-groundwater interface. The present paper focuses on the distribution of lateral hyporheic exchange fluxes and their associated travel times at the Steinlach Test Site. Water level dynamics in various piezometers correspond to the different domains of hydraulic conductivity in the shallow aquifer and confirms hyporheic exchange of infiltrated stream water across the test site. Hydrochemical compositions as well as increased damping of continuous time series of electrical conductivity (EC) and temperature at the respective piezometers confirmed the inferred distribution of hyporheic flowpaths. Mean travel times ranging from 0.5 days close to the stream to more than 8 days in the upstream part of the test site could be estimated from deconvolution of EC and delta O-18-H2O data. The travel times agree well with the presumed flowpaths. Mg/Ca ratios as well as model fits to the EC and delta O-18 data indicate the presence of an additional water component in the western part of the test site which most likely consists of hillslope water or groundwater. Based on the mean travel times, the total lateral hyporheic exchange flux at the site was estimated to be of the order of 1-2 L/s.Show less"
8,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",Jan 1 2019 ,Do thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing and direct hyporheic measurements (DHM) similarly detect river-groundwater exchanges? Study along a 40 km-section of the Ain River (France),SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Water exchanges through the hyporheic zone are crucial to many ecological processes in streams. One major challenge for river managers is to find a practical method for localizing these exchanges using rapid data acquisition techniques. This work compares spatially continuous data, acquired by Thermal Infrared (TIR) techniques, with discrete data collected in surface water and in the hyporheic zone (DHM), at sites of expected water exchanges (gravel bars). Forty gravel bars, distributed along a 40 km-sector of the Ain River were sampled at upstream- and downstream-bar positions (80 sites) in order to reveal hyporheic exchanges. At each site, 4 physico-chemical parameters were measured at 0, -20 and -50 cm beneath the sediment surface. The field collections of TIR high-resolution images were conducted concomitantly, at low flow and high surface-water temperatures. Among the 80 sites selected for field measurements, 14 were identified as upwellings (groundwater inputs) and 66 as downwelling sites. From those 14 upwellings, 13 were also identified with TIR. The 44 additional sites identified with TIR corresponded to small-sized cold-water patches situated along the gravel bars or to groundwater discharge sites located between the bars (19 lateral seeps). Nevertheless, the DHM method documented on downwelling exchanges (infiltration of surface water), which were not captured by TIR images, and may represent hyporheic hotspots especially for benthic invertebrates. Along the studied sector of the Ain River, these downwelling zones were much more numerous than upwelling ones. Both methods in combination provide a rather complete picture of water exchange along rivers and are needed to evaluate the potential as refuges zones during critical dry periods.

10,"Gomez-Velez, JD",Sep 28 2014 ,A hydrogeomorphic river network model predicts where and why hyporheic exchange is important in large basins,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Hyporheic exchange has been hypothesized to have basin-scale consequences; however, predictions throughout river networks are limited by available geomorphic and hydrogeologic data and by models that can analyze and aggregate hyporheic exchange flows across large spatial scales. We developed a parsimonious but physically based model of hyporheic flow for application in large river basins: Networks with EXchange and Subsurface Storage (NEXSS). We applied NEXSS across a broad range of geomorphic diversity in river reaches and synthetic river networks. NEXSS demonstrates that vertical exchange beneath submerged bed forms rather than lateral exchange through meanders dominates hyporheic fluxes and turnover rates along river corridors. Per kilometer, low-order streams have a biogeochemical potential at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than higher-order streams. However, when biogeochemical potential is examined per average length of each stream order, low-and high-order streams were often found to be comparable. As a result, the hyporheic zone's intrinsic potential for biogeochemical transformations is comparable across different stream orders, but the greater river miles and larger total streambed area of lower order streams result in the highest cumulative impact from low-order streams. Lateral exchange through meander banks may be important in some cases but generally only in large rivers.Show less"
11,"Chen, XB",Jun 2018 ,Hyporheic Exchange Driven by Three-Dimensional Sandy Bed Forms: Sensitivity to and Prediction from Bed Form Geometry,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bed form-driven hyporheic exchange is vital to biogeochemical processes occurring within aquatic sediment. The integrated effects of hyporheic processes in a bed form ultimately impact watershed-scale water quality. However, much of what is understood regarding bed hyporheic exchange is based on idealized two-dimensional bed forms despite the prevalence of potentially complex three-dimensional (3-D) bed forms in sandy riverbeds. We thus examined the impact of bed form three-dimensionality on hyporheic exchange. Bed form three-dimensionality was represented by two groups of geometric parameters: (1) crest planform curvature and (2) transverse and longitudinal wavelength and amplitude. A wide variety of synthetic bed forms was generated based on the geometric parameters. Then, surface flow over and hyporheic flow through each bed form was calculated using a 3-D multiphysics computational fluid dynamics model implemented across a range of Reynolds Number. We found that hyporheic exchange is sensitive to both types of parameters that determine the bed form three-dimensionality. Hyporheic exchange is dominated however by the three-dimensionality caused by out-of-phase superimposed sinusoidal surfaces. The results of the complex flow models were synthesized into simple equations for predicting hyporheic flux and bulk residence time based on bed form longitudinal and transverse wavelengths, bed form height, and Reynolds Number.Show less"
12,"Wagner, FH",Aug 1 2005 ,Does carbon enrichment affect hyporheic invertebrates in a gravel stream?,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"For a period of one year we injected a solution of stream water enriched with glucose and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus at two experimental sites into the hyporheic sediments of the Oberer Seebach, Austria. The biofilm reacted with a quantitative increase after two weeks. The hyporheic invertebrates were sampled with the Cage Pipe Trap method, where the number of trapped animals is determined by the spatial density and the activity of the invertebrates. Within two and six weeks, the hyporheic invertebrates exhibited a reaction indicating an utilization of the new food resources. Over a longer period of one year, three different reaction patterns appeared. The number of nematods and ostracods increased extensively, presumably caused by the modification of the spatial structure of the environment due to biofilm growth. The number of the small sized invertebrates decreased, reflecting the reduced feeding effort. And the number of the large insect larvae increased indicating that these group is mainly limited by space. The hyporheic zone is described as a 'self-cleaning DOC filter', an attribute that is particularly assigned to the ecotone between the riparian soil zone and the stream hyporheic zone.Show less"
13,"Wondzell, SM",Jan 15 2009 ,Evaluation of alternative groundwater flow models for simulating hyporheic exchange in a small mountain stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Groundwater flow models have been used to estimate the amount of exchange flow and the residence time distribution of stream water in the hyporheic zone. However, reliability of these predictions have not been tested. We ask the questions: (1) how reliable are hyporheic groundwater models in typical applications examining hyporheic exchange flows? and (2) how does the reliability change with increased data availability and model sophistication? We developed groundwater flow models of the hyporheic zone for a mountain stream in the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon. The models are based on surveyed topography and hydraulic conductivity (K) measurements from both slug tests and a well-to-well tracer test. We developed several models using different methods to estimate two of the most uncertain parameters - K and the depth and shape of the bedrock boundary. We first tested the goodness of fit of each model to the water levels observed in a network of wells and piezometers. Results showed that differences among models in predicted heads were quite small, whereas differences among estimated hyporheic fluxes varied by a factor of two. We then tested the model predictions of tracer arrival times to each well in the network during a stream-tracer injection. Comparison of simulated and observed travel times showed that increased model sophistication did not lead to improved model reliability, because travel time predictions from the homogeneous model were equal to, or better than, the predictions from the heterogeneous models. While general trends in solute breakthrough were correct in the models, K data from even 37 wells in a 15 m by 50 m model domain were insufficient to characterize detailed arrival times accurately. This suggests that geomorphic data may be sufficient to predict water fluxes through the subsurface and approximate travel times. However, for detailed analysis of solute transport pathways and breakthroughs, intensive sampling of the subsurface may be necessary. Published by Elsevier B.V.Show less"
14,"Fellows, CS",May 2001 ,Whole-stream metabolism in two montane streams: Contribution of the hyporheic zone,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"We used whole-stream and benthic chamber methods to measure rates of metabolism and determine the contribution of the hyporheic zone to ecosystem respiration (R) in two streams with differing surface-subsurface exchange characteristics, Rio Calaveras and Gallina Creek, New Mexico. We used the difference between whole-stream and benthic R to calculate the rate of hyporheic zone R and coupled this estimate to an independent measure of hyporheic sediment R to estimate the cross-sectional area of the hyporheic zone (A(H)) for two reaches from each stream. Conservative tracer injections and solute transport modeling were used to characterize surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange by determining values of the cross-sectional area of the transient storage zone (A(s)). The hyporheic zone contributed a substantial proportion of whole-stream R in all four study reaches, ranging from 40 to 93%. Whole stream R, hyporheic R, and percent contribution of hyporheic R all increased as transient storage increased, with whole-stream and hyporheic R exhibiting significant relationships with A(s). All three measures of respiration and values of A(H) were much greater for both reaches of the stream with greater surface-subsurface exchange. A(H) is valuable for cross-site comparisons because it accounts for differences in rates of both benthic and hyporheic sediment R and can be used to predict the importance of the hyporheic zone to other stream ecosystem processes.Show less"
15,"Rosenberry, DO",Feb 15 2012 ,In situ quantification of spatial and temporal variability of hyporheic exchange in static and mobile gravel-bed rivers,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Seepage meters modified for use in flowing water were used to directly measure rates of exchange between surface and subsurface water in a gravel- and cobble bed river in western Pennsylvania, USA (Allegheny River, Qmean = 190 m(3)/s) and a sand- and gravel-bed river in Colorado, USA (South Platte River, Qmean = 9.7 m(3)/s). Study reaches at the Allegheny River were located downstream from a dam. The bed was stable with moss, algae, and river grass present in many locations. Median seepage was + 0.28 m/d and seepage was highly variable among measurement locations. Upward and downward seepage greatly exceeded the median seepage rate, ranging from + 2.26 (upward) to - 3.76 (downward) m/d. At the South Platte River site, substantial local-scale bed topography as well as mobile bedforms resulted in spatial and temporal variability in seepage greatly in exceedence of the median groundwater discharge rate of 0.24 m/d. Both upward and downward seepage were recorded along every transect across the river with rates ranging from + 2.37 to - 3.40 m/d. Despite a stable bed, which commonly facilitates clogging by fine-grained or organic sediments, seepage rates at the Allegheny River were not reduced relative to those at the South Platte River. Seepage rate and direction depended primarily on measurement position relative to local- and meso-scale bed topography at both rivers. Hydraulic gradients were small at nearly all seepage-measurement locations and commonly were not a good indicator of seepage rate or direction. Therefore, measuring hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity at in-stream piezometers may be misleading if used to determine seepage flux across the sediment-water interface. Such a method assumes that flow between the well screen and sediment-water interface is vertical, which appears to be a poor assumption in coarse-grained hyporheic settings.

16,"Lu, CP",Jul 2018 ,Experimental study on hyporheic flow varied by the clay lens and stream flow,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Hyporheic exchange is one of the important physical processes that affect the flow condition of surface water-groundwater interaction zone, the restoration of water environment and the maintenance of ecological balance. The influence mechanism of clay lens on hyporheic exchange has not been well revealed by now. A two-dimensional sand tank was constructed to study the influence of low permeable clay lens on the hyporheic zone under different surface flow conditions. Experimental results showed that the influence of clay lens on the hyporheic zone was of direction dependent and influenced by the size and location of clay lens and stream flow. The influence of clay lens on hyporheic exchange is not only hindering, but also enhancement at certain conditions. With the increase of the depth of clay lens, the hyporheic flow affected by clay lens show three patterns: inhibition, enhancement, and stability. Moreover, these effects were gradually weakened with the increase of stream flow. Hyporheic flow around the clay lens was more sensitive while the surface flow is at a relative small rate. The increasing of the clay lens length weakened the infiltration of surface water and the upwelling of groundwater. The joint action of surface water and groundwater is one of the important control conditions, and that will affect the clay lens to change the hyporheic exchange significantly.Show less"
17,"Harjung, A",Jan 2018 ,Hydrological connectivity drives dissolved organic matter processing in an intermittent stream,LIMNOLOGICA,"Hydrological conditions are key drivers of dissolved organic matter (DOM) processing in intermittent streams. However, there still exist major gaps in knowledge regarding the temporal dynamics of DOM processing during drought periods, as well as the role of the hyporheic zone (HZ). We conducted weekly sampling of surface water and hyporheic pore water during a drying/rewetting cycle and characterized DOM by fluorescence and absorbance properties. Overall, the contribution of allochthonous and humic-like DOM increased during base flow in early summer (pre-drought) and continued increasing throughout the drought period, which covered three phases: contraction, fragmentation and dry. The contribution of autochthonous DOM during this period was restricted to very specific points in time (the transition from contraction to fragmentation phase) and space (the HZ). Hydrological connectivity between the HZ and the surface water was a driver of DOM composition by supplying terrestrial, aromatic DOM to the HZ. The disconnection of the stream from the riparian groundwater enabled us to quantify the DOM retention/release in the HZ. DOM mass balance at the stream-hyporheic interface revealed the occurrence of two time periods with disproportionately high rates for DOM processing (hot moments) during the study period: (1) a short pulse of protein-like, autochthonous DOM net release at the beginning of the disconnection; and (2) a longer time period of increasing net dissolved organic carbon (DOC) retention up to 30% along 25 m of HZ length during fragmentation and dry phase. Remarkably, the net carbon retention was coupled to a decrease of aromatic and high molecular weight compounds, while protein-like, autochthonous DOM was released. This result evidenced that under drought conditions, the HZ becomes a sink for DOM compounds previously assumed to be recalcitrant in aquatic ecosystems and therefore highlights the importance of hydrological drivers on DOM processing.

18,"Iepure, S",Nov 2022 ,Applying Electrical Resistivity Tomography and Biological Methods to Assess the Hyporheic Zone Water Exchanges in Two Mediterranean Stream Reaches,WATER,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is a critical area of all river ecosystems. It is the area beneath the stream and adjacent to the stream, where the surface water and groundwater are mixed. The HZ extends both vertically and laterally depending on the sediment configuration, namely their porosity and permeability. This influences the hyporheic communities' structural pattern and their active dispersal among distinct rivers compartments and alluvial aquifers. It is still difficult to assess the spatial extent of the HZ and the distribution of the mixing zones. This study applies time-lapse images obtained using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) of 20 m wide and 5 m deep alluvial streams, with regards to the structural pattern of hyporheic communities represented by cyclopoids and ostracods, in order to assess the extent of the HZ in the riverbed and the parafluvial sediment configurations. The ERT images obtained at the hyporheic Site 1 are characterized by alluvial deposits dominated by coarse and very coarse sands with resistivity values ranging from similar to 20 to 80 Ohm.m, indicating a permeable zone up to similar to 0.5 m thick and extending laterally for ca. 5 m from the channel and associated with the hyporheic zone. The sediment configurations, texture, and structure indicate an active surface-hyporheic water exchange and low water retention into the sediments. This is also indicated by the hyporheic copepods and ostracods communities' structure formed by a mixture of non-stygobites (five species) and stygobites (two species). A low-resistivity (<70 Ohm.m) permeable zone located 2.3 m below the streambed and unconnected with the river channel was also detected and associated with the associated alluvial aquifer. In contrast, the resistivity image at Site 2 dominated by coarse, medium, and very fine sands, shows a low-permeability zone in the upper similar to 0.5 m of the profile, with a resistivity value ranging from similar to 45 to 80 Ohm.m, indicating a reduced HZ extension in both vertical and lateral dimensions. Here the sediment configurations indicate that the water retention and interaction with the sediment is higher, reflected by more diverse hyporheic communities and with highly abundant stygobite species. The two examples show that non-invasive ERT images and biological assessments provide complementary and valuable information about the characterization of the sub-channel architecture and its potential hydraulic connection to the floodplain aquifer.Show less"

Our goal was to understand how active layer extent and stream geomorphology influence hyporheic exchange and nutrient chemistry. We studied two arctic tundra streams of contrasting geomorphology: a high-gradient, alluvial stream with riffle-pool sequences and a low-gradient, peat-bottomed stream with large deep pools connected by deep runs. Hyporheic exchange occurred to similar to 50 cm beneath the alluvial streambed and to only similar to 15 cm beneath the peat streambed. The thaw bulb was deeper than the hyporheic exchange zone in both stream types. The hyporheic zone was a net source of ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus in both stream types. The hyporheic zone was a net source of nitrate in the alluvial stream, but a net nitrate sink in the peat stream. The mass flux of nutrients regenerated from the hyporheic zones in these two streams was a small portion of the surface water mass flux. Although small, hyporheic sources of regenerated nutrients help maintain the in-stream nutrient balance. If future warming in the arctic increases the depth of the thaw bulb, it may not increase the vertical extent of hyporheic exchange. The greater impacts on annual contributions of hyporheic regeneration are likely to be due to longer thawed seasons, increased sediment temperatures or changes in geomorphology.Show less"

We recently completed a field study that suggested channel unit spacing in stream longitudinal profiles can be used to predict the spacing between zones of upwelling (flux of hyporheic water into the stream) and downwelling (flux of stream water into the hyporheic zone) in the beds of mountain streams. Here, we use two-dimensional groundwater flow and particle tracking models to simulate vertical and longitudinal hyporheic exchange along the longitudinal axis of stream flow in second-, third-, and fourth-order mountain stream reaches. Modelling allowed us to (1) represent visually the effect that the shape of the longitudinal profile has on the flow net beneath streambeds: (2) isolate channel unit sequence and spacing as individual factors controlling the depth that stream water penetrates the hyporheic zone and the length of upwelling and downwelling zones: (3) evaluate the degree to which the effects of regular patterns in bedform size and sequence are masked by irregularities in real streams. We simulated hyporheic exchange in two sets of idealized stream reaches and one set of observed stream reaches. Idealized profiles were constructed using regression equations relating channel form to basin area. The size and length of channel units (step size, pool length. etc.) increased with increasing stream order. Simulations of hyporheic exchange flows in these reaches suggested that upwelling lengths increased (from 2.7 m to 7.6 m), and downwelling lengths increased (from 2.9 m to 6-0 m) with increase in stream order from second to fourth order. Step spacing in the idealized reaches increased from 5-3 m to 13.7 m as stream size increased from second to fourth order. Simulated downwelling lengths increased from 4.3 m in second-order streams to 9.7 m in fourth-order streams with a POOL-RIFFLE -STEP channel unit sequence, and increased from 2.5 m to 6.1 m from second- to fourth-order streams with a POOL-STEP-RIFFLE channel unit sequence. Upwelling lengths also increased with stream order in these idealized channels. Our results suggest that channel unit spacing, size, and sequence are all important in determining hyporheic exchange patterns of upwelling and downwelling. Though irregularities in the size and spacing of bedforms caused flow nets to be much more complex in surveyed stream reaches than in idealized stream reaches, similar trends ernerged relating the average geomorphic wavelength to the average hyporheic wavelength in both surveyed and idealized reaches.

Yet stream ecologists have been slow to adopt nuanced hydrologic frameworks developed and applied by engineers and hydrologists to describe the relationship between water storage, water age, and water balance in finite hydrosystems such as hyporheic zones. Here, in the context of hyporheic hydrology, we summarize a well-established mathematical framework useful for describing hyporheic hydrology, while also applying the framework heuristically to visualize the relationships between water age, rates of hyporheic exchange, and water volume within hyporheic zones. Building on this heuristic application, we discuss how improved accuracy in the conceptualization of hyporheic exchange can yield a deeper understanding of the role of the hyporheic zone in stream ecosystems. Although the equations presented here have been well-described for decades, our aim is to make the mathematical basis as accessible as possible and to encourage broader understanding among aquatic ecologists of the implications of tailed age distributions commonly observed in water discharged from and stored within hyporheic zones. Our quantitative description of ""hyporheic hydraulic geometry,"" associated visualizations, and discussion offer a nuanced and realistic understanding of hyporheic hydrology to aid in considering hyporheic exchange in the context of river and stream ecosystem science and management.Show less"

We illustrate this relationship using two case studies from very different lotic ecosystems: a large mesic river in France and an intermittent desert stream in Arizona. In both cases, there are strong correlations between direction and magnitude of hydrologic fluxes and the composition of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages. Hydrologists are likely to find that the distribution and abundance of hyporheos will provide useful corroborative data in studies of hyporheic flow dynamics, while ecologists should recognize the effects of hydrologic exchange between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone at a variety of scales. Thus hydrologic measurements of surface water and ground-water exchange should be included routinely in future studies of hyporheic invertebrate ecology. Such exchange controls the availability of nutrients, food, and dissolved gases to the hyporheos and indicates a mechanism whereby the subsurface component influences processes occurring in the rest of the lotic ecosystem.Show less"
24,"LeFebvre, S",Sep 2004 ,Stream regulation and nitrogen dynamics in sediment interstices: Comparison of natural and straightened sectors of a third-order stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Nitrogen dynamics were studied in the interstitial environment (i.e. hyporheic zone) of a sandy-bottom stream in a rural landscape. A third-order stream in Brittany (France) was studied at 11 stations (riffles) to evaluate spatial patterns of water exchange between surface and interstitial habitats. More intensive sampling was conducted in three riffles selected according to their hydrological characteristics. Chemical characteristics (especially nitrogen) and microbial denitrification were studied at 12.5 and 25 cm depth upstream, and 25 cm depth downstream of each riffle. This study confirms that the interstitial habitat of a N-rich stream acts as a sink for the nitrate-nitrogen. Experimental manipulation of sediment cores indicates that denitrification is limited by carbon in surface (i.e. benthic) and by nitrate in hyporheic sediments. River regulation increases inputs of fine sediments, modifies river channel location, and generates changes in the spatial patterns of biogeochemical processes, water origins, and hydrologic exchanges.

25,"Malcolm, IA",Feb 28 2003 ,Heterogeneity in ground water-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone of a salmonid spawning stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Spatial and temporal variability in ground water-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone of a salmonid spawning stream was investigated. Four locations in a 150-m reach of the stream were studied using hydrometric and hydrochemical tracing techniques. A high degree of hydrological connectivity between the riparian hillslope and the stream channel was indicated at two locations, where hydrochemical changes and hydraulic gradients indicated that the hyporheic zone was dominated by upwelling ground water. The chemistry of ground water reflected relatively long residence times and reducing conditions with high levels of alkalinity and conductivity, low dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate. At the other locations, connectivity was less evident and, at most times, the hyporheic zone was dominated by downwelling stream water characterized by high DO, low alkalinity and conductivity. Substantial variability in hyporheic chemistry was evident at fine (<10 m) spatial scales and changed rapidly over the course of hydrological events. The nature of the hydrochemical response varied among locations depending on the strength of local ground water influence. It is suggested that greater emphasis on spatial and temporal heterogeneity in ground water-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone is necessary for a consideration of hydrochemical effects on many aspects of stream ecology. For example, the survival of salmonid eggs in hyporheic gravels varied considerably among the locations studied and was shown to be associated with variation in interstitial chemistry. River restoration schemes and watershed management strategies based only on the surface expression of catchment characteristics risk excluding consideration of potentially critical subsurface processes.

26,"Sherman, T",Mar 2019 ,A Dual Domain stochastic lagrangian model for predicting transport in open channels with hyporheic exchange,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The exchange of surface and subsurface waters plays an important role in understanding and predicting large scale transport processes in streams and rivers. Accurately capturing the influence of small-scale features associated with turbulent dispersion on exchange in an upscaled framework is necessary for developing reliable predictive models at the reach scale. In this work, we use high-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) to fully resolve turbulent flow and hyporheic exchange in an open channel. We parameterize a 2D particle tracking model with the average DNS velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles. Breakthrough curves and rate of surface mass loss to the subsurface in both models agree after a sufficient distance downstream from particle injection. Finally we find that the travel time/distance joint pdf contains enough information to parameterize a 1D dual domain coupled Continuous Time Random Walk (ddc-CTRW) model that successfully reproduces the behavior of both the DNS and the 2D particle tracking model, allowing accurate prediction of breakthrough curves. Predicting breakthrough curves with a fully parameterized ddc-CTRW reduces cpu time by orders of magnitude when compared with DNS.Show less"
27,"Krause, S",Mar 2022 ,Organizational Principles of Hyporheic Exchange Flow and Biogeochemical Cycling in River Networks Across Scales,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic zones increase freshwater ecosystem resilience to hydrological extremes and global environmental change. However, current conceptualizations of hyporheic exchange, residence time distributions, and the associated biogeochemical cycling in streambed sediments do not always accurately explain the hydrological and biogeochemical complexity observed in streams and rivers. Specifically, existing conceptual models insufficiently represent the coupled transport and reactivity along groundwater and surface water flow paths, the role of autochthonous organic matter in streambed biogeochemical functioning, and the feedbacks between surface-subsurface ecological processes, both within and across spatial and temporal scales. While simplified approaches to these issues are justifiable and necessary for transferability, the exclusion of important hyporheic processes from our conceptualizations can lead to erroneous conclusions and inadequate understanding and management of interconnected surface water and groundwater environments. This is particularly true at the landscape scale, where the organizational principles of spatio-temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) and biogeochemical processes remain largely uncharacterized. This article seeks to identify the most important drivers and controls of HEF and biogeochemical cycling based on a comprehensive synthesis of findings from a wide range of river systems. We use these observations to test current paradigms and conceptual models, discussing the interactions of local-to-regional hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological controls of hyporheic zone functioning. This improved conceptualization of the landscape organizational principles of drivers of HEF and biogeochemical processes from reach to catchment scales will inform future river research directions and watershed management strategies.Show less"
28,"Lv, JZ",Nov 2022 ,Numerical simulation of hyporheic exchange driven by an emergent vegetation patch,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Vegetation patches increase the pressure gradient of local channels and can create an uneven pressure distribution at the water-sediment interface, thereby driving hyporheic exchange. However, this process has rarely been discussed. We investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of hyporheic exchange under the influence of multiple factors. A bidirectional coupling model of the overlying water and sediment with an emergent vegetation patch was adopted. The results show that hyporheic exchange driven by vegetation patches are spatially heterogeneous. The active area of hyporheic exchange was concentrated directly below the vegetation patch. A finger flow was formed at the edge of the active hyporheic exchange zone as the exchange took place. Furthermore, intermittent downward solute transport path (IDSTP) was formed downstream of the vegetation patch, and the exchange rate was one order of magnitude smaller than that of the hyporheic exchange active zone. Hyporheic exchange occurred at the stem and patch scales when the vegetation density was relatively high. There was a logarithmic relationship between the hyporheic exchange flux and sediment permeability, and a power function relationship existed between the hyporheic exchange flux and Reynolds number. The active area of hyporheic exchange will help predict pollutant transport and understand vegetation's nutrient absorption process. IDSTP will provide references for vegetation patch expansion.Show less"
29,"Song, JX",Sep 15 2017 ,Variability in the vertical hyporheic water exchange affected by hydraulic conductivity and river morphology at a natural confluent meander bend,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"River confluences and their associated tributaries are key morphodynamic nodes that play important roles in controlling hydraulic geometry and hyporheic water exchange in fluvial networks. However, the existing knowledge regarding hyporheic water exchange associated with river confluence morphology is relatively scarce. On January 14 and 15, 2016, the general hydraulic and morphological characteristics of the confluent meander bend (CMB) between the Juehe River and the Haohe River in the southern region of Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China, were investigated. The patterns and magnitudes of vertical hyporheic water exchange (VHWE) were estimated based on a one-dimensional heat steady-state model, whereas the sediment vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) was calculated via in situ permeameter tests. The results demonstrated that 6 hydrodynamic zones and their extensions were observed at the CMB during the test period. These zones were likely controlled by the obtuse junction angle and low momentum flux ratio, influencing the sediment grain size distribution of the CMB. The VHWE patterns at the test site during the test period mostly showed upwelling flow dominated by regional groundwater discharging into the river. The occurrence of longitudinal downwelling and upwelling patterns along the meander bend at the CMB was likely subjected to the comprehensive influences of the local sinuosity of the meander bend and regional groundwater discharge and finally formed regional and local flow paths. Additionally, in dominated upwelling areas, the change in VHWE magnitudes was nearly consistent with that in K-v values, and higher values of both variables generally occurred in erosional zones near the thalweg paths of the CMB, which were mostly made up of sand and gravel. This was potentially caused by the erosional and depositional processes subjected to confluence morphology. Furthermore, lower K-v values observed in downwelling areas at the CMB were attributed to sediment clogging caused by local downwelling flow. The confluence morphology and sediment K-v are thus likely the driving factors that cause local variations in the VHWE of fluvial systems.Show less"
30,"Long, SL",Mar 30 2014 ,Variation of stream temperature among mesoscale habitats within stream reaches: southern Appalachians,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream mesoscale habitats have systematic topographic relationships to hyporheic flow patterns, which may create predictable temperature variation between mesoscale habitat types. We investigated whether systematic differences in temperature metrics occurred between mesoscale habitats within reaches of small streams tributary to the upper Little Tennessee River, southern Appalachians. Surface water temperature was recorded over three or four mid-summer days in four mesoscale habitat types: riffle, main riffle, pool and alcove in 44 stream segments (sites). Temperature metrics were calculated for each mesoscale habitat relative to the mean value of the metric over the stream: maximum temperature, average maximum temperature and maximum daily variation and also for each site: standard deviation of the maximum temperature and average diurnal variation (ADV). Sites were categorized as fully or partially forested. Pool tailouts had statistically significantly lower maximum temperature and average maximum temperature than riffle tailouts in partially forested sites, although differences were small. This was the opposite of what was expected in the presence of hyporheic exchange, indicating hyporheic exchange is not a dominant driver of mesoscale habitat temperatures at these sites. Temperature differences between mesoscale habitat units were small and unlikely to have ecological significance. We also evaluated relationships between stream temperature and riparian condition, watershed % impervious surfaces, watershed % non-forested and elevation. ADV and standard deviation of the maximum temperature were significantly higher in partially forested sites, indicating that partially forested sites have greater temperature ranges and spatial variation of maximum temperatures. ADV decreased with elevation and increased with % impervious surfaces. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
31,"Rana, SMM",May 2017 ,Effects of in-stream structures and channel flow rate variation on transient storage,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"In-stream structures can potentially enhance surface and subsurface solute retention. They form naturally in small streams and their installation has gained popularity in stream restoration for multiple purposes, including improved water quality. Yet few studies have quantified the cumulative effect of multiple structures on solute transport at the reach scale, nor how this varies with changing stream flow. We built a series of weirs in a small stream to simulate channel spanning structures such as natural debris dams and stream restoration log dams and boulder weirs. We conducted constant rate conservative (NaCl) tracer injections to quantify the effect of the weirs on solute transport at the reach scale. We used a one dimensional solute transport model with transient storage to quantify the change of solute transport parameters with increasing number of weirs. Results indicate that adding weirs significantly increased the cross-sectional area of the surface stream (A) and transient storage zones (A(s)) while exchange with transient storage (cc) decreased. The increase in A and As is due to backwater behind weirs and increased hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange induced by the weirs, while we surmise that the reduction in alpha is due at least in part to reduced hydrodynamically driven hyporheic exchange in bed ripples drowned by the weir backwater. In order for weir installation to achieve net improvement in solute retention and thus water quality, cumulative reactions in weir backwater and enhanced hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange would have to overcome the reduced hydrodynamically driven exchange. Analysis of channel flow variation over the course of the experiments indicated that weirs change the relationship between transient storage parameters and flow, for example the trend of increasing a with flow without weirs was reversed in the presence of weirs. Effects of flow variation were substantial, indicating that transient storage measurements at a single point in time typically cannot be extrapolated to estimate net annual effects. Thus, rigorous evaluation of water quality effects of stream restoration structures requires measurements at multiple channel flow rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
32,"TRISKA, FJ",Feb 5 1993 ,THE ROLE OF WATER EXCHANGE BETWEEN A STREAM CHANNEL AND ITS HYPORHEIC ZONE IN NITROGEN CYCLING AT THE TERRESTRIAL AQUATIC INTERFACE,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The subsurface riparian zone was examined as an ecotone with two interfaces. Inland is a terrestrial boundary, where transport of water and dissolved solutes is toward the channel and controlled by watershed hydrology. Streamside is an aquatic boundary, where exchange of surface water and dissolved solutes is bi-directional and flux is strongly influenced by channel hydraulics. Streamside, bi-directional exchange of water was qualitatively defined using biologically conservative tracers in a third order stream. In several experiments, penetration of surface water extended 18 m inland. Travel time of water from the channel to bankside sediments was highly variable. Subsurface chemical gradients were indirectly related to the travel time. Sites with long travel times tended to be low in nitrate and DO (dissolved oxygen) but high in ammonium and DOC (dissolved organic carbon). Sites with short travel times tended to be high in nitrate and DO but low in ammonium and DOC. Ammonium concentration of interstitial water also was influenced by sorption-desorption processes that involved clay minerals in hyporheic sediments. Denitrification potential in subsurface sediments increased with distance from the channel, and was limited by nitrate at inland sites and by DO in the channel sediments. Conversely, nitrification potential decreased with distance from the channel, and was limited by DO at inland sites and by ammonium at channel locations. Advection of water and dissolved oxygen away from the channel resulted in an oxidized subsurface habitat equivalent to that previously defined as the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone is viewed as stream habitat because of its high proportion of surface water and the occurrence of channel organisms. Beyond the channel's hydrologic exchange zone, interstitial water is often chemically reduced. Interstitial water that has not previously entered the channel, groundwater, is viewed as a terrestrial component of the riparian ecotone. Thus, surface water habitats may extend under riparian vegetation, and terrestrial groundwater habitats may be found beneath the stream channel.Show less"

We parameterized the model using a Continuous map of surface water stage derived from LIDAR remote sensing data. Model results reveal the presence of complex spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange across spatial scales. We use simulation results to describe streams as a collection of hierarchically organized, individual flow paths that spiral across ecotones within streams and knit tooether sti-carn ecosystems. Such a vie"", underscores the importance of: (1) gross hyporheic exchange rates in rivers, (2) the differing ecological roles of short and long hyporheic flow paths. and (3) the downstream movement of water and solutes outside of the stream channel (e.g. in the alluvial aquifer). Hydrologic spirals underscore important limitations of empirical measures of biotic solute uptake from streams and provide a needed hydrologic framework for emerging research foci in stream ecology Such as hydrologic connectivity. spatial and temporal variation in biogeochemical cycling rates and the role of stream geomorphology as a dominant control on stream ecosystem dynamics.

Many studies have investigated use of the hyporheic refugium during hydrological extremes (spates and streambed drying), and recent research has linked an increase in the abundance of benthic invertebrates within hyporheic sediments to increasing biotic interactions during flow recession in a temporary stream. This study examined spatial variability in the refugial capacity of the hyporheic zone in two groundwater-dominated streams in which flow permanence varied over small areas. Two non-insect taxa, Commands pulex and Polycelis spp. were common to both streams and were investigated in detail. Hydrological conditions in both streams comprised a four-month period of flow recession and low flows, accompanied by reductions in water depth and wetted width. Consequent declines in submerged benthic habitat availability were associated with increases in population densities of mobile benthic taxa, in particular G. pulex. The reduction in the spatial extent of the hyporheic zone was minimal, and this habitat was therefore a potential refugium from increasing biotic interactions in the benthic sediments. Concurrent increases in the hyporheic abundance and hyporheic proportion of a taxon's total (benthic + hyporheic) population were considered as evidence of active refugium use. Such evidence was species-specific and site-specific, with refugium use being observed only for G. pulex and at sites dominated by downwelling water. A conceptual model of spatial variability in the refugial capacity of the hyporheic zone during habitat contraction is presented, which highlights the potential importance of the direction of hydrologic exchange.Show less"
36,"Sawyer, AH",Aug 3 2011 ,Hyporheic exchange due to channel-spanning logs,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The flow of river water around large woody debris (LWD) creates pressure gradients along the riverbed that drive a large zone of river-groundwater mixing, or hyporheic exchange. Flume experiments and numerical simulations show that river water downwells into the riverbed upstream of a channel-spanning log and upwells downstream. Exchange rates are greatest near the log and decay exponentially with distance upstream and downstream. We developed equations for bed pressure profiles and hyporheic exchange rates in the vicinity of a channel-spanning log that can be used to evaluate the impact of LWD removal or reintroduction on hyporheic mixing. The magnitude of pressure disturbance along the bed (and thus hyporheic exchange) increases with the fraction of channel depth blocked by the log and channel Froude number. Exchange rates are relatively insensitive to relative depth of the log (gap ratio). At natural densities, LWD in lowland streams drives reach-averaged hyporheic exchange rates similar to a ripple-covered bed. However, the length scales and residence times of hyporheic exchange due to LWD are greater. By removing LWD from streams, humans have altered patterns and rates of hyporheic exchange, which influence habitat distribution and quality for invertebrates and fish.Show less"

The present study examined the effect of an artificially constructed gravel bar and re- meandered stream channel on lateral hyporheic exchange flow and chemistry in two lowland N- rich streams in southern Ontario, Canada. Nitrate concentrations were relatively high, ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg N/ l in both streams during spring through fall months. However, nitrate concentrations showed a steep decline as stream water entered the gravel bar and the meander bends. Differences between observed and predicted nitrate concentrations based on conservative ion concentration patterns indicated that 40- 100 and 68- 98% of the nitrate entering the hyporheic zone was removed in the gravel bar and meanders, respectively. Rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen concentrations along lateral hyporheic flow paths and denitrifying potentials assayed by the acetylene block technique in hyporheic sediments suggests that denitrification was an important mechanism of nitrate depletion. Despite the high rate of nitrate removal, the flux of stream water laterally entering the constructed gravel bar and meander bends was very small, and hyporheic nitrate removal was < 0.015% of the daily stream load during base- flow periods in summer and fall. The effects of restoration projects on hyporheic zone dynamics are often limited in lowland streams by low channel gradients and fine floodplain sediments with low interstitial flows that restrict the magnitude of the stream-hyporheic connection.Show less"
39,"Wilhelmsen, K",Sep 2021 ,Laboratory Flume and Numerical Modeling Experiments Show Log Jams and Branching Channels Increase Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Log jams alter gradients in hydraulic head, increase the area available for hyporheic exchange by creating backwater areas, and lead to the formation of multiple channel branches and bars that drive additional exchange. Here, we numerically simulated stream-groundwater interactions for two constructed flume systems-one without jams and one with a series of three jams-to quantify the effects of interacting jam structures and channel branches on hyporheic exchange at three stream flow rates. In simulations without jams, average hyporheic exchange rates ranged from 2.1 x 10(-4) to 2.9 x 10(-4) m/s for various stream discharge scenarios, but with jams, exchange rates increased to a range of 1.3 x 10(-3)-3.5 x 10(-3) m/s. Largely due to these increased hyporheic exchange rates, jams increased stream-groundwater connectivity or decreased the turnover length that stream water travels before interacting with the hyporheic zone, by an order of magnitude, and drove long flow paths that connected multiple jams and channel threads. Decreased turnover lengths corresponded with greater reaction significance per km, a measure of the potential for the hyporheic zone to influence stream water chemistry. For low-flow conditions, log jams increased reaction significance per km five-fold, from 0.07 to 0.35. Jams with larger volumes led to longer hyporheic residence times and path lengths that exhibited multiple scales of exchange. Additionally, the longest flow paths connecting multiple jams occurred in the reach with multiple channel branches. These findings suggest that large gains in hydrologic connectivity can be achieved by promoting in-stream wood accumulation and the natural formation of both jams and branching channels.Show less"
40,"Sawyer, AH",Oct 23 2012 ,Effect of experimental wood addition on hyporheic exchange and thermal dynamics in a losing meadow stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream restoration structures such as large wood can enhance shallow river-groundwater exchange, or hyporheic exchange, and alter temperature dynamics in restored reaches. We added and then removed channel-spanning logs in a second-order mountain meadow stream to test short-term impacts on hyporheic exchange, streambed temperatures, and surface water temperatures. Based on vertical seepage measurements and numerical simulations of hyporheic fluid and heat flow, large wood addition increased hyporheic exchange and altered streambed temperatures. In this losing stream, meter-scale hyporheic exchange cells formed beneath large wood. Upwelling pore water downstream of logs stabilized diel temperature cycles across <8% of the streambed, creating localized but potentially valuable thermal refuge. Exchange rates were <0.1% of channel discharge-too small to impact the range of diel temperature signals in surface water. However, the lag between downstream and upstream diel temperature signals was slightly greater with large wood, which may indicate that surface storage zones rather than hyporheic storage zones increased thermal retardation. Losing conditions limited the spatial extent and rates of hyporheic exchange near large wood. Impacts of large wood reintroduction on hyporheic exchange depend on ambient groundwater discharge or recharge, streambed permeability, channel Froude number, large wood blockage ratio, and large wood spacing. In many streams, large wood reintroduction may increase hyporheic habitat volume and complexity but may not increase exchange rates enough to alter surface water temperature or chemistry. Surface storage zones such as eddies and pools can still influence heat and solute retention in the channel.Show less"
41,"Hester, ET",Jun 2019 ,Effect of Surface Water Stage Fluctuation on Mixing-Dependent Hyporheic Denitrification in Riverbed Dunes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone, where surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) interact in shallow sediments beneath rivers, is uniquely reactive and attenuates pollutants. Mixing of reactants from SW and GW enables mixing-dependent (MD) reactions, which may be the last opportunity for GW contaminants to react before entering SW. Yet little is known about hyporheic MD reactions, particularly how they respond to daily or seasonal SW fluctuations or sediment heterogeneity. We used MODFLOW and SEAM3D to simulate non-mixing-dependent (NMD) aerobic respiration and MD denitrification in a riverbed dune with nitrate from SW and dissolved organic carbon from GW. We varied SW heads and heterogeneity of sediment hydraulic conductivity. For longer-term fluctuations (i.e., seasons), increasing SW depth from 0.1 to 1.0 m increased NMD aerobic respiration by 270% and MD denitrification by 78% in homogeneous sediment. MD reactions thus were controlled by mixing zone length or size and would be stronger when SW stage is elevated, for example, during wintertime. Adding sediment heterogeneity to the long-term scenarios, particularly by increasing hydraulic conductivity correlation length, increased flow focusing and consequently increased MD denitrification by 20-30%. By contrast, the net effect of daily SW fluctuations on MD denitrification in homogeneous sediment was minor. In sum, SW fluctuations are an important control on hyporheic MD reactions, primarily by controlling mixing zone length. The hyporheic zone may attenuate nitrate in upwelling GW plumes, but temporal fluctuations may be considerable as quantified above.Show less"
42,"Pacioglu, O",Mar 2016 ,Response of invertebrates from the hyporheic zone of chalk rivers to eutrophication and land use,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Whereas the response of lotic benthic macroinvertebrates to different environmental stressors is a widespread practice nowadays in assessing the water and habitat quality, the use of hyporheic zone invertebrates is still in its infancy. In this study, classification and regression trees analysis were employed in order to assess the ecological requirements and the potential as bioindicators for the hyporheic zone invertebrates inhabiting four lowland chalk rivers (south England) with contrasting eutrophication levels (based on surface nitrate concentrations) and magnitude of land use (based on percentage of fine sediments load and median interstitial space). Samples of fauna, water and sediment were sampled twice, during low (summer) and high (winter) groundwater level, at depths of 20 and 35 cm. Certain groups of invertebrates (Glossosomatidae and Psychomyiidae caddisflies, and riffle beetles) proved to be good indicators of rural catchments, moderately eutrophic and with high fine sediment load. A diverse community dominated by microcrustaceans (cope-pods and ostracods) were found as good indicators of highly eutrophic urban streams, with moderate-high fine sediment load. However, the use of other taxonomic groups (e.g. chironomids, oligochaetes, nematodes, water mites and the amphipod Gammarus pulex), very widespread in the hyporheic zone of all sampled rivers, is of limited use because of their high tolerance to the analysed stressors. We recommend the use of certain taxonomic groups (comprising both meiofauna and macroinvertebrates) dwelling in the chalk hyporheic zone as indicators of eutrophication and colmation and, along with routine benthic sampling protocols, for a more comprehensive water and habitat quality assessment of chalk rivers.Show less"
43,"Hoagland, B",Dec 11 2020 ,Groundwater-Stream Connectivity Mediates Metal(loid) Geochemistry in the Hyporheic Zone of Streams Impacted by Historic Mining and Acid Rock Drainage,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"High concentrations of trace metal(loid)s exported from abandoned mine wastes and acid rock drainage pose a risk to the health of aquatic ecosystems. To determine if and when the hyporheic zone mediates metal(loid) export, we investigated the relationship between streamflow, groundwater-stream connectivity, and subsurface metal(loid) concentrations in two similar to 1-km stream reaches within the Bonita Peak Mining District, a US Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site located near Silverton, Colorado, USA. The hyporheic zones of reaches in two streams-Mineral Creek and Cement Creek-were characterized using a combination of salt-tracer injection tests, transient-storage modeling, and geochemical sampling of the shallow streambed (<0.7m). Based on these data, we present two conceptual models for subsurface metal(loid) behavior in the hyporheic zones, including (1) well-connected systems characterized by strong hyporheic mixing of infiltrating stream water and upwelling groundwater and (2) poorly connected systems delineated by physical barriers that limit hyporheic mixing. The comparatively large hyporheic zone and high hydraulic conductivities of Mineral Creek created a connected stream-groundwater system, where mixing of oxygen-rich stream water and metal-rich groundwater facilitated the precipitation of metal colloids in the shallow subsurface. In Cement Creek, the precipitation of iron oxides at depth (similar to 0.4m) created a low-hydraulic-conductivity barrier between surface water and groundwater. Cemented iron oxides were an important regulator of metal(loid) concentrations in this poorly connected stream-groundwater system due to the formation of strong redox gradients induced by a relatively small hyporheic zone and high fluid residence times. A comparison of conceptual models to streamconcentration-discharge relationships exhibited a clear link between geochemical processes occurring within the hyporheic zone of the well-connected system and export of particulate Al, Cu, Fe, and Mn, while the poorly connected system did not have a notable influence on metal concentration-discharge trends. Mineral Creek is an example of a hyporheic system that serves as a natural dissolved metal(loid) sink, whereas poorly connected systems such as Cement Creek may require a combination of subsurface remediation of sediments and mitigation of upstream, iron-rich mine drainages to reduce metal export.Show less"
44,"Pryshlak, TT",Nov 2015 ,Multiscale hyporheic exchange through strongly heterogeneous sediments,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity (K) and channel morphology both control surface water-groundwater exchange (hyporheic exchange), which influences stream ecosystem processes and bio-geochemical cycles. Here we show that heterogeneity in K is the dominant control on exchange rates, residence times, and patterns in hyporheic zones with abrupt lithologic contrasts. We simulated hyporheic exchange in a representative low-gradient stream with 300 different bimodal K fields composed of sand and silt. Simulations span five sets of sand-silt ratios and two sets of low and high K contrasts (1 and 3 orders of magnitude). Heterogeneity increases interfacial flux by an order of magnitude relative to homogeneous cases, drastically changes the shape of residence time distributions, and decreases median residence times. The positioning of highly permeable sand bodies controls patterns of interfacial flux and flow paths. These results are remarkably different from previous studies of smooth, continuous K fields that indicate only moderate effects on hyporheic exchange. Our results also show that hyporheic residence times are least predictable when sand body connectivity is low. As sand body connectivity increases, the expected residence time distribution (ensemble average for a given sand-silt ratio) remains approximately constant, but the uncertainty around the expectation decreases. Including strong heterogeneity in hyporheic models is imperative for understanding hyporheic fluxes and solute transport. In streams with strongly heterogeneous sediments, characterizing lithologic structure is more critical for predicting hyporheic exchange metrics than characterizing channel morphology.Show less"
45,"Martone, I",Mar 2020 ,"Characterization of Hyporheic Exchange Drivers and Patterns within a Low-Gradient, First-Order, River Confluence during Low and High Flow",WATER,"Confluences are nodes in riverine networks characterized by complex three-dimensional changes in flow hydrodynamics and riverbed morphology, and are valued for important ecological functions. This physical complexity is often investigated within the water column or riverbed, while few studies have focused on hyporheic fluxes, which is the mixing of surface water and groundwater across the riverbed. This study aims to understand how hyporheic flux across the riverbed is organized by confluence physical drivers. Field investigations were carried out at a low gradient, headwater confluence between Baltimore Brook and Cold Brook in Marcellus, New York, USA. The study measured channel bathymetry, hydraulic permeability, and vertical temperature profiles, as indicators of the hyporheic exchange due to temperature gradients. Confluence geometry, hydrodynamics, and morphodynamics were found to significantly affect hyporheic exchange rate and patterns. Local scale bed morphology, such as the confluence scour hole and minor topographic irregularities, influenced the distribution of bed pressure head and the related patterns of downwelling/upwelling. Furthermore, classical back-to-back bend planform and the related secondary circulation probably affected hyporheic exchange patterns around the confluence shear layer. Finally, even variations in the hydrological conditions played a role on hyporheic fluxes modifying confluence planform, and, in turn, flow circulation patterns.Show less"
46,"Hinkle, SR",Apr 20 2001 ,"Linking hyporheic flow and nitrogen cycling near the Willamette River - a large river in Oregon, USA",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Several approaches were used to characterize ground water/surface water interactions near the Willamette River - a large (ninth order) river in Oregon, USA. 4 series of potentiometric surface maps demonstrated the presence of highly dynamic hydraulic gradients between rivers and the adjacent aquifer. Hyporheic zone gradients extended on the order of hundreds of meters. River gains and losses at the river stretch scale (tens of kilometers) were consistent with fluxes implied by the potentiometric surface maps, and apparently reflect regional ground water/surface water interactions. Gains and losses of up to 5-10% of streamflow were observed at this scale. On the river reach scale (1-2 km), gains and losses on the order of 5% of streamflow were interpreted as representing primarily local hyporheic exchange.Isotopic and chemical data collected from shallow hyporheic zone wells demonstrated interaction between regional ground water and river water. The origin of sampled hyporheic zone water ranged from a mixture dominated by regional ground water to water containing 100% river water. The common assumption that ground and river water mix primarily in the river channel is not applicable in this system. Isotopic and chemical data also indicated that significant (nearly complete) vegetative nitrate uptake and/or nitrate reduction occurred in water from 4 of 12 hyporheic zone sites. Ln these cases, it was primarily nitrate transported to the hyporheic zone in regional ground water that was removed from solution. Isotopes of water and nitrate indicated that hyporheic zone water sampled at two sites was composed of water originating as river water and demonstrated that significant vegetative nitrate uptake and nitrate reduction occurred along these hyporheic zone flowpaths. Thus, the hyporheic zone may, in some instances, serve to remove nitrate from river water. Additional investigations with chemical tools and microbial enzyme assays were conducted at one hyporheic site. A strong vertical redox gradient was observed, with nitrate-limited denitrification potential in deeper sediment and both nitrification and denitrification potential in shallower sediment. Since nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by redox conditions, nitrogen cycling in the hyporheic zone of this large-river system likely is affected by dynamics of ground water/surface water interactions that control fluxes of nitrogen and other redox species to hyporheic zone sediment.

47,"Boano, F",Dec 2014 ,"Hyporheic flow and transport processes: Mechanisms, models, and biogeochemical implications",REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS,"Fifty years of hyporheic zone research have shown the important role played by the hyporheic zone as an interface between groundwater and surface waters. However, it is only in the last two decades that what began as an empirical science has become a mechanistic science devoted to modeling studies of the complex fluid dynamical and biogeochemical mechanisms occurring in the hyporheic zone. These efforts have led to the picture of surface-subsurface water interactions as regulators of the form and function of fluvial ecosystems. Rather than being isolated systems, surface water bodies continuously interact with the subsurface. Exploration of hyporheic zone processes has led to a new appreciation of their wide reaching consequences for water quality and stream ecology. Modern research aims toward a unified approach, in which processes occurring in the hyporheic zone are key elements for the appreciation, management, and restoration of the whole river environment. In this unifying context, this review summarizes results from modeling studies and field observations about flow and transport processes in the hyporheic zone and describes the theories proposed in hydrology and fluid dynamics developed to quantitatively model and predict the hyporheic transport of water, heat, and dissolved and suspended compounds from sediment grain scale up to the watershed scale. The implications of these processes for stream biogeochemistry and ecology are also discussed.Show less"
48,"FINDLAY, S",Jan 1995 ,IMPORTANCE OF SURFACE-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE IN STREAM ECOSYSTEMS - THE HYPORHEIC ZONE,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"In many streams, significant amounts of water are exchanged between saturated sediments surrounding the open channel (the hyporheic zone) and the channel itself. Such exchanges with the hyporheic zone have the potential to cause large changes in streamwater chemistry because the rates of biogeochemical processes and the actual types of processes (e.g. anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism) may be fundamentally different. I propose an organizational scheme for grouping stream systems into clusters of minimal, moderate, and maximal contribution of hyporheic metabolism to the overall ecosystem. Lack of information on quantitative hydrology for different stream systems prohibits actual testing of this framework. An alternative scheme is presented that organizes several well-studied streams as a function of subsurface residence time and differences in oxygen content. This second scheme is intended to stimulate discussion of conceptual frameworks for cross-system comparisons of the importance of hyporheic sediments in stream ecosystems.Show less"
49,"Wondzell, SM",Mar 15 2010 ,An analysis of alternative conceptual models relating hyporheic exchange flow to diel fluctuations in discharge during baseflow recession,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Diel fluctuations in stream flow during baseflow have been observed in many streams and are typically attributed to water losses from evapotranspiration (ET). However, there is no widely transferable conceptual model that explains how ET results in diel fluctuations in streamflow at the watershed outlet. For fluctuations to occur, two factors must be present: (1) some process must generate the fluctuations and transfer them to the stream channel, and (2) fluctuations must be accumulated and transported down the stream network in such a way that they arrive at a stream gauge as a coherent signal. We have previously shown how stream flow velocity affects the transport of diel fluctuations in discharge through a stream network. Here, we examined how riparian ET and hyporheic exchange flows generate diel fluctuations in discharge. We hypothesized that ET would cause a slight drawdown of riparian aquifers during the day, slightly increasing head gradients away from the stream and slightly reducing head gradients back to the stream. Thus, slightly more water would flow into the hyporheic zone than is returned to the stream, gradually reducing stream discharge. The process would be reversed at night. Using stream-tracer experiments and riparian water-level data, we tested two hypotheses related to this conceptual model-that the amplitude (H1) and time lag (H2) of diel aquifer drawdown would be constant over the summer. Neither hypothesis was supported by our data. We conclude that the processes that link watershed ET with streams include both local- and watershed-scale effects. Conceptual models attempting to explain diel fluctuations need to include the combined effects of ET on lateral inputs and hyporheic exchange flows, the redistribution of water within riparian aquifers, and the transport of ET signals from the whole stream network to the stream gauge.
