This study integrates two important concepts in floodplain hydrology; the flood pulse concept and the oxbow lake cycle. High temporal resolution (0.5-3.0 h) lake level data from vented pressure transducers and river discharge data (0.25 h resolution) were utilized to develop standardized indices of hydrologic connectivity for two oxbow lakes along the lower Guadalupe River, Texas over a 3.4 yr period. The lakes were influenced by hydrologic conditions representative of the northwestern Gulf region, notably a severe drought and a wet season associated with La Nina and El Nino, respectively. Because the data were obtained over the same period it enables a direct comparison of surficial hydrologic connectivity within the evolutionary geomorphic framework of the oxbow lake cycle.A recently (13 yr old) formed oxbow lake was connected 5.9 times per yr and an older partially infilled oxbow lake was connected 3.8 times per yr during the study period. Each oxbow lake was connected by discharge pulses below bankfull discharge, and the signature of hydrologic connectivity varied significantly. The flow duration for connectivity was 18% and 3% for the recently formed and older oxbow lake, respectively. Bivariate relations between discharge and lake stage varied significantly for the two oxbow lakes. The recently formed oxbow lake exhibited highly linear relations between discharge and lake levels, and lake drainage closely mirrored flood wave recession. Older oxbow lake connectivity was complex, as discharge and lake level relations were nonlinear and exhibited pronounced negative hysteresis, which increased with sequential flood pulses. While the older oxbow lake was more sensitive to short term low flow conditions, both lakes were completely desiccated during an extended La Nina influenced drought. This indicates a substantial impact to alluvial aquifers, which were unable to supply groundwater to oxbow lakes during extended dry periods. The ""flood pulse concept"" applied with only river discharge data is overly simplistic and does not adequately characterize hydrologic connectivity for distinct types of oxbow lakes along meandering river floodplains. With limited lake level data, however, great potential exists for development of effective ""integrated floodplain management"" plans that more appropriately considers variable hydrologic connectivity inherent within the oxbow lake cycle.

1,"Kessler, AJ",Mar 2015 ,The negligible effect of bed form migration on denitrification in hyporheic zones of permeable sediments,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Bed form celerity, the migration rate of ripples along a sediment bed, has previously been shown to have dramatic effects on oxygen distribution and transport within the hyporheic zone of permeable sediments. This has the potential to influence denitrification ratesin particular by increasing the coupling of nitrification and denitrification. To further understand this, we numerically modeled nitrogen cycling under migrating ripples. While the simulated oxygen profiles match with expected behavior, almost no effect on denitrification or coupled nitrification-denitrification was observed with increasing celerity. Instead, denitrification rates were dominantly controlled by the flow velocity of water overlying the sediment.Key PointsShow less"
2,"Carnie, R",Sep 2016 ,Habitat connectivity as a metric for aquatic microhabitat quality: application to Chinook salmon spawning habitat,ECOHYDROLOGY,"Quality of fish habitat at the scale of a single fish, at the metre resolution, which we defined here as microhabitat, has been primarily evaluated on short reaches, and their results have been extended through long river segments with methods that do not account for connectivity, a measure of the spatial distribution of habitat patches. However, recent investigations of quality of aquatic habitat at the stream segment scale, at hundredth of metre resolution macrohabitat, indicate that the spatial distribution of aquatic habitat quality and size is an important factor at the network scale. Here, we hypothesize that aquatic habitat connectivity, quality and patch size are also important at the microhabitat scale. We test this hypothesis by modelling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning habitat in a 6-km long reach of Bear Valley Creek (Idaho, USA) with microhabitat resolution of 1-m square. We use two-dimensional hydraulic numerical modelling coupled with suitability curves to predict the spatial distribution of spawning habitat quality. We quantify connectivity for each habitat patch with the ratio between the area of neighbouring patches and their squared hydrographic distances. Results from a logistic regression analysis comparing predicted with observed spawning locations indicate that habitat quality and patch size are important factors and connectivity among patches may have a secondary effect. Therefore, spatial distribution of aquatic habitat and size of habitat patches are important aspects of its quality, suggesting that composite metrics such as weighted usable area may not be sufficient in defining the condition of the river environment.

3,"Yin, XA",Oct 2018 ,A New Method of Assessing Environmental Flows in Channelized Urban Rivers,ENGINEERING,"Assessing environmental flows (e-flows) for urban rivers is important for water resources planning and river protection. Many e-flow assessment methods have been established based on species' habitat provision requirements and pollutant dilution requirements. To avoid flood risk, however, many urban rivers have been transformed into straight, trapezoidal-profiled concrete channels, leading to the disappearance of valuable species. With the construction of water pollution-control projects, pollutant inputs into rivers have been effectively controlled in some urban rivers. For these rivers, the e-flows determined by traditional methods will be very small, and will consequently lead to a low priority being given to river protection in future water resources allocation and management. To more effectively assess the e-flows of channelized urban rivers, we propose three e-flow degrees, according to longitudinal hydrological connectivity (high, medium, and low), in addition to the pollutant dilution water requirement determined by the mass-balance equation. In the high connectivity scenario, the intent is for the e-flows to maintain flow velocity, which can ensure the self-purification of rivers and reduce algal blooms; in the medium connectivity scenario, the intent is for the e-flows to permanently maintain the longitudinal hydrological connectivity of rivers that are isolated into several ponds by means of weirs, in order to ensure the exchange of material, energy, and information in rivers; and in the low connectivity scenario, the intent is for the e-flows to intermittently connect isolated ponds every few days (which is designed to further reduce e-flows). The proposed methods have been used in Shiwuli River, China, to demonstrate their effectiveness. The new methods can offer more precise and realistic e-flow results and can effectively direct the construction and management of e-flow supply projects. (C) 2018 THE AUTHORS.

4,"Constantz, J",Jul 1998 ,"Interaction between stream temperature, streamflow, and groundwater exchanges in Alpine streams",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Four alpine streams were monitored to continuously collect stream temperature and streamflow for periods ranging from a week to a year. In a small stream in the Colorado Rockies, diurnal variations in both stream temperature and streamflow were significantly greater in losing reaches than in gaining reaches, with minimum streamflow losses occurring early in the day and maximum losses occurring early in the evening. Using measured stream temperature changes, diurnal streambed infiltration rates were predicted to increase as much as 35% during the day (based on a heat and water transport groundwater model), while the measured increase in streamflow loss was 40%. For two large streams in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, annual stream temperature variations ranged from 0 degrees to 25 degrees C. In summer months, diurnal stream temperature variations were 30-40% of annual stream temperature variations, owing to reduced streamflows and increased atmospheric heating. Previous reports document that one Sierra stream site generally gains groundwater during low flows, while the second Sierra stream site may lose water during low flows. For August the diurnal streamflow variation was 11% at the gaining stream site and 30% at the losing stream site. On the basis of measured diurnal stream temperature variations, streambed infiltration rates were predicted to vary diurnally as much as 20% at the losing stream site. Analysis of results suggests that evapotranspiration losses determined diurnal streamflow variations in the gaining reaches, while in the losing reaches, evapotranspiration losses were compounded by diurnal variations in streambed infiltration. Diurnal variations in stream temperature were reduced in the gaining reaches as a result of discharging groundwater of relatively constant temperature. For the Sierra sites, comparison of results with those from a Small tributary demonstrated that stream temperature patterns were useful in delineating discharges of bank storage following dam releases. Direct coupling may have occurred between streamflow and stream temperature for losing stream reaches, such that reduced streamflows facilitated increased afternoon stream temperatures and increased afternoon stream temperatures induced increased streambed losses, leading to even greater increases in both stream temperature and streamflow losses.Show less"

7,"Guseva, S",Nov 2021 ,Variable Physical Drivers of Near-Surface Turbulence in a Regulated River,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Inland waters, such as lakes, reservoirs and rivers, are important sources of climate forcing trace gases. A key parameter that regulates the gas exchange between water and the atmosphere is the gas transfer velocity, which itself is controlled by near-surface turbulence in the water. While in lakes and reservoirs, near-surface turbulence is mainly driven by atmospheric forcing, in shallow rivers and streams it is generated by bottom friction of gravity-forced flow. Large rivers represent a transition between these two cases. Near-surface turbulence has rarely been measured in rivers and the drivers of turbulence have not been quantified. We analyzed continuous measurements of flow velocity and quantified turbulence as the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy over the ice-free season in a large regulated river in Northern Finland. Measured dissipation rates agreed with predictions from bulk parameters, including mean flow velocity, wind speed, surface heat flux, and with a one-dimensional numerical turbulence model. Values ranged from similar to 10-10m2s-3 to 10-5m2s-3. Atmospheric forcing or gravity was the dominant driver of near-surface turbulence for similar fraction of the time. Large variability in near-surface dissipation rate occurred at diel time scales, when the flow velocity was strongly affected by downstream dam operation. By combining scaling relations for boundary-layer turbulence at the river bed and at the air-water interface, we derived a simple model for estimating the relative contributions of wind speed and bottom friction of river flow as a function of depth.Show less"

However, these two-way interactions between land and river are currently missing in most Earth System Models. In this study, we introduced the two-way hydrological coupling between the land component, E3SM Land Model, and the river component, Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport, in Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to study the impacts of floodplain inundation on land and river processes. We calibrated the river channel geometry and developed a new data-driven inundation scheme to improve the simulation of inundation dynamics in E3SM. The new inundation scheme captures 96% of the spatial variation of inundation area in a satellite inundation product at global scale, in contrast with 7% when the default inundation scheme of E3SM was used. Global simulations including the new inundation scheme performed at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees resolution with and without land-river two-way coupling was used to quantify the impact of coupling. Comparisons show that two-way coupling modifies the water and energy cycle in 20% of the global land cells. Specifically, riverine inundation is reduced by two-way coupling, but inland inundation is intensified. Wetter periods are more impacted by the two-way coupling at the global scale, while regions with different climates exhibit different sensitivities. The two-way exchange of water between the land and river components of E3SM provides the foundation for enabling two-way coupling of land-river sediment and biogeochemical fluxes. These capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the interactions between water and biogeochemical cycles and their response to human perturbations.Show less"

We identify eight direct drivers (four natural and four anthropogenic) and at least four indirect drivers. Those drivers modify conditions in the fluvial network that promote fish movements, reproduction, and their larvae survivor. Landscape, rains, floods, connectivity of the fluvial net as land cover change, water pollution, hydropower, and alien species are the natural and anthropogenic direct drivers described in this article. The river-lake interaction dynamics in the Magdalena River are determined by two rainy cycles per year. Two seasonal flooding periods induce two cycles in the biological productivity of floodplains because water and sediment inputs. The most visible consequences in these hydrological cycles are the migrations of potamodromous fish and the periodic increase in the artisanal fishery production. Major floodplains are reducing their storage capacity by trapping & SIM;10%-40% of upstream sediment production. This process induces many research questions about rates of biomass production, carbon fluxes in the basin, impacts of human-induced erosion, and increasing rates of sediment load on floodplain connectivity, but still there is not enough data to answer them. Finally, we make some suggestions toward the sustainability of the Magdalena floodplains. The well-being of the floodplain ecosystems and their connectivity with the main river are the main tools to preserve and manage the ecosystem services of the Magdalena River and its floodplains lakes.Show less"
12,"Segatto, PL",Jul 2020 ,Modeling the coupled dynamics of stream metabolism and microbial biomass,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Estimating and interpreting ecosystem metabolism remains an important challenge in stream ecology. Here, we propose a novel approach to model, estimate, and predict multiseasonal patterns of stream metabolism (gross primary production [GPP] and ecosystem respiration [ER]) at the reach scale leveraging on increasingly available long-term, high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO). The model uses DO measurements to estimate the parameters of a simple ecosystem model describing the underlying dynamics of stream autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial biomass. The model has been applied to four reaches within the Ybbs river network, Austria. Even if microbial biomasses are not observed, that is, they are treated as latent variables, results show that by accounting for the temporal dynamics of biomass, the model reproduces variability in metabolic fluxes that is not explained by fluctuations of light, temperature, and resources. The model is particularly data-demanding: to estimate the 11 parameters used in this formulation, it requires sufficiently long, for example, annual, time series, and significant scouring events. On the other hand, the approach has the potential to separate ER into its autotrophic and heterotrophic components, estimate a richer set of ecosystem carbon fluxes (i.e., carbon uptake, loss, and scouring), extrapolate metabolism estimates for periods when DO measurements are unavailable, and predict how ecosystem metabolism would respond to variations of the driving forces. The model is seen as a building block to develop tools to fully appreciate multiseasonal patterns of metabolic activity in river networks and to provide reliable estimations of carbon fluxes from land to ocean.Show less"
13,"Schaper, JL",Sep 1 2018 ,The fate of polar trace organic compounds in the hyporheic zone,WATER RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is often considered to efficiently remove polar trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from lotic systems, mitigating potential adverse effects of TrOCs on ecosystem functioning and drinking water production. Predicting the fate of TrOCs in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is difficult as the in-situ removal rate constants are not known and the biogeochemical factors as well as hydrological conditions controlling the removal efficiency are not fully understood. To determine the in-situ removal efficiency of the HZ for a variety of TrOCs as a function of the biogeochemical milieu, we conducted a field study in an urban river near Berlin, Germany. Subsurface flow was studied by time series of temperature depth profiles and the biogeochemical milieu of the HZ by concentration depth profiles. These results, in conjunction with a 1D advection-dispersion transport model, were used to calculate first-order removal rate constants of several polar TrOCs in the HZ. For the majority of TrOCs investigated, removal rate constants were strongly dependent on redox conditions, with significantly higher removal rates observed under predominantly suboxic (i.e. denitrifying) compared to anoxic (i.e. Fe and Mn reducing) conditions. Compared to previous studies on the fate of TrOCs in saturated sediments, half-lives within oxic/suboxic sections of the HZ were relatively low, attributable to the site-specific characteristics of the HZ in a stream dominated by wastewater treatment plant effluent. For nine out of thirteen investigated TrOCs, concentrations decreased significantly in the HZ with relative removal percentages ranging from 32% for primidone to 77% for gabapentin. For many TrOCs, removal efficiency decreased drastically as redox conditions became anoxic. For the majority of compounds investigated here, the HZ indeed acts as an efficient bioreactor that is capable of removing TrOCs along relatively short flow paths. Depending on the TrOC, removal capacity may be enhanced by either increasing the magnitude of groundwater-surface exchange fluxes, by increasing the total residence time in the HZ or the exposure time to suboxic zones, respectively.

14,"Bian, ZQ",Sep 2021 ,"Analysis of Forest Landscape Restoration Based on Landscape Connectivity: A Case Study in the Yi River Basin, China, during 2015-2020",LAND,"Landscape connectivity has widely been recognized as one of the key objectives in studies of forest landscape management, ecological conservation and construction. Protecting virgin forests and afforesting marginal cropland are two long-term ecological projects in China. However, along with rapid urbanization and industrialization in China, the relationship between landscape connectivity and forest landscape restoration (FLR) has not been fully explored. The emergent question concerns whether the connectivity of a restored forest landscape could benefit the local flora and fauna. We evaluated the status of FLR in the Yi River watershed based on remote sensing images during 2015-2020. The forest landscape connectivity (FLC) was investigated using landscape connectivity indicators, applying the theory of landscape connectivity. We also examined the variations of FLC under different landform types (hills and low mountains) according to distance threshold values ranging from 100 m to 20,000 m. The most appropriate distance thresholds for analyzing FLC in hills and low mountains are 500 m and 100 m, respectively. The results showed that in this period, the FLC in low mountains was increased, whereas that of hills was decreased. The contributions for reforested patches on the improvement of the FLC were evaluated. In hills, patches that made ""very high"" and ""high"" contributions to improve the FLC occupied 15.6% of the total reforested area, whereas the proportion in low mountains was 25.5%. The results indicated that although rainfed cropland patches have been converted to forest patches, some of them have made small contributions to the FLC. Through this case study, we hope to have confirmed that landscape connectivity analysis could be used as a criterion for selecting important patches in the planning of FLR. Moreover, we have introduced this implementable method for future ecological restoration management programs.Show less"

During warm periods, groundwater-surface water interactions have two primary effects on stream temperature: (1) cool groundwater discharging as baseflow lowers stream temperature and (2) hyporheic exchange buffers diurnal stream temperature variations. We demonstrate, for the first time, how high-resolution, remotely sensed forward-looking infrared (FLIR) images and instream temperature data can be used to quantify detailed spatial patterns of groundwater discharge to a 1.7 km reach of Cottonwood Creek in Plumas National Forest, CA. We quantify the individual effects of baseflow and hyporheic exchange on stream temperatures by simulating the stream energy budget under different conceptual models of the stream-aquifer interaction. Observed spatial and temporal patterns of stream temperature are consistent with an increase in baseflow and hyporheic exchange within the middle, restored stream reach when compared to groundwater fluxes in the surrounding, unrestored reaches. One implication is that pond and plug stream restoration may improve the aquatic habitat by depressing maximum stream temperatures by > 3 C ( K).Show less"
17,"Waters, JM",Jan 2016 ,Fine-scale habitat preferences influence within-river population connectivity: a case-study using two sympatric New Zealand Galaxias fish species,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Understanding the ecological factors governing population connectivity in freshwater systems represents an ongoing challenge for aquatic biologists.2. We used genetic analysis to test the hypothesis that fine-scale habitat preferences can influence within-river connectivity patterns in freshwater-limited fishes.3. Genetic variation among sampling sites within systems was compared for co-distributed fish taxa Galaxias gollumoides (low-velocity pool/swamp habitat) versus an undescribed species, Galaxias 'southern' (high-velocity riffle habitat), using phi statistics. These analyses incorporated 1624 bp of mtDNA from 429 galaxiid specimens, encompassing 95 localities across four river systems in Southland, New Zealand.4. Although similar numbers of haplotypes per river were detected in both taxa, spatial partitioning of this genetic variation within rivers was significantly stronger for G. gollumoides (mean phi(ST) = 0.539) than for G. 'southern' (mean phi(ST) = 0.142). Within-catchment genetic divergence values were also higher for the former species.5. These finding suggest that a combination of main-channel habitat continuity and high water velocity facilitates relatively high connectivity in G. 'southern', whereas G. gollumoides populations are genetically isolated in fragmented low-velocity habitats. We conclude that population connectivity can be strongly influenced by habitat preference, leading to profound differences in the phylogeography, diversity and conservation status of freshwater fish lineages.Show less"

19,"Mcdowell, RW",Aug 2020 ,Likely controls on dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations in baseflow of an agricultural stream,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"Purpose High baseflow phosphorus (P) concentrations increase the likelihood of periphyton blooms. Several physical and chemical factors can control baseflow P concentrations such as hydraulic exchange with groundwater, particle size-sorting, redox chemistry and different sediment sources. We hypothesized that of these sources, anoxic sediments would allow P-rich groundwater to influence baseflow P concentrations the most and that the measurement of the equilibrium P concentration (EPC0) of sediments under oxic conditions would not predict P release in anaerobic sediment or baseflow P concentrations. Materials and methods At four locations along an agricultural stream, we measured dissolved reactive P (DRP), pH, iron, manganese, sulphate, nitrate and dissolved oxygen in streamflow and hyporheic water at 0-200, 200-400 and 400-800 mm depths and P fractions and EPC0 in sediment samples from the 0-200, 200-400 and 400-800 mm depths. Results and discussion Concentrations of DRP in streamflow and shallow hyporheic zone water increased downstream and were mirrored by concentrations in shallow sediment, EPC0 measurements of oxic sediments and deeper hyporheic waters. Groundwater samples and the EPC0 in deeper sediments did not show a pattern or residence time consistent with the supply of P to baseflow despite deeper sediment being anoxic and less likely to sorb upwelling P. There was also no change in pH or particle size downstream ruling out the degassing of groundwater or sediment size-sorting as an influence. However, the composition of sediment and underlying lithology of the catchment pointed to sediment downstream that was different to upstream sediment in that it could store and release more P. Conclusions Given the strong influence of sediment source on baseflow P concentrations, efforts to decrease the likelihood of periphyton blooms under baseflow should focus on reducing the erosion of P-rich sediment. Furthermore, the presence of oxic conditions in surface sediment meant that there was a relationship between EPC0 and hyporheic water P concentrations. However, mixed oxic/anoxic conditions in deeper layer may require EPC0, or release rates, to be measured under reducing conditions.Show less"
20,"Diamond, JS",,Light and hydrologic connectivity drive dissolved oxygen synchrony in stream networks,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Stream dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics are an outcome of metabolic activity and subsequently regulate ecosystem functions such as in-stream solute and sediment reactions. The synchronization of DO signals in and across stream networks is both a cause and effect of the mode and timing of these functions, but there is limited empirical evidence for network patterns of DO synchrony. We used high frequency DO measurements at 42 sites spanning five catchments and stream orders to evaluate DO signal synchrony in response to variation in light (a driver of photosynthesis) and discharge (a control on DO signal spatial extent). We hypothesized that stream network DO synchrony arises when regional controls dominate: when light inputs are synchronous and when longitudinal hydrologic connectivity is high. By complement, we predicted that DO signal synchrony decreases as light becomes more asynchronous and stream flows decline or become discontinuous. Our results supported this hypothesis: greater DO signal synchrony arose with increasing light synchrony and flow connectivity. A model including these two controls explained 70% of variation in DO synchrony. We conclude that DO synchrony patterns within- and across-networks support the current paradigm of discharge and light control on stream metabolic activity. Finally, we propose that DO synchrony patterns are likely a useful prerequisite for scaling subdaily metabolism estimates to network and regional scales.Show less"
21,"Powers, SM",Apr 2012 ,Nutrient Retention and the Problem of Hydrologic Disconnection in Streams and Wetlands,ECOSYSTEMS,"Some aquatic systems have disproportionately high nutrient processing rates, and may be important to nutrient retention within river networks. However, the contribution of such biogeochemical hot spots also depends on water residence time and hydrologic connections within the system. We examined the balance of these factors in a comparative study of nitrate (NO3-) uptake across stream and flow-through wetland reaches of northern Wisconsin, USA. The experimental design compared NO3- uptake at different levels: the ecosystem level, for reaches (n = 9) consisting of morphologically contrasting subreaches (SLOW, low mean water velocity; REF, reference, or higher mean water velocity); the sub-ecosystem level, for subreaches consisting of morphologically contrasting zones (TS, transient storage zone; MC, main channel zone). SLOW subreaches had 45% lower ecosystem-level uptake rate (K, t(-1)) on average, indicating reduced uptake efficiency in flow-through wetlands relative to streams. The four largest K values (total n = 24) also occurred in REF subreaches. TS:MC uptake rate varied (range 0.1-6.0), but MC zones consistently accounted for most NO3- uptake by the ecosystem. In turn, TS influence was limited by a tradeoff between TS zone uptake rate and the strength of TS-MC hydrologic connection (alpha or F-med). Additional modeling of published hydrologic parameter sets showed that strong MC dominance of uptake (> 75% of total uptake), at the scale of solute release methods (meters to kilometers, hours to days), is common among streams and rivers. Our results emphasize that aquatic nutrient retention is the outcome of a balance involving nutrient uptake efficiency, water residence time, and the strength of hydrologic connections between nutrient sources and sinks. This balance restricts the influence of hydrologically disconnected biota on nutrient transport, and could apply to diverse ecosystem types and sizes.Show less"

We show that spatial variability in hyporheic flow in the East River near Crested Butte, CO, drives heterogeneity in streambed geochemical conditions and microbial community assemblages, but the diversity of microbial assemblages remains nearly constant throughout the reach. In July 2018, we collected approximately 100 pore water samples at 20-cm depth and analyzed them for anions, cations, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, and basic water quality parameters. Vertical hydraulic head gradients were also measured to assess the potential for upward or downward flow, and heat tracing was used to quantify vertical flux rates at a subset of locations. We found that regions of the streambed that are more groundwater-dominated contain less dissolved oxygen, higher concentrations of reduced metals, and more microbially processed, recalcitrant DOM, while more surface water-dominated locations contain higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and terrestrially derived, labile DOM. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of extracted DNA revealed that microbial community composition varies with geochemical gradients related to hyporheic flow. These findings provide a better understanding of hyporheic controls on streambed biogeochemistry during the baseflow season, which is expected to lengthen with climate change in alpine watersheds due to earlier snowmelt onset and reduced snowpack.Plain Language Summary Groundwater and surface water mixing in streambeds (hyporheic exchange) is important for nutrient and carbon cycling and influences the overall quality of surface water. In this study, we aimed to map relationships between hyporheic exchange, pore water chemistry, and microbial communities in the streambed of an alpine river during low flow conditions. We found that regions of the streambed with greater surface water influence had larger concentrations of dissolved oxygen and microbially available carbon compounds. The composition of streambed microbial communities also shifted with changes in pore water chemistry, though communities were all similarly diverse. As climate change progresses, earlier snowmelt onset and reduced snowpack should alter flow and biogeochemical processes in streambeds. This study provides a baseline for exploring future changes in alpine streambeds.Show less"
23,"Gilbert, JT",Jun 2021 ,An Ecogeomorphic Framework Coupling Sediment Modeling With Invasive Riparian Vegetation Dynamics,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE,"Feedbacks between geomorphic processes and riparian vegetation in river systems are an important control on fluvial morphodynamics and on vegetation composition and distribution. Invasion by nonnative riparian species alters these feedbacks and drives management and restoration along many rivers, highlighting a need for ecogeomorphic models to assist with understanding feedbacks between plants and fluvial processes, and with restoration planning. In this study, we coupled a network-scale sediment model (Sediment Routing and Floodplain Exchange; SeRFE) that simulates bank erosion and sediment transport in a spatially explicit manner with a recruitment potential analysis for a species of riparian vegetation (Arundo donax) that has invaded river systems and wetlands in Mediterranean climates worldwide. We used the resulting ecogeomorphic framework to understand both network-scale sediment balances and the spread and recruitment of A. donax in the Santa Clara River watershed of Southern California. In the coupled model, we simulated a 1-year time period during which a 5-year recurrence interval flood occurred in the mainstem Santa Clara River. Outputs identify key areas acting as sources of A. donax rhizomes, which are subsequently transported by flood flows and deposited in reaches downstream. These results were validated in three study reaches, where we assessed postflood geomorphic and vegetation changes. The analysis demonstrates how a coupled model approach is able to highlight basin-scale ecogeomorphic dynamics in a manner that is useful for restoration planning and prioritization and can be adapted to analogous ecogeomorphic questions in other watersheds.Show less"

In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, many glacial meltwater streams flow for only 5-12 weeks a year and yet support extensive benthic microbial communities. We investigated NO3- uptake and denitrification in Green Creek by analyzing small-scale microbial mat dynamics in mesocosms and reach-scale nutrient cycling in two whole-stream NO3- enrichment experiments. Nitrate uptake results indicated that microbial mats were nitrogen (N)-limited, with NO3- uptake rates as high as 16 nmol N cm(-2) h(-1). Denitrification potentials associated with microbial mats were also as high as 16 nmol N cm(-2) h(-1). During two whole-stream NO3--enrichment experiments, a simultaneous pulse of NO2- was observed in the stream water. The one-dimensional solute transport model with inflow and storage was modified to simulate two storage zones: one to account for short time scale hydrologic exchange of stream water into and out of the benthic microbial mat, the other to account for longer time scale hydrologic exchange with the hyporheic zone. Simulations indicate that injected NO3- was removed both in the microbial mat and in the hyporheic zone and that as much as 20% of the NO3- that entered the microbial mat and hyporheic zone was transformed to NO2- by dissimilatory reduction. Because of the rapid hydrologic exchange in microbial mats, it is likely that denitrification is limited either by biotic assimilation, reductase limitation, or transport limitation (reduced NO2- is transported away from reducing microbes).Show less"
26,"Stegmann, LF",Oct 17 2019 ,Distance to large rivers affects fish diversity patterns in highly dynamic streams of Central Amazonia,PLOS ONE,"Longitudinal-zonation hypotheses generally predict gradual changes in fish composition from upstream to downstream due to changes in habitat conditions, but largely disregard downstream effects on upstream segments. Floodplains of large rivers represent areas of high connectivity during flood periods and can act as stable refuges in dry seasons, which may attenuate deterministic constraints imposed by local conditions on fish assemblages in surrounding habitats. In this study, we investigated the effects of proximity to large rivers on taxonomic- and functional-diversity patterns of stream-fish assemblages in an extensive region of Central Amazonia. We sampled 31 headwater-stream reaches in nine catchments in the Purus and Madeira Rivers interfluve between December 2014 and March 2015. Ninety seven fish species from seven orders and 19 families were captured. The results indicate that distance to large rivers is more important than distance among sites and local conditions in explaining functional and taxonomic diversity of stream-fish assemblages at large spatial scales. We also found a decrease in taxonomic and functional richness towards headwaters, mainly related to the loss of benthic and sedentary species along the distance gradient. These species may be favored by the proximity to refuge areas and high resource availability near the floodplain. In contrast, upstream assemblages were mainly occupied by small-sized, nektonic species with higher dispersal capacity, highly dependent of allochthonous resources. Downstream effects could be detected for many kilometers upstream in hydrographic catchments and this reinforces the crucial role of connectivity between fluvial habitats in maintenance of stream-fish diversity patterns in the region.Show less"
27,"Incze, L",2010 ,Connectivity of lobster (Homarus americanus) populations in the coastal Gulf of Maine: part II. Coupled biophysical dynamics,FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY,"We used a coupled biophysical model to investigate larval transport and connectivity patterns in the Gulf of Maine lobster (Homarus americanus) population. Biological 'particles' were released at over 21 000 locations every 10 days over a 4-month hatching period, and were followed from hatching through late postlarval stage. In addition to circulation and dispersion, model calculations included spatial patterns of egg production, temporal patterns of hatching, temperature-dependent development, vertical distribution and mortality. We ran the model for three larval production seasons using the same hatching patterns and individual-based modeling parameters but different flow patterns in the coastal current system. Model results gave distribution and abundance patterns of competent postlarvae that closely resembled observed, alongshore patterns of lobster settlement density. We evaluated the relative contribution of all source regions to the total number of competent postlarvae in a series of medium-size zones along the coastal shelf, many of which are used in lobster management. Connectivity depended on many factors, including patterns of egg production and transport, and the location and size of the receiving zones. Self recruitment ranged from a few percent to > 90% of competent postlarvae. Although it was common for postlarvae to come from many, often distant, sources, most of the competent postlarvae in a zone originated within one to two zones in the prevailing 'up-stream' direction, forming shorter connections along the coast than the energetic currents might otherwise suggest. Inshore migrations during summer hatching may contribute to these shorter patterns of connectivity. Transport in the prevailing 'upstream' direction was also indicated.Show less"
28,"Akbari-Moghanjoughi, M",Mar 2017 ,Mode Coupling and Two-Stream Instabilities in Semiconductors,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE,"The quantum hydrodynamic model is used to investigate the arbitrary degenerate electron/hole stream instabilities in ballistic semiconductors or semiconductor plasmas (semiplasmas) for a wide range of impurity doping, number density, and temperatures. It is observed that, while the instability in classical plasma regime is always of single k-range type, the double-range instability can occur in degenerate plasma regime. Different types of carrier counter-streaming instabilities are classified and parametrically studied in arbitrarily doped ballistic semiconductors. The parametric study of counter-stream instability in silicon at room temperature shows that the doping scheme has fundamental effect on electron-electron and hole-hole instabilities but no effect on electron-hole instability. Other parameters, such as the electron temperature and stream speed, have significant effects on the unstable wavenumber range and the growth rate. It is remarked that the electron stream in n-type semiconductors becomes unstable at somewhat lower limit of the stream speed than that of holes in a p-type silicon semiconductors. A description based on the energy exchange between unstable modes is given for different instability types. It is found that the instability in asymmetric doped semiconductors (electron-electron and hole-hole) is of symmetric type without energy exchange between the modes, while, for symmetric doped semiconductors (electron-hole), it is of asymmetric type with the energy exchange. Finally, it is found that the electron and hole spin exchange-correlation effects enhance the two-stream instability.Show less"
29,"Leigh, C",Mar 2009 ,Hydrological connectivity drives patterns of macroinvertebrate biodiversity in floodplain rivers of the Australian wet dry tropics,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Floodplain rivers in Australia's wet/dry tropics are regarded as being among the most ecologically intact and bio-diverse lotic ecosystems in the world, yet there have been relatively few community-based studies of their aquatic fauna.2. To investigate relationships between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity in the region, macroinvertebrates were collected from sites within two contrasting floodplain rivers, the 'tropical' Gregory River and 'dryland' Flinders River systems, during the dry season and analysed at various spatial scales. A subset of sites was re-sampled in the following dry season to explore temporal variation. The fauna consisted of 124 morphotaxa, dominated by gatherers and the Insecta.3. As predicted, hydrological connectivity (the lotic or lentic status of waterbodies) had a major influence on macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and diversity, both in space and time. Assemblages from waterbodies with similar connection histories were most alike, and beta-diversity between assemblages was greatest between lotic and lentic waterbodies, tending to increase with increasing spatial separation.4. At smaller spatial scales, a number of within-waterbody, habitat and water quality characteristics were important for explaining variation (61%) in the taxonomic organization of assemblages, and characteristics associated with primary productivity and habitat diversity were important for explaining variation (45%) in the functional organization of assemblages. However, much of the small-scale environmental variation across the study region appeared to be related to broad-scale variation in hydrological connectivity, which had both direct and indirect effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages.5. Conservation of the biodiversity in Australia's wet/dry tropics may depend on conserving the natural variation in hydrological connectivity and the unregulated flow of floodplain rivers.Show less"
30,"Zheng, LZ",Apr 2016 ,Temperature effects on nitrogen cycling and nitrate removal-production efficiency in bed form-induced hyporheic zones,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Hyporheic flow in aquatic sediment controls solute and heat transport thereby mediating the fate of nutrients and contaminants, dissolved oxygen, and temperature in the hyporheic zone ( HZ). We conducted a series of numerical simulations of hyporheic processes within a dune with different uniform temperatures, coupling turbulent open channel fluid flow, porous fluid flow, and reactive solute transport to study the temperature dependence of nitrogen source/sink functionality and its efficiency. Two cases were considered: a polluted stream and a pristine stream. Sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the influence of stream water [NO3-]/[NH4+]. The simulations showed that in both cases warmer temperatures resulted in shallower denitrification zones and oxic-anoxic zone boundaries, but the trend of net denitrification rate and nitrate removal or production efficiency of the HZ for these two cases differed. For both cases, at high [NO3-]/[NH4+], the HZ functioned as a NO3- sink with the nitrate removal efficiency increasing with temperature. But at low [NO3-]/[NH4+] for the polluted stream, the HZ is a NO3- sink at low temperature but then switches to a NO3- source at warmer temperatures. For the pristine stream case, the HZ was always a NO3- source, with the NO3- production efficiency increasing monotonically with temperature. In addition, although the interfacial fluid flux expectedly increased with increasing temperature due to decreasing fluid viscosity, the total nitrate flux into the HZ did not follow this trend. This is because when HZ nitrification is high, uniformly elevated [NO3-] lowers dispersive fluxes into the HZ. We found that there are numerous confounding and interacting factors that combined to lead to the final temperature dependence of N transformation reaction rates. Although the temperature effect on the rate constant can be considered as the dominant factor, simply using the Arrhenius equation to predict the reaction rate would lead to incomplete insight by ignoring the changes in interfacial fluid and solute fluxes and reaction zone areas. Our study shows that HZ temperature and stream [NO3-]/[NH4+] are key controls for HZ sink/source functions.Show less"
31,"Jimenez-Fernandez, O",Feb 2022 ,Groundwater-surface water exchange as key control for instream and groundwater nitrate concentrations along a first-order agricultural stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Lower-order streams (first- and second-order) define the initial, landscape-related, chemical signature of stream water in catchments. To date, first-order streams have been perceived as predominantly draining systems, which collect water and solutes from the surrounding groundwater and surface runoff and simply mirror the chemical composition of the inputs. In this study, the impact of stream-groundwater exchange fluxes on water chemistry of a first order agricultural stream (Schonbrunnen) and its connected groundwater in south-western Germany was assessed combining Rn-222, dissolved ions (chloride, sulphate, nitrate), and salt tracer tests with investigations of stream discharge and groundwater hydraulic gradients. The findings suggest that stream-water chemistry in lower-order streams is governed by an intricate interplay between dynamic, bidirectional water and solute exchange between groundwater and the stream leading to a pronounced hydrologic turnover along the studied reaches. High nitrate concentrations (up to 79 mg/L as NO3-) in stream water were attenuated in downstream direction (a mean value of 39 mg/L) without an increase in discharge, suggesting that redox processes occurring during sediment passage in sequential infiltration and exfiltration zones affect stream water chemistry. Nitrate in stream water infiltrating into the aquifer at distinct losing spots was subject to denitrification within the first few decimetres of the streambed, while concurrent exfiltration of low-nitrate groundwater into the stream at gaining spots compensated for flow losses and in turn diluted instream nitrate concentrations. In summary the findings imply that (1) instream mixing resulting from the bidirectional exchange of water between groundwater and the stream (hydrologic turnover) affects instream nitrate concentrations, (2) denitrification in the streambed of losing reaches and the near-stream aquifer significantly contributes to reactive nitrate turnover and elimination, and (3) oxidation of ammonium could be a secondary source of nitrate inputs into the stream.Show less"
32,"Godfrey, AE",Dec 1 2008 ,"Episodic sediment delivery and landscape connectivity in the Mancos Shale badlands and Fremont River system, Utah, USA",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"The Fremont River drains about 1000 km(2) of Mancos Shale badlands, which provide a large percentage of the total sediment load of its middle and lower reaches. Factors controlling sediment movement include: weathering that produces thin paralithic soils, mass movement events that move the soil onto locations susceptible to fluvial transport, intense precipitation events that move the sediment along rills and across local pediments, and finally Fremont River floods that move the sediment to the main-stem Colorado River. A forty-year erosion-pin study has shown that down-slope creep moves the weathered shale crust an average of 5.9 cm/yr. Weather records and our monitoring show that wet winters add large slab failures and mudflows. Recent sediment-trap studies show that about 95% of sediment movement across pediments is accomplished by high-intensity summer convective storms. Between 1890 and 1910, a series of large autumn floods swept down the Fremont River, eroding its floodplain and transforming it from a narrow and meandering channel to a broad, braided one. Beginning about 1940, the Fremont's channel began to narrow. Sequential aerial photos and cross-sections suggest that floodplain construction since about 1966 has stored about 4000 to 8000 m(3) of sediment per kilometer per year. These data suggest that it will take two centuries to restore the floodplain to its pre-1890 condition, which is in line with geologic studies elsewhere on the Colorado Plateau.The various landscape elements of slope, pediment. and floodplain are semi-independent actors in sediment delivery, each with its own style. Accelerated mass movement on the slopes has an approximate 20-year recurrence. Sediment movement from slope across pediments to master stream is episodic and recurs more frequently. The slope-to-pediment portion of the system appears well connected. However, sediment transport through the floodplain is not well connected in the decadal time scale, but increases in the century and millennial time scales, and changes over time depending on the cycle of arroyo cutting and filling.

Results showed the increasing area and the widening Wuhan forest. However, for the past 20 years, their patch structure has been uneven, and composed of several small and super-large patches. The IIC and PC of Wuhan forest tended to increase slightly, whereas the connectivity level of urban forest remained low. The value of the importance of the patch and its range are increasing. Some of its characteristics indicated north is better than south, rural is higher than urban, and the main urban area is lesser than the urban area.Show less"
34,"Radigan, WJ",Mar 2018 ,Otolith chemistry as a fisheries management tool after flooding: The case of Missouri River gizzard shad,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Reduced river-floodplain connectivity can decrease fisheries production and cause ecological and socioeconomic consequences. In 2011, the largest flood on record in the Missouri River since 1898 nearly eliminated connectivity between an embayment (Hipple Lake) and Lake Sharpe, impeding movement of walleye (Sander vitreus) and a forage fish, gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum). Thus, we used otolith chemistry to quantify Hipple Lake's natal contribution to Lake Sharpe's gizzard shad population and forecast effects of connectivity loss on the reservoir's socioeconomically important walleye fishery. Fish were classified to natal habitats with 79-89% accuracy, with most gizzard shad (64%) hatching in floodplain habitats (i.e., embayments, tributaries, canals, and stilling basins). Hipple Lake contributed 12% of gizzard shad to Lake Sharpe, more than a tributary (4%) and embayment (0%) but less than a canal (27%) and stilling basin (21%). Hipple Lake (178acres) covers 0.31% of Lake Sharpe (56,884acres), so its natal contribution is 38 times what would be expected if contribution was linearly related to area. Sediment and water management to maintain connectivity between Lake Sharpe and Hipple Lake and other floodplain habitats is important for continued gizzard shad production and prey supply for the walleye fishery. Otolith chemistry facilitates assessment of gizzard shad natal contributions in different habitats, serving as a fisheries management tool to inform floodplain habitat protection and rehabilitation after floods.Show less"
35,"Lai, XJ",Jun 7 2013 ,Large-scale hydrodynamic modeling of the middle Yangtze River Basin with complex river-lake interactions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The flow regime in the middle Yangtze River Basin is experiencing rapid changes due to intensive human activities and ongoing climate change. The middle reach of Yangtze River and the associated water system are extremely difficult to be reliably modeled due to highly complex interactions between the main stream and many tributaries and lakes. This paper presents a new Coupled Hydrodynamic Analysis Model (CHAM) designed for simulating the large-scale water system in the middle Yangtze River Basin, featured with complex river-lake interactions. CHAM dynamically couples a one-dimensional (1-D) unsteady flow model and a two-dimensional (2-D) hydrodynamic model using a new coupling algorithm that is particularly suitable for large-scale water systems. Numerical simulations are carried out to reproduce the flow regime in the region in 1998 when a severe flood event occurred and in 2006 when it experienced an extremely dry year. The model is able to reproduce satisfactorily the major physical processes featured with seasonal wetting and drying controlled by strong river-lake interactions. This indicates that the present model provides a promising tool for predicting complex flow regimes with remarkable seasonal changes and strong river-lake interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of all the available data made it possible to define the characteristic periods in the autumn-winter low-water season. The waters of the seasonally thawed layer play the dominant role in the river's recharge in September; the suprapermafrost water, in January; and the subgelisol water (nonfreezing water streams) during the 30-day-long period of the minimal flow. The quantitative parameters of the groundwater runoff corresponding to its module during this period reflect the water influx to the active water-exchange zone. It is established that the latter is minimal in the In'yali-Debin synclinorium, which consists of sedimentary rocks formed in deepwater trough environments. Their subsequent transformation proceeded under the action of subduction-accretionary and shear strains. The water avail-ability in the active water-exchange in the Ayan-Yuryakh anticlinorium zone is substantially higher, although the Late Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic sedimentary formations of this area were also deposited in deepwater trough settings, but their subsequent evolution was related to the uplift of the anticlinorium. The maximal watering is observed in the active water-exchange zone of the Omulevka terrane, which is composed of Paleozoic terrigenous-carbonate and carbonate formations. The differences in the hydrogeological regimes of the terranes may be significant with respect to their geoecology.Show less"
37,"Frick, C",Oct 1 2020 ,Elucidating fecal pollution patterns in alluvial water resources by linking standard fecal indicator bacteria to river connectivity and genetic microbial source tracking,WATER RESEARCH,"A novel concept for fecal pollution analysis was applied at alluvial water resources to substantially extend the information provided by fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). FIB data were linked to river connectivity and genetic microbial source tracking (MST). The concept was demonstrated at the Danube River and its associated backwater area downstream of the city of Vienna, using a comprehensive 3-year data set (10 selected sites, n = 317 samples). Enumeration of Escherichia coli (ISO 16649-2), intestinal enterococci (ISO 7899-2) and Clostridium perfringens (ISO 14189) revealed a patchy distribution for the investigation area. Based on these parameters alone a clear interpretation of the observed fecal contamination patterns was not possible. Comparison of FIB concentrations to river connectivity allowed defining sites with dominating versus rare fecal pollution influence from the River Danube. A strong connectivity gradient at the selected backwater sites became obvious by 2D hydrodynamic surface water modeling, ranging from 278 days (25%) down to 5 days (<1%) of hydraulic connectivity to the River Danube within the 3-year study period. Human sewage pollution could be identified as the dominating fecal source at the highly connected sites by adding information from MST analysis. In contrast, animal fecal pollution proofed to be dominating in areas with low river connectivity. The selection of genetic MST markers was focusing on potentially important pollution sources in the backwater area, using human (BacHum, HF183II), ruminant (BacR) and pig (Pig2Bac)-associated quantitative PCR assays. The presented approach is assumed to be useful to characterize alluvial water resources for water safety management throughout the globe, by allocating fecal pollution to autochthonous, allochthonous, human or animal contamination components.Show less"

Unlike riffles, research has focused rarely on the hyporheic zone of pools. To highlight the functioning of a pool, field investigations were performed in a riffle-pool-riffle sequence by integrating simultaneously physico-chemistry, microbes and invertebrates. The study was conducted in a channel characterised by strong downwelling of surface water.2. To include the downstream flux of water within the sediment, a longitudinal profile was studied along six stations situated: at the centre (Station 1) and at the lower end (Station 2) of the first riffle, at the upstream part (Station 3), at the centre (Station 4, at the inflection point) and at the lower end (Station 5) of the pool, and at the centre of the second riffle (Station 6). At each station, three replicate samples were taken and three sample depths were investigated (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 m below the stream bed) on two dates.3. Physico-chemical parameters (vertical hydraulic gradient, oxygen concentration and specific conductance) differed between stations depending on infiltration rates. In contrast, organic matter and microbial parameters presented patchy distributions linked with factors other than the geomorphological pattern. Despite not very pronounced geomorphologic features, the slope variation at the centre of the pool (at the inflection point) affects the distribution of epigean and hypogean invertebrates.4. Based upon faunal parameters, the pool could be divided into an upstream and a downstream part, the latter being more strongly influenced by surface water.5. The pool should be considered as a heterogeneous area. In that respect, the inflection point of a pool may be as important as the top of a riffle in the functioning of river sediments.Show less"

In the present study, the connectivity of river water and shallow groundwater along the Shidi River, China is estimated using a connectivity index, as well as analyses of hydrochemistry and isotopic signature. The three approaches for hydraulic connectivity assessment were compared and discussed. An end member mixing analysis was performed to estimate the contribution ratios of local precipitation, river leakage and groundwater lateral inflow to the total groundwater recharge along the river. The results show that medium connectivity is identified in all reaches of the river (upstream, midstream and downstream). Water table depth and river channel sediments are the major factors responsible for the spatial variation of the hydraulic connectivity. The CI approach can be adopted to generate preliminary assessment results of hydraulic connectivity, while the physiochemical and isotopic approaches should be used as a tool for results validation and verification. Groundwater lateral inflow is the most important recharge source of groundwater along the river, while river leakage only accounts for 18.4-27.0 % of the total recharge. This study is meaningful in integrated water resources management in arid regions and the methods used in this study can be adopted by other scholars in similar studies.Show less"

An important but as of yet unaddressed issue is the development of new modeling approaches which are applicable to resident fish species habitat restoration programs. In this paper, we develop a budget constrained optimization model for deciding which barriers to repair or remove in order to maximize habitat availability for stream resident fish. Habitat availability at the local stream reach is determined based on the recently proposed C metric, which accounts for the amount, quality, distance and level of connectivity to different stream habitat types. We assess the computational performance of our model using geospatial barrier and stream data collected from the Pine-Popple Watershed, located in northeast Wisconsin (USA). The optimization model is found to be an efficient and practical decision support tool. Optimal solutions, which are useful in informing basin-wide restoration planning efforts, can be generated on average in only a few minutes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"

Hydrologic variation plays a major role in structuring the biotic diversity within river ecosystems as it controls key habitat conditions within the river channel, the floodplain, and hyporheic (stream-influenced ground water) zones. Alterations in streamflow regimes may modify many of these habitat attributes and impair ecosystem connectivity. We demonstrate use of the 'Range of Variability Approach' for assessing hydrologic alteration at available streamgauge sites throughout a river basin. We then illustrate a technique for spatially mapping the degree of hydrologic alteration for river reaches at and between streamgauge sites. Such maps can be used to assess the Loss of natural hydrologic variation at a river basin scale, thereby facilitating river restoration planning. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
42,"Han, BS",Nov 2015 ,Streambed and water profile response to in-channel restoration structures in a laboratory meandering stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In-channel structures are often installed in alluvial rivers during restoration to steer currents, but they also modify the streambed morphology and water surface profile, and alter hydraulic gradients driving ecologically important hyporheic exchange. Although river features before and after restoration need to be compared, few studies have collected detailed observations to facilitate this comparison. We created a laboratory mobile-bed alluvial meandering river and collected detailed measurements in the highly sinuous meander before and after installation of in-channel structures, which included one cross vane and six J-hooks situated along 1 bar unit. Measurements of streambed and water surface elevation with sub-millimeter vertical accuracy and horizontal resolution were obtained using close-range photogrammetry. Compared to the smooth gradually varied water surface profile for control runs without structures, the structures created rapidly varied flow with subcritical to supercritical flow transitions, as well as backwater and forced-morphology pools, which increased volumetric storage by 74% in the entire stream reach. The J-hooks, located along the outer bank of the meander bend and downstream of the cross vane, created stepwise patterns in the streambed and water surface longitudinal profiles. The pooling of water behind the cross vane increased the hydraulic gradient across the meander neck by 1% and increased local ground-water gradients by 4%, with smaller increases across other transects through the intrameander zone. Scour pools developed downstream of the cross vane and around the J-hooks situated near the meander apex. In-channel structures significantly changed meander bend hydraulic gradients, and the detailed streambed and water surface 3-D maps provide valuable data for computational modeling of changes to hyporheic exchange.Show less"

Tested on two field cases, the coupled model is stable even in the case of generalized overflow over the riverbanks or of levee breaching. For lateral coupling, the coupled model allows saving computational time compared to a full 2-D model and to provide valuable results concerning the flooding features as well as the evolution of the bed topography. However, despite a similar simplified representation of the sediment features in the 1-D and 2-D models, some discrepancies appear in the case of upstream/downstream coupling along a cross section perpendicular to the flow direction because the assumption of homogeneous velocity and concentration is not valid for estimating sediment transport. Further research is necessary to be able to define a suitable distribution of the sediments on the 1-D side of the boundary between the two models.Show less"
44,"Cheng, DW",Dec 2021 ,The evolutional states of seasonally losing unclogged stream-groundwater systems,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Losing streams are widespread in arid and semi-arid regions. Exploring the evolutional states of losing stream-groundwater systems is of great significance to understand the exchanges of water, mass and energy in stream-aquifer systems. This study is devoted to investigate the evolutional process of infiltration flux, pressure head and flow states of a seasonally losing stream-groundwater system with the semi-permeable streambeds missing (or without clogging). The paper constructs a new theoretical framework for the evolutional states of the system. In particular, it focuses on investigating the transition among different evolutional states including disconnected state, transitional state, negative-pressure connected state and positive-pressure connected state, and the critical conditions of transition between connected and disconnected states. The critical conditions associated with disconnection or connection are that 1) the zero-flux zone starts to disappear, 2) the unsaturated zone starts to disappear, and 3) the negative pressure zone starts to disappear. Analytical solutions of those critical conditions are proposed. The evolutional process of stream leakage is characterized into two stages: the first stage corresponds to the disconnected and transitional states in which the seepage fluxes decrease with time; the second stage corresponds to the fully connected state in which the seepage flux decreases rapidly again as time developing. Finally, the influence of various controlling parameters on the critical conditions is analyzed. The critical time (t(CRI1)) and critical depth (z(CRI1)) of changing from the disconnected state to the transitional state have nonlinear correlations with saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), pore-size distribution index (A) and flux at the base of the unconfined aquifer (q). The critical time (t(CRI2)) and the critical depth (z(CRI2)) of changing from the transitional state to the negative-pressure connected state and the critical time (t(CRI3)) of changing from the negative-pressure connected state to the positive-pressure connected state all have nonlinear correlations with K-s and lambda.z(CRI1) and Z(CRI2) are independent of saturated water content (theta(s)) and residual water content WO. An innovative physical interpretation is given to system evolutional states and quantifiable criteria for those evolutional states are proposed. The findings of this study can help better understand the evolutional states of seasonally losing stream-groundwater systems, and it lays a foundation for further research on water exchange, mass transport and ecological protection in stream-groundwater systems.Show less"

In order to investigate the polluted characteristics, a coupled modelling approach has been deployed and the study area in the Pear River Delta is divided into two modelling systems: a river network that is simulated by a 1D hydrodynamic and water quality model, and an estuary that is modelled by a 3D model. The 1D river network model is coupled with the 3D estuary model based on the mass conservation criteria. The hydrodynamic (HD) model is based on 1D hydrostatic shallow water equations, and is solved by the Alternating Direction Implicit Approach. The water quality (WQ) model component is based on advection-diffusion equations. Some physical and bio-chemical processes are included in the WQ model to address the water pollution problems by different pollution substances, in particular, to the chemical oxygen demand (COD). The water quality data of the main rivers from 2004 to 2007 were collected, processed and evaluated. Because no detailed water quality data in the river is available, the COD source pollution intensity in the water quality model is taking the pollutant load from the confluence of the main five outlets of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) for 1996-2007 as surrogate. The results show that the pollutants from the PRDR have a large impact on the quality of the Hong Kong seawater and much more serious in the wet season with high river discharge. An insight of the flow and transportation mechanism in the river and estuary system has been obtained through the paper, and a reliable basis to control water pollution of the Pearl River Delta is provided in this paper.

We calculated hydrologic signatures for each drying event and using multivariate statistics, grouped events into drying regimes characterized by: (a) fast drying, (b) long no-flow duration, (c) prolonged drying following low antecedent flows, (d) drying without a distinctive hydrologic signature. 77% of gages had more than one drying regime at different times within the study period. Random forests revealed land cover/use are more important to how a river dries than climate or physiographic characteristics. Clustering stream drying behavior may allow practitioners to more systematically adapt water resource management practices to specific drying regimes or rivers.Show less"
48,"Whitney, MM",Oct 11 2021 ,Freshwater Composition and Connectivity of the Connecticut River Plume During Ambient Flood Tides,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"The Connecticut River plume interacts with the strong tidal currents of the ambient receiving waters in eastern Long Island Sound. The plume formed during ambient flood tides is studied as an example of tidal river plumes entering into energetic ambient tidal environments in estuaries or continental shelves. Conservative passive freshwater tracers within a high-resolution nested hydrodynamic model are applied to determine how source waters from different parts of the tidal cycle contribute to plume composition and interact with bounding plume fronts. The connection to source waters can be cut off only under low-discharge conditions, when tides reverse surface flow through the mouth after max ambient flood. Upstream plume extent is limited because ambient tidal currents arrest the opposing plume propagation, as the tidal internal Froude number exceeds one. The downstream extent of the tidal plume always is within 20 km from the mouth, which is less than twice the ambient tidal excursion. Freshwaters in the river during the preceding ambient ebb are the oldest found in the new flood plume. Connectivity with source waters and plume fronts exhibits a strong upstream-to-downstream asymmetry. The arrested upstream front has high connectivity, as all freshwaters exiting the mouth immediately interact with this boundary. The downstream plume front has the lowest overall connectivity, as interaction is limited to the oldest waters since younger interior waters do not overtake this front. The offshore front and inshore boundary exhibit a downstream progression from younger to older waters and decreasing overall connectivity with source waters. Plume-averaged freshwater tracer concentrations and variances both exhibit an initial growth period followed by a longer decay period for the remainder of the tidal period. The plume-averaged tracer variance is increased by mouth inputs, decreased by entrainment, and destroyed by internal mixing. Peak entrainment velocities for younger waters are higher than values for older waters, indicating stronger entrainment closer to the mouth. Entrainment and mixing time scales (1-4 h at max ambient flood) are both shorter than half a tidal period, indicating entrainment and mixing are vigorous enough to rapidly diminish tracer variance within the plume.Show less"
49,"Wang, WK",May 15 2014 ,Estimating streambed parameters for a disconnected river,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Evaluation of stream-aquifer interaction and water balance for a catchment often requires specific information on streambed parameters, such as streambed hydraulic conductivity, seepage flux across the streambed and so on. This paper describes a simple, inexpensive instrument that is used to measure these streambed parameters under the condition of a stream disconnected from groundwater. Our method includes a seepage cylinder for simulation of river water depth. The proposed method was applied to estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity of a streambed and the changes in vertical seepage rate from stream to groundwater with varied stream water depth in the Manasi River of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The vertical hydraulic conductivities of the streambed determined from 12 sites along the Manasi River vary from 1.01 to 29.m/day where the stream disconnects from the groundwater. The experimental results suggest that there are two kinds of relations between the vertical seepage rate and the simulated stream water depth. One is a linear relation between the two variables with low Reynolds numbers (less than 10); the other is a nonlinear relation (exponential relation) between the two variables with larger Reynolds numbers (greater than 10). This second relationship is quite different from the traditional model that usually calculates the vertical seepage rate from stream to groundwater under the condition of disconnection using a linear relation (Darcy's Law). Our results suggest that a linear relation can only be used for a limited range of river water depth. This method gives a convenient tool for rapidly estimating the streambed hydraulic conductivity and the changes in the vertical seepage rate across streambed with varied stream water depths for the case of a stream disconnected from groundwater.
