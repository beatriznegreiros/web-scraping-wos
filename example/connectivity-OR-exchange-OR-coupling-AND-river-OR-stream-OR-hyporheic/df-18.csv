0,"Davy-Bowker, J",Jun 2006 ,The distribution of benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrates from the heads and tails of riffles,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The spatial distribution of benthic (up to 0.05 m depth) and hyporheic (0.25 and 0.5 m depth) macroinvertebrates from downwelling zones at the heads of riffles and upwelling zones at the tails of riffles was examined in two studies on a 4th order chalk stream in Dorset, England. In the first study, differences in benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate community composition between the head and tail of a single riffle were investigated. In the second study, a replicated design involving eight riffles was used to compare benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate community composition both between heads and tails of the same riffles and between riffles. In the first (usingle riffle) study there were significantly higher mean numbers of benthic invertebrates and families at the riffle head (715 individuals and 13.8 families per 0.0225 m 2) compared to the tail (192 individuals and 8.7 families). ANOSIM analysis also showed that the community structure of head and tail benthic samples was significantly different. In the second (replicated riffle) study, there were also significantly more benthic invertebrates at riffle heads ((x) over bar = 594 per 0.0225 m 2) compared to tails ((x) over bar = 417 per 0.0225 m 2), although this was not the case for families, and community structure also differed significantly between riffle heads and tails. In contrast, in the hyporheic zone, there were no significant differences between the total numbers of invertebrates in the riffle heads and tails, or between riffles, although a significant difference in family richness between riffle head and tail samples was identified in the first study. Community analysis revealed progressively poorer separation of riffle head and tail samples at 0.25 m and 0.5 m hyporheic depths. Whilst being able to identify clear differences in benthic communities from riffles heads and tails, the physically heterogeneous nature of the riffle habitats studied made it difficult to account for the consistent differences in macroinvertebrate communities observed with the physical variables measured.Show less"

2,"Ward, AS",Jan-feb 2013 ,How Does Subsurface Characterization Affect Simulations of Hyporheic Exchange?,GROUND WATER,"We investigated the role of increasingly well-constrained geologic structures in the subsurface (i.e., subsurface architecture) in predicting streambed flux and hyporheic residence time distribution (RTD) for a headwater stream. Five subsurface realizations with increasingly resolved lithological boundaries were simulated in which model geometries were based on increasing information about flow and transport using soil and geologic maps, surface observations, probing to depth to refusal, seismic refraction, electrical resistivity (ER) imaging of subsurface architecture, and time-lapse ER imaging during a solute tracer study. Particle tracking was used to generate RTDs for each model run. We demonstrate how improved characterization of complex lithological boundaries and calibration of porosity and hydraulic conductivity affect model prediction of hyporheic flow and transport. Models using hydraulic conductivity calibrated using transient ER data yield estimates of streambed flux that are three orders of magnitude larger than uncalibrated models using estimated values for hydraulic conductivity based on values published for nearby hillslopes (10-4 vs. 10-7 m2/s, respectively). Median residence times for uncalibrated and calibrated models are 103 and 100 h, respectively. Increasingly well-resolved subsurface architectures yield wider hyporheic RTDs, indicative of more complex hyporheic flowpath networks and potentially important to biogeochemical cycling. The use of ER imaging to monitor solute tracers informs subsurface structure not apparent from other techniques, and helps to define transport properties of the subsurface (i.e., hydraulic conductivity). Results of this study demonstrate the value of geophysical measurements to more realistically simulate flow and transport along hyporheic flowpaths.Show less"
3,"Huber, E",Sep 2013 ,Spatiotemporal scales of river-groundwater interaction: a multidimensional hydrogeological investigation approach,GRUNDWASSER,"River-groundwater interactions show strong scale-dependencies and are often strongly transient. In this regard, small-scale flow conditions in the hyporheic zone at the interface between surface- and groundwater can be important for process-understanding. This especially includes questions concerning flow conditions in salmonid redds of gravel-bed rivers. The Swiss subalpine river Enziwigger was chosen as an example for a small channelized river with artificial steps within the riverbed. Several methods were developed, tested and combined that capture the four dimensions (three spatial and one temporal) of the interactions between surface water, the hyporheic zone and groundwater, for individual river segments. The setup of a monitoring network as well as the realization of field-measurements provided data for groundwater flow models. Continuous time series of hydraulic data, temperature and electrical conductivity within the river and the riverbed, as well as within the riverine groundwater, allowed identifying zones with significant exchange of surface water and groundwater. Additionally, the data helped describe the transient character of groundwater flow-paths under various hydrological boundary conditions. Results of the field-measurements in combination with transient groundwater flow modeling and scenario analyses illustrate the relevance of dynamically changing infiltration and exfiltration patterns within the riverbed.Show less"
4,"Jung, HS",Feb 2011 ,Modeling of Nitrogen Retention in Amite River,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"This paper presents an efficient and effective modeling approach to estimation of nitrogen retention in streams and rivers. The approach involves an extension of a newly developed longitudinal solute transport model, variable residence time (VART), by incorporating a first-order nitrogen reaction term. Parameters involved in the VART model are estimated using monthly mean flow and water quality data obtained through both field measurements and watershed modeling using the Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran model. It is found that there is a strong correlation between nitrate-nitrogen removal rate and water temperature. In addition, low nitrate-nitrogen concentrations commonly occur when total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are also low, and high nitrogen concentrations correspond to high DO and TOC, indicating that denitrification is the primary biogeochemical process controlling nitrogen removal in natural rivers. The new approach is demonstrated through the computation of nitrogen removal in the Amite River, LA, USA. Functional relationships between the nitrate-nitrogen removal rate and water temperature are established for the Amite River. Monthly mean nitrate-nitrogen concentrations along the river are computed using the extended VART model, and computed nitrogen concentrations fit observed ones very well. The estimated annual nitrate-nitrogen removal in the Amite River is 27.4 tons or 15.5% of total nitrate-nitrogen transported annually through the Amite River.Show less"
5,"Stubbington, R",2012 ,"The hyporheic zone as an invertebrate refuge: a review of variability in space, time, taxa and behaviour",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone is a potential refuge that can promote persistence of benthic invertebrates during adverse conditions in surface streams. For decades, changes in invertebrate depth distribution have been investigated in relation to flood, low flow and drying events, but evidence for use of the hyporheic refuge remains equivocal. This review examines the evidence for the hyporheic zone's refugial role during adverse hydrological conditions. Refuge potential is influenced by determinants in four categories. First, refuge use varies spatially in relation to physical habitat parameters, including sediment porosity and hydrologic exchange. Second, refuge use is temporally variable and reflects disturbance characteristics including rate of onset. Third, refuge use is taxon-specific, depending on a range of morphological, behavioural and physiological traits. Fourth, the behaviours governing refuge use vary, with both active migrations and passive habitat use playing important roles in community persistence. These four determinants interact to influence refuge use; for example, the physical habitat providing an adequate refuge will vary between taxa. Despite this variability, the hyporheic zone is an important component in the suite of refuges that facilitate community resilience to disturbance events. As such, its ecological integrity should be safeguarded through sensitive management and effective rehabilitation schemes.Show less"
6,"Zhou, SB",Dec 2014 ,Groundwater-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone under climate change scenarios,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Slight changes in climate, such as the rise of temperature or alterations of precipitation and evaporation, will dramatically influence nearly all freshwater and climate-related hydrological behavior on a global scale. The hyporheic zone (HZ), where groundwater (GW) and surface waters (SW) interact, is characterized by permeable sediments, low flow velocities, and gradients of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics along the exchange flows. Hyporheic metabolism, that is biogeochemical reactions within the HZ as well as various processes that exchange substances and energy with adjoining systems, is correlated with hyporheic organisms, habitats, and the organic matter (OM) supplied from GW and SW, which will inevitably be influenced by climate-related variations. The characteristics of the HZ in acting as a transition zone and in filtering and purifying exchanged water will be lost, resulting in a weakening of the self-purification capacity of natural water bodies. Thus, as human disturbances intensify in the future, GW and SW pollution will become a greater challenge for mankind than ever before. Biogeochemical processes in the HZ may favor the release of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) under climate change scenarios. Future water resource management should consider the integrity of aquatic systems as a whole, including the HZ, rather than independently focusing on SW and GW.Show less"
7,"Cardenas, MB",Jan 7 2009 ,A model for lateral hyporheic flow based on valley slope and channel sinuosity,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The meandering of rivers results in head gradients across point bar deposits leading to hyporheic exchange: the flow of groundwater from and back to the stream. Two models for predicting horizontal fluid flux through the hyporheic zone, one based solely on valley slope and another that uses both valley slope and channel sinuosity, are presented in this article. Both models require knowledge of aquifer hydraulic conductivity. The models are developed via a suite of groundwater flow simulations with boundary conditions taking a variety of channel geometries, idealized as sinusoidal, and valley slopes that we assume are similar to that of the water table. Functional predictive models are developed by fitting a line or surface to discrete model output which covers the spectrum of most natural meandering rivers. Since the fitted models only require channel slope and/or sinuosity (plus hydraulic conductivity), they are amenable for regional estimation of hyporheic flux using digital terrain data.Show less"
8,"Liu, RP",Oct 2022 ,Potential Toxic Impacts of Hg Migration in the Disjointed Hyporheic Zone in the Gold Mining Area Experiencing River Water Level Changes,WATER,"In order to study the occurrence form, vertical migration and transformation and the potential ecological risk of Hg in the disjointed hyporheic zone in the gold mining area is investigated. Through field investigation, in-situ test, and test analysis, the results show that: (1) the form of mercury in the original stratum where the river water-groundwater hydraulic connection is disconnected is mainly in the residual state, accounting for 77.78% of the total mercury; (2) after the water content increases or the water level changes, the various forms of occurrence in the soil surface layer decrease, and the residual state is still the main form; the main forms of mercury in the sand and pebble layer are diversified, including the residual state, strong organic state and humic acid state; (3) the mercury content in the subsurface zone in winter is higher than that in summer; (4) although the mercury content in groundwater has not been detected, the potential ecological risk of mercury in the disjointed Hyporheic zone near the river in the study area is much higher than the extreme ecological hazard threshold, which has a value of 320. The risk of groundwater pollution caused by mercury during the long-term runoff of the river is higher than that during the flood period. Therefore, relevant departments need to rectify the river as soon as possible, from the source to reduce the ecological risk of heavy metals to groundwater. The results will provide a scientific basis for groundwater control.Show less"
9,"Liu, Y",Dec 2022 ,Toward An Assessment of Runoff and Thermal Connectivity in A River-Lake System within An Urban Environment,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS,"The term 'hydrological connectivity' is used in different disciplines to refer to the water-mediated transfer of matter, energy, and/or organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Extensive research has been devoted to methods of evaluating hydrological connectivity. However, most of these methods pertain to the connectivity of runoff, sediment, chemicals, and organisms. To our knowledge, no evaluation of thermal energy connectivity has been conducted to date, and there is no consistent assessment framework available that takes into account thermal energy connectivity based on flux. Thermal energy flux affects many basic biogeochemical reaction processes and ecological functions of healthy river-lake systems. Here, we propose a method to evaluate runoff and thermal connectivity based on a modified version of the index of runoff/sediment connectivity proposed by Borselli et al. (2008). It was tested in an urban area (Tongling, China, which covers an area of 3008 km(2)) - characterized by the presence of numerous rivers and lakes - during normal, wet, and dry periods from year 2016 to year 2018. We found that areas with poor runoff connectivity exhibited high thermal connectivity in dry periods. Connectivity variation in lakes was higher than that in rivers. Models of the measured data were satisfactory for the test periods. Overall, our results indicate that public data can be used to map runoff and thermal connectivity within an existing joint evaluation framework. Evaluations of thermal connectivity can assist research on hydrological connectivity, and the proposed method can serve as a valuable tool for analyzing the runoff and thermal connectivity of urban river-lake systems.Show less"
10,"Lehotsky, M",Apr 2018 ,Multitemporal assessment of coarse sediment connectivity along a braided-wandering river,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,"The article presents the postflood period coarse sediment connectivity (CSC) assessment approach on the basis of the holistic ideas of the interpretation of the long-term CSC in river channels. Seven sets of remote sensing data (1949-2009) were used as the basic information sources to study the CSC along the braided-wandering Bela River by using the patch-graph approach for assessing the structural connectivity. The bar areas (patches), with 200m direct links between them, and the attribute of a deflection angle of a link to the flow direction were parameters used to estimate the integral index of connectivity (IIC) and bar area and bar link importance indices. The higher values of the IIC fit with a well-developed bar system. Conversely, the values of the IIC decrease because of the progressive degradation of the braided pattern. The potential functional CSC was inferred from the variability of the values obtained by the balance indices representing the balance of the channel-floodplain connectivity (B1) and the bar-bar connectivity (B2). Eight types of the potential functional CSC based on the balance indices and the deduction of processes that conditioned the channel-floodplain and in-channel CSC linkages were identified. In order to assess the development of the braidplain pattern in terms of the structural connectivity during the study time span, the linear trendline analysis of IIC associated with flood periods was applied. On the basis of the coefficient of determination, all reaches exhibit a decreasing trend in IIC values but different response to flood periods.Show less"
11,"Kibichii, S",2015 ,The influence of water quality on hyporheic invertebrate communities in agricultural catchments,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"Despite knowing that agricultural practices affect river ecosystems, studies on water quality and associated hyporheic invertebrate communities are rare. Yet such knowledge is essential for sustainable use of agricultural and water resources. This study, carried out in the agricultural region of south-eastern Ireland in Spring 2007, examined the effect of water pollution on hyporheic fauna. Six river sites of known water quality were assigned to two treatments, namely, clean and polluted rivers. Two hyporheic habitats, below the wetted channel (hyporheic substream) and below the exposed gravel bank (parafluvial), were sampled within each treatment. Total invertebrate densities and richness, crustacean densities and richness, and densities of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) were significantly reduced in polluted hyporheic and parafluvial habitats. A higher recorded concentration of nitrate in the polluted hyporheic substream habitats was a significant factor in determining the invertebrate assemblages, with reductions in total and crustacean densities, and EPT richness. Similarly, invertebrate density and richness were reduced in polluted parafluvial habitats, likely being related to agricultural intensity, management practices and reduced riparian buffering. This study highlights the direct effects of agricultural practices on the invertebrate communities of hyporheic habitats and emphasises the need for holistic management and conservation measures to ensure future protection.Show less"
12,"Janzen, K",Win 2011 ,Hyporheic Flows Along a Channelled Peatland: Influence of Beaver Dams,CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL,"Investigation into the effects of beaver darns on hyporheic fluxes in channelled peatlands is needed to better understand how biological processes drive stream-riparian area connections and thus nutrient export, and to improve our overall conceptual model of water storage and flow through peatlands. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of beaver dams on vertical and lateral hyporheic exchange. Hydrometric methods were used to determine subsurface flow pathways and estimate hyporheic water fluxes for a third-order stream draining a Canadian Rocky Mountain peatland in 2006 and 2007. Three sites were studied two contained small, in-channel beaver darns and the third was a control. Vertical hyporheic fluxes equaled or exceeded lateral hyporheic fluxes despite the fact that hydraulic conductivity of the stream bed tended to be lower than the banks, suggesting peat hydraulic properties were not the dominant factor in the development of hyporheic exchange in stream systems draining peatlands as has been reported for streams underlain by mineral substrates. Instead, vertical fluxes were partially influenced by the presence of a mineral lens similar to 0.65 in below the ground surface. As well, high riparian water tables in relation to stream stage were key to limiting lateral fluxes. Steep hydraulic gradients above the two darns created looping flow pathways beneath and around them. However, little water actually flowed along these pathways. Measures of larger fluxes of water to the riparian area above the dams than those returning to the stream below the darns suggests either that hyporheic flow paths are longer than those measured in other studies or that the beaver dams generated recharge to the groundwater flow system.Show less"
13,"Sawyer, AH",Aug 7 2009 ,Hyporheic flow and residence time distributions in heterogeneous cross-bedded sediment,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The permeability heterogeneity of cross-bedded sediment increases path lengths of river-groundwater mixing (hyporheic exchange) in riverbeds and modifies the distribution of residence times. For two case studies, we numerically simulated fluid flow and solute transport through immobile bed forms composed of heterogeneous sediment and equivalent homogeneous sediment in order to clarify how cross-bedded permeability structures impact hyporheic exchange. The two permeability fields are from the cross-bedded Massillon Sandstone and modern climbing ripple deposits of the Brazos River (Texas). In both cases, permeability heterogeneity creates long hyporheic exchange paths but only slightly increases the depth of exchange relative to equivalent homogeneous sediment. In the Massillon example, permeability heterogeneity increases the proportion of long hyporheic residence times (>3 days). In the Brazos example, permeability heterogeneity increases the proportion of short residence times (<17 h). We attribute the different responses in residence time distributions to differences in permeability patterns near the sediment-water interface. The tails of residence time distributions extend for tens of years and conform to a power law in both heterogeneous and homogeneous sediment. Current-bed form interactions are responsible for the long tails, as opposed to permeability heterogeneity.Show less"
14,"Ader, E",Mar 15 2021 ,Logjams as a driver of transient storage in a mountain stream,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"We use four stream segments along a wood-rich, pool-riffle mountain stream in the Southern Rockies of Colorado, USA to examine how spatial variations in wood load and variations in discharge during and after the snowmelt peak flow influence the magnitude of surface and subsurface transient storage. Segments range in complexity from a single channel with no large wood to an anabranching channel with closely spaced, channel-spanning logjams. Discharges at which transient storage was assessed range from base flow to snowmelt peak flow. To explore these relations, we used 10 geomorphic variables representing channel morphology and bed substrate, four wood-related variables representing wood load and associated backwater storage, and two measures of skewness from instream and bulk electrical conductivity breakthrough curves during tracer tests. Instream curves reflect surface and subsurface transient storage, whereas bulk curves primarily represent subsurface transient storage. Higher values of skewness indicate greater retention, and we used the values here as a metric of increased transient storage. Although limited sample size restricts the power of our results, our findings suggest that stream segments with greater instream large wood loads have more and larger pools, greater storage of fine sediment and particulate organic matter, and higher values of skew from instream conductivity. The results also suggest that the presence of instream wood, rather than changes in channel morphology associated with wood, is the most important driver of transient storage. This implies that river management designed to foster transient storage should focus on retaining instream large wood. We did not find significant correlations between geomorphic or wood-related variables and the skew estimated from bulk conductivity, which may reflect the relatively thin alluvium present in the field area and the prevalence of surface transient storage in this system.Show less"
15,"Shelley, F",Dec 2017 ,Enhanced hyporheic exchange flow around woody debris does not increase nitrate reduction in a sandy streambed,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Anthropogenic nitrogen pollution is a critical problem in freshwaters. Although riverbeds are known to attenuate nitrate, it is not known if large woody debris (LWD) can increase this ecosystem service through enhanced hyporheic exchange and streambed residence time. Over a year, we monitored the surface water and pore water chemistry at 200 points along a similar to 50 m reach of a lowland sandy stream with three natural LWD structures. We directly injected N-15-nitrate at 108 locations within the top 1.5 m of the streambed to quantify in situ denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, which, on average, contributed 85, 10 and 5% of total nitrate reduction, respectively. Total nitrate reducing activity ranged from 0 to 16 A mu M h(-1) and was highest in the top 30 cm of the stream bed. Depth, ambient nitrate and water residence time explained 44% of the observed variation in nitrate reduction; fastest rates were associated with slow flow and shallow depths. In autumn, when the river was in spate, nitrate reduction (in situ and laboratory measures) was enhanced around the LWD compared with non-woody areas, but this was not seen in the spring and summer. Overall, there was no significant effect of LWD on nitrate reduction rates in surrounding streambed sediments, but higher pore water nitrate concentrations and shorter residence times, close to LWD, indicated enhanced delivery of surface water into the streambed under high flow. When hyporheic exchange is too strong, overall nitrate reduction is inhibited due to short flow-paths and associated high oxygen concentrations.Show less"
16,"Wang, LF",Dec 2022 ,"Effect of water chemistry on nitrogen transformation, dissolved organic matter composition and microbial community structure in hyporheic zone sediment columns",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,"Controlled surface water systems, including those with dams lead to dynamic stage changes that alter the fluctuation directions of flow exchange in the hyporheic zones (HZ). However, the nitrogen transformation, dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, and microbial community responding to variable scenarios of water source and hyporheic exchange are poorly studied. The present work investigated nitrogen transformation in HZ sediments, focusing on how microbial community structure and biological functions related to nitrogen transformation and sediment-attached DOM compositions. Upwelling of synthesized groundwater, downwelling of synthesized river water and exchangeable elution of both feed water created distinct microbial zonation and N-transformation processes. Mixing of river water and groundwater enhanced microbial diversity, microbial co-occurrence network complexity and N-transformation functions. In terms of the sediment-attached DOM prop-erties after hyporheic exchanges, humic fractions occupied the predominant chromophoric DOM. Correlation analysis implied that there were more DOM properties, e.g., tryptophan-like proteins, humic-like fractions, and the source of humic fractions, involved in affecting the microbial community under downwelling flow. Co-occurrence network analysis verified that fluorescent components, protein-like and lignin-like fractions in sediment-detached DOM were clustered with microbial communities in one module in downwelling column, implying closer interactions among microbial communities and DOM fractions. The strains of Nitrospinae, Dinghuibacter, and Lentimicrobium etc. were key species collaborating to metabolize both nitrogen and DOM in HZ sediments. The work provides insights into how the nitrogen transformation, DOM compositional changes, as well as the linkages between community structure and DOM factions, response to the changes in water chemistry, leading to valuable insights into hyporheic zone functions.Show less"
17,"Bardini, L",May 1 2012 ,Nutrient cycling in bedform induced hyporheic zones,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,"The hyporheic zone is an ecotone connecting the stream and groundwater ecosystem that plays a significant role for stream biogeochemistry. Water exchange across the stream-sediment interface and biogeochemical reactions in the streambed concur to affect subsurface solute concentrations and eventually nutrient cycling in the fluvial corridor. In this paper we investigate the interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes in a duned streambed and their effect on spatial distribution of solutes. We employ a numerical model to simulate the turbulent water flow and the pressure distribution over the dunes, and then to evaluate the flow field and the biogeochemical reactions in the hyporheic sediments. Sensitivity analyses are performed to analyze the influence of hydrological and chemical properties of the system on solute reaction rates. The results demonstrate the effect of stream velocity and sediment permeability on the chemical zonation. Changing sediment permeability as well as stream velocity directly affects the nutrient supply and the residence times in the streambed, thus controlling the reaction rates under the dune. Stream-water quality is also shown to influence the reactive behavior of the sediments. In particular, the availability of dissolved organic carbon determines whether the streambed acts as a net sink or source of nitrate. This study represents a step towards a better understanding of the complex interactions between hydrodynamical and biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

18,"Brosten, TR",Jul 15 2009 ,Estimating 3D variation in active-layer thickness beneath arctic streams using ground-penetrating radar,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"We acquired three-dimensional (3D) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data across three stream sites on the North Slope, AK, in August 2005, to investigate the dependence of thaw depth on channel morphology. Data were migrated with mean velocities derived from multi-offset GPR profiles collected across a stream section within each of the 31) survey areas. GPR data interpretations from the alluvial-lined stream site illustrate greater thaw depths beneath riffle and gravel bar features relative to neighboring pool features. The peat-lined stream sites indicate the opposite; greater thaw depths beneath pools and shallower thaw beneath the connecting runs. Results provide detailed 3D geometry of active-layer thaw depths that can support hydrological studies seeking to quantify transport and biogeochemical processes that occur within the hyporheic zone.

19,"Liu, SN",Jun 2018 ,Impacts of different rainfall patterns on hyporheic zone under transient conditions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays an important role in stream ecology. Previous studies have mainly focused on the factors influencing the HZ in the steady state. However, the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the HZ can become transient during a storm. This study investigates the impacts of different rainfall patterns (varying in intensity and duration) on the HZ under transient conditions. A two-dimensional numerical model of a 10-m long and 2-m deep domain is developed, in which the streambed consists of a series of dunes. Brinkman-Darcy and Navier-Stokes equations are respectively solved for groundwater and surface water, and velocity and pressure are coupled at the interface (i.e., the streambed surface). To compare the results under different transient conditions, this study proposes two indicators, i.e., the influential time (IT, the time required for the HZ to return to its initial state once it starts to change) and the influential depth (ID, the maximum increment in the HZ depth). To detect the extent to which the HZ undergoes significant spatial changes, moving split-window and inflection point tests are conducted. The results indicate that rainfall intensity (RI) and rainfall duration (RD) both display logarithmic relationships with the IT and ID with high coefficients of determination, but only between certain lower and upper thresholds of the RI and RD. Moreover, the distributions of the IT and ID as a function of the RI and RD are mapped using the surface spline and kriging interpolation methods to facilitate future prediction of the IT and ID. In addition, it is observed that the IT has a linear negative correlation with the groundwater response while the ID is not affected by different groundwater responses. All of the derived relationships can be used to predict the impacts of a future rainfall event on the HZ.Show less"
20,"Claret, C",Oct 2003 ,Diel variation in surface and subsurface microbial activity along a gradient of drying in an Australian sand-bed stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Microbes play key roles in nutrient transformation and organic matter mineralisation in the hyporheic zone but their short-term responses to diel variations in discharge and temperature are unknown. Rates of microbial esterase activity were hypothesised to vary vertically and along a gradient of moisture in a drying sand-bed stream where discharge fluctuated daily in response to evapotranspiration.2. At 'fully saturated', 'moist' and 'dry' locations in three sites along a drying Australian sand-bed stream, microbial activity at three depths ( surface, 10 and 30 cm) was assessed using fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. Samples were collected in mid-summer in the late afternoon and again at dawn to assess diel variation in hydrolytic activity at each site and depth. Data loggers tracked diel variations in temperature at each depth.3. Hydrolytic activity was up to 10-fold greater in the surface sediments in late afternoon than at dawn in all habitats, and was correlated with surface sediment temperature. Diel differences in activity were not detected at 10 cm, although daily thermal cycles were evident at this depth. Unexpectedly, activity was marginally higher at dawn at 30 cm in all habitats, perhaps reflecting lags in temperature at that depth.4. Overall, microbial activity declined with depth, strongly correlated with vertical trends in total organic matter and concentrations of dissolved phosphorus. Particulate organic matter, probably buried during a flood 35 days earlier, appeared largely responsible for these vertical trends. On the other hand, there was little evidence for hydrological exchange between much of the hyporheic zone and the surface stream, implying that processes in the subsurface zone of this stream are effectively isolated during baseflow in mid-summer.5. Diel cycles of wetting and drying in the moist habitats did not enhance esterase activity relative to the dry or fully saturated habitats. Sediment moisture was not correlated with microbial activity, and mats of senescent algae appeared to inhibit water loss from surface sediments in the moist habitat. In this sand-bed stream, local diel fluctuations in water level appear to have less influence on microbial activity and mineralisation of organic matter in the sediments than occasional floods that bury leaf litter and renew many hyporheic zone functions. Subreach-scale processes seem to be the major driving force of microbial processes and nutrient cycling in this sand-bed river.Show less"
21,"Paillex, A",Feb 2009 ,Large river floodplain restoration: predicting species richness and trait responses to the restoration of hydrological connectivity,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Floodplains are species-rich environments often strongly impacted by human activities. In particular, the negative effects of progressive and rapid disconnection of secondary channels have led to restoration programmes and a growing interest in restoration ecology.Current restoration strategies in large river floodplains focus on the macroinvertebrate response related to the increases in lateral connectivity of the secondary channels. We constructed a framework to assess a gradient of hydrological connectivity among 13 secondary channels and the main channel of a large river, and we modelled the response of a set of macroinvertebrate metrics to this gradient. Comparisons between predicted and observed metrics in restored channels allowed us to measure the effect of an increase in the hydrological connectivity on the biological characteristics of macroinvertebrate assemblages.The pre-restoration framework enabled a clear ordering of channels into three types according to levels of hydrological connectivity. Rarefied richness and species traits, responding to the connectivity gradient, showed a net difference between disconnected channels and the main river channel. We were able to highlight a predation-colonization trade-off along the gradient of hydrological connectivity with a maximum colonization potential in the most connected channels.Post-restoration sampling showed deviations of the restored channels from their expected ecological state. A large proportion of colonizers were favoured by the restoration operations and non-native species occurred in the restored channels.Synthesis and applications. Macroinvertebrate biodiversity in large river floodplains is shaped by lateral hydrological connectivity. Increasing hydrological connectivity led to an increase in colonization rate. One year after restoration, the increase in lateral connectivity had shifted the restored sites away from the predicted state. This unpredictability is, in part, a consequence of the rapid colonization by non-native species of new habitats created by the restoration measures. We recommend that floodplain-scale restoration should focus on diversification of the hydrological connectivity of channels, thereby conserving a maximum of functional characteristics in macroinvertebrate communities.Show less"
22,"Sahoo, S",Apr 30 2019 ,A geomorphology-based integrated stream-aquifer interaction model for semi-gauged catchments,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Many of the existing stream-aquifer interaction models available in the literature are very complex with limited applicability in semi-gauged and ungauged catchments. In this study, to estimate the influent and effluent subsurface water fluxes under limited geo-hydrometeorological data availability conditions, a simple stream-aquifer interaction model, namely, the variable parameter McCarthy-Muskingum (VPMM) hillslopestorage Boussinesq (hsB) model, has been developed. This novel model couples the VPMM streamflow transport with the hsB groundwater flow transport modules in online mode. In this integrated model, the surface water-groundwater flux exchange process is modelled by the Darcian approach with the variable hydraulic heads between the river stage and groundwater table accounting for the rainfall forcing. Considering the exchange fluxes in the hyporheic zone and lateral overland flow contribution, this approach is field tested in a typical 48-km stretch of the Brahmani River in eastern India to simulate the streamflow and its depth with the minimum NashSutcliffe efficiency of 94% and 88%; the maximum root mean square error of 134 m3/s and 0.35 m; and the minimum index of agreement of 98% and 97%, respectively. This modelling approach could be very well utilized in data-scarce world-river basins to estimate the stream-aquifer exchange flux due to rainfall forcings.Show less"

25,"Dittinger, E",Feb 2018 ,Increased functional connectivity in the ventral and dorsal streams during retrieval of novel words in professional musicians,HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,"Current models of speech and language processing postulate the involvement of two parallel processing streams (the dual stream model): a ventral stream involved in mapping sensory and phonological representations onto lexical and conceptual representations and a dorsal stream contributing to sound-to-motor mapping, articulation, and to how verbal information is encoded and manipulated in memory. Based on previous evidence showing that music training has an influence on language processing, cognitive functions, and word learning, we examined EEG-based intracranial functional connectivity in the ventral and dorsal streams while musicians and nonmusicians learned the meaning of novel words through picture-word associations. In accordance with the dual stream model, word learning was generally associated with increased beta functional connectivity in the ventral stream compared to the dorsal stream. In addition, in the linguistically most demanding ""semantic task,"" musicians outperformed nonmusicians, and this behavioral advantage was accompanied by increased left-hemispheric theta connectivity in both streams. Moreover, theta coherence in the left dorsal pathway was positively correlated with the number of years of music training. These results provide evidence for a complex interplay within a network of brain regions involved in semantic processing and verbal memory functions, and suggest that intensive music training can modify its functional architecture leading to advantages in novel word learning.Show less"

In catchments where fine-grained sediment supply has increased since human disturbance, understanding sediment provenance and the (dis)connectivity of supply allows practitioners to target sediment source problems and treat them within catchment management plans.Release of alluvial fine-grained sediment from channel bank erosion since European settlement has resulted in the formation of a colmation layer along the upper Hunter River at Muswellbrook, eastern Australia. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) are used to determine the elemental and mineralogical signatures of colmation layer and floodplain sediment sources across this 4480 km(2) catchment. This sediment tracing technique is used to construct a picture of how suspended sediment supply and (dis) connectivity operates in this catchment. In this system, the primary source areas are subcatchments in which sediments are stored largely in partly confined floodplain pockets, but from which sediment supply is unimpeded and directly connected to the receiving reach. Subcatchments in which alluvial sediment storage is significant - and which contain large, laterally unconfined valleys - are essentially 'switched off' or disconnected from the receiving reach. This is because large sediment sinks act to trap fine-grained sediment before it reaches the receiving reach, forming a buffer along the sediment conveyor belt. Given the age structure of floodplains in the receiving reach, this pattern of source area contributions and (dis)connectivity must have occurred throughout the Holocene. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

27,"Jiang, QH",Jul 2022 ,N 2O dynamics in the hyporheic zone due to ripple migration,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The migration rate of ripples along the streambed has a profound effect on the hyporheic exchange and nitrogen dynamics. However, how the denitrification intermediate N2O is released in mobile bedforms still remain unclear. In this study, the ripple domains are established based on the sediment stability criteria by using the mean channel flow velocity U and the median sediment grain size D50. A two-dimensional numerical model coupling hyporheic flow, ripple migration and N2O transformation is proposed to investigate how ripple celerity affects N2O dynamics in streambeds. The results show that there are different patterns for the release of N2O from migrating ripples with different medium grain sizes D50 (0.06-0.3 mm). N2O can be released via upwelling of anoxic pore water from the deeper area in immobile or slow-mobile ripples. However, rapid ripple migration and the resulting fast vertical flow reversal can suppress the net pore water displacement and lead to the formation of a redox seal, which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area and inhibits N2O emissions. The magnitude of the nutrients concentration gradient and the N2O flux between these two areas depend only on the dispersive and diffusive transport. Therefore, the controls of N2O emission flux hence shift from the pumpingdominated regime in stable ripples to a grain size dominated regime of the migrating ripples. The possible implications about the effects of hydrodynamic changes due to the migration of ripples are presented. Our results emphasize that knowledge of N2O production-consumption hotspots within streambeds is essential to understand the mechanisms of N2O emissions from the sediment-water interface.Show less"
28,"Sarriquet, PE",Oct 2007 ,Effects of bottom sediment restoration on interstitial habitat characteristics and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in a headwater stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The restoration of in-stream habitats by structural improvement of stream beds is more and more frequent, but the ecological consequences of such works are still little known. We have examined the influence of the deposit of a 15 cm gravel layer over the stream bottom on the chemical characteristics of the interstitial water, the sediment grain size and the composition of the benthic assemblages. We have compared a restored reach to an upstream control over three years and at three seasons each year. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrite and nitrate contents were measured in both surface and interstitial (-15 cm deep) waters, together with the depth of anoxia estimated using wooden stakes and fine sediment content at the surface. During the same period and seasons, benthic invertebrates were sampled at five points in each reach. The restoration induced an increase in vertical exchanges of water between surface and interstitial habitats, with an increase in the depth of hypoxia. Changes were observed in the composition of invertebrate communities, but not in the density or in the taxonomic richness of assemblages. These changes in assemblages were fragile: a local disturbance (such as a drying period) diminished the beneficial effect of the restoration with the disappearance of several organisms. The viability of such restoration works may be associated with catchment management designed to reduce fine sediment inputs to the river. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
29,"Pineda-Morante, D",Mar 2022 ,Local hydrological conditions and spatial connectivity shape invertebrate communities after rewetting in temporary rivers,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Temporary rivers (TRs) dominate global river networks and are increasing in occurrence and spatiotemporal extent. However, few studies have investigated the communities that establish after rewetting events (i.e. the end of the dry phase), when local hydrological conditions can shape the communities through species sorting, and the spatial connectivity of sites can also influence colonisation. Here, we analysed the relative importance of both local hydrological conditions and spatial connectivity on the invertebrate communities of seven not impacted Mediterranean TRs after rewetting. We quantified the frequency and duration of drying events and the time since flow resumed. We also quantified spatial connectivity based on each site's position in the river network (i.e. network connectivity) and the presence of nearby disconnected streams. Overall, we found that both hydrological conditions and network connectivity played a significant role in structuring aquatic invertebrate communities after rewetting. Taxonomic richness, functional richness and functional redundancy decreased with the frequency and duration of drying events and increased with time since the most recent rewetting. Network connectivity showed a significant unimodal relationship with taxonomic and functional metrics. In contrast, the presence of nearby disconnected streams was negatively related to functional richness and functional dispersion. Given that flow intermittence in Mediterranean areas is expected to intensify under future global change scenarios, our results can be helpful to guide future conservation and management actions.Show less"
30,"Marle, P",Oct 2022 ,"Thermal regime, together with lateral connectivity, control aquatic invertebrate composition in river floodplains",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Large river floodplains are dynamic environments, where alternating low and high flows are key ecological processes shaping aquatic biota. As a result of fluctuations in flow in floodplain channels, the diversity of benthic assemblages is assumed to result from the balance between surface flow connections, which are dominant during high flows, and groundwater inputs, which are dominant during low flows. However, the relative importance of these inputs in explaining aquatic invertebrate diversity has never been tested. The response of aquatic invertebrates to hydrological changes of a river floodplain was investigated in seven braided and six braided-anastomosed floodplain channels of the French upper Rhone River that are fed by three different processes: groundwater supply (which controls the thermal inertia of the water bodies), surface slow flow connections (i.e. diffuse overbank flows; passive overflow), and surface shear stress-related connections (i.e. condensed flows; active overflow) during high flows. Generalised dissimilarity models indicated that floodplain invertebrate composition had complex relationships with the three processes considered. The relative importance of the latter appeared dependent upon the morphology of the floodplain channels. In the braided channels, the effects of shear stress-related connections were more prominent than in the anastomosed ones, for which the effects of the three processes were more similar. Overall, the diversity of flow connections, that is, lateral surface water connections (both shear stress-related and slow, as defined above) and vertical connection with groundwater (inferred through thermal inertia) enhanced the species turnover at the reach scale. Thermal inertia influenced invertebrate composition when, during low flow periods, surface flow connections had limited effect. Our results highlighted that the role of hydrologic connectivity upon floodplain diversity cannot be reduced to a single process. They also indicate the importance of vertical connectivity for maintaining biodiversity in floodplain habitats where surface flow connectivity is neither frequent nor constant.Show less"
31,"Geist, DR",Sep-oct 1998 ,Redd site selection and spawning habitat use by fall chinook salmon: The importance of geomorphic features in large rivers,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Knowledge of the three-dimensional connectivity between rivers and groundwater within the hyporheic zone can be used to improve the definition of fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning habitat. Information exists on the microhabitat characteristics that define suitable salmon spawning habitat. However, traditional spawning habitat models that use these characteristics to predict available spawning habitat are restricted because they can not account for the heterogeneous nature of rivers. We present a conceptual spawning habitat model for fall chinook salmon that describes how geomorphic features of river channels create hydraulic processes, including hyporheic flows, that influence where salmon spawn in unconstrained reaches of large mainstem alluvial rivers. Two case studies based on empirical data from fall chinook salmon spawning areas in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River are presented to illustrate important aspects of our conceptual model. We suggest that traditional habitat models and our conceptual model be combined to predict the limits of suitable fail chinook salmon spawning habitat. This approach can incorporate quantitative measures of river channel morphology, including general descriptors of geomorphic features at different spatial scales, in order to understand the processes influencing redd site selection and spawning habitat use. This information is needed in order to protect existing salmon spawning habitat in large rivers, as well as to recover habitat already lost.Show less"
32,"Ock, G",Oct 2015 ,"Ecological functions of restored gravel bars, the Trinity River, California",ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Gravel augmentation has been increasingly used in sediment-limited systems in regulated channels as a means of creating morphological changes that beneficially affect the functioning of downstream ecosystems. Despite this trend, there have been few empirical studies to quantify these effects in relation to the morphology of gravel bars, especially in terms of riverine material exchanges such as heat and organic matter. We conducted field-based hydro-geomorphological observation of different mechanisms of gravel bar restoration in the downstream of Trinity Dam, California: a medial and a point bar deposited fluvially during high-flow gravel injection, an additional point bar created by direct placement of gravel, and an island created by side channel excavation. We measured water temperature, suspended particulate organic matter (S-POM) concentration, hydraulic gradients and shallow water width under base flow conditions along the perimeter of the gravel features. We then assessed water temperature modulation derived from hyporheic exchanges and S-POM retention of the gravel features, comparing the functions of the dynamically-constructed medial and point bars to those of the mechanically-constructed island and point bar. Diurnal water temperature fluctuations showed a notable thermal heterogeneity including cooling (1.5-3.1 degrees C) during summer peak temperatures, buffering in amplitude (1.2-4.0 degrees C) and lagging in phase (0.3-14.5 h), especially in the bar-tails and alcoves of the gravel bars. All of the gravel features reduced S-POM concentration at baseflow, showing the highest retention efficiency in the medial bar. In addition, the fluvially formed the medial and point bars had higher hydraulic gradients and wider shallow waters than the constructed features. Our results indicate that gravel bar restoration can increase hyporheic exchange and S-POM retention by increasing hydraulic gradients at baseflow, refreshing bed materials to enhance substrate permeability, and elongating the wetted boundary length in shallow waters. Our study results suggest that mechanically created in-channel geomorphic features combined with coarse sediment augmentation can increase channel complexity, driving hyporheic flows and increasing S-POM retention, thus ultimately resulting in thermal heterogeneity and food availability along gravel bed channels.

33,"Kerr, PC",Aug 8 2013 ,The significance of model structure in one-dimensional stream solute transport models with multiple transient storage zones - competing vs. nested arrangements,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Transient storage models are commonly used to simulate solute transport in streams to characterize hydrologic controls on biogeochemical cycling. Recently, 2-storage zone (2-SZ) models have been developed to represent in-channel surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) separately to overcome the limitations of single storage zone (1-SZ) models. To advance biogeochemical models, we seek to separate the effects of these storage zones on solute fate and cycling in streams. Here we compare and contrast the application and interpretations from two model structures that include STS and HTS storage: a competing model structure, where both zones are connected to the stream at the same location and the stream interacts with the STS and HTS separately, and a nested model structure, where STS is an intermediary between the stream and HTS. We adapt common residence time metrics used to compare single transient storage models for the competing and nested 2-SZ models. As a test case, we investigated the transient storage characteristics of a first-order stream in Pennsylvania, using 1-SZ, nested 2-SZ, and competing 2-SZ model configurations at several different flow conditions. While both 2-SZ models fit the observed STS and in-stream breakthrough curves well, calibrated model parameters and solute molecule travel paths differ, as evident by the faster exchange rate displayed by the nested model, and therefore so does the interpretation of associated transient storage metrics and its relationship with biogeochemical cycling processes. In addition, a study of hypothetical zone-specific reaction rates was very illustrative of the differences in discrimination characterized by each model structure, particularly for the case where reactions would predominantly occur in the STS (i.e. photochemical reactions), because of the compounding effects to the HTS for the nested 2-SZ; however, for the case where reactions would predominantly occur in the HTS, the influence of model structure was found to be relegated only to the HTS.

The primary goal of the present research was to analyze the effect of water flow on macroinvertebrates in two water levels in a lateral connectivity gradient, from the main channel through a connection channel to a permanently connected lake. We tested the hypothesis that the water flow from the main channel to the floodplain habitats during high water level causes a decrease in beta diversity between the sites, increasing similarity in the system. To test this hypothesis, we sampled a river-floodplain-lake system of the Middle Parana River during two water levels, and analyzed the spatial and temporal turnover of species between sites and habitats. Local physical characteristics, such as depth, benthic particulate organic matter, and grain size of bottom sediments influenced assemblage composition. Taxa richness, density, and Shannon diversity differed among habitats within the river-lake system, but did not show significant differences between water levels. Richness, density, and diversity were higher in the lake and the connection channel than in the Parana River bank. Beta diversity was significantly higher during high water period. During low water period, benthic assemblage composition was homogenized, as reflected by the lower values of species turnover between the sites situated in the main channel-lake corridor during this phase. The lateral bidirectional exchanges among the habitats are essential for maintaining the specific invertebrate diversity of large river corridors.Show less"
35,"Linke, S",Oct 2012 ,Merging connectivity rules and large-scale condition assessment improves conservation adequacy in river systems,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Conservation adequacy is defined as the ability of conservation measures to sustain biodiversity. Although river network connectivity is important for maintaining key ecological processes and ensuring persistence of biodiversity, it also facilitates the propagation of threats along river networks, which may compromise the sustainability of freshwater biodiversity and therefore conservation adequacy. This study aims to introduce two modifications to river conservation planning related to connectivity and catchment condition that together can improve the adequacy of the priority areas identified. This will establish an operational framework for end-users, such as policy makers and NGOs. We operationalize the connectivity framework that has recently emerged in systematic river conservation planning by using a GIS coding system for catchment location in the conservation software package marxan. Additionally, we use a landscape measure of catchment disturbance to direct the conservation plan to the least-disturbed area while still meeting targets for the conservation of fish species used as surrogates for overall biodiversity in our study catchment, the Daly River in northern Australia. This proxy for condition aggregates information on land-use, extractive industries, point-source pollution, and water infrastructure. We successfully modelled the distribution of 39 fish species based on GIS-derived landscape descriptors (most important descriptors were; discharge, distance to river mouth, geology and conductivity). Results from the systematic planning analysis identified a portfolio of watersheds that delivered close to optimal upstream protection with around 4700 stream kilometres (30% of the total network). When using upstream disturbance as an extra penalty, most of the network stayed intact; however, a replacement area was found for a major tributary, which only added an extra 1% of the stream network to the total area. Synthesis and applications. Improving conservation adequacy by accounting for upstream connectivity and condition using this easy-to-implement framework and software package has the potential to facilitate further application of systematic methods in river conservation planning. Furthermore, integrating condition as a discounting factor can also improve conservation adequacy in a broad range of environments (including terrestrial and marine), while not necessarily increasing the management costs.Show less"
36,"Boano, F",Oct 24 2007 ,A continuous time random walk approach to the stream transport of solutes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The transport of solutes in rivers is influenced by the exchange of water between the river and the underlying hyporheic zone. The residence times of solutes in the hyporheic zone are typically much longer than traveltimes in the stream, resulting in a significant delay in the downstream propagation of solutes. A new model for this process is proposed here on the basis of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW is a generalization of the classic random walk that can include arbitrary distributions of waiting times, and it is particularly suited to deal with the long residence times arising from hyporheic exchange. Inclusion of suitable hyporheic residence time distributions in the CTRW leads to a generalized advection-dispersion equation for instream concentration breakthrough curves that includes the effects of specific hyporheic exchange processes. Here examples are presented for advective hyporheic exchange resulting from regular and irregular series of bedforms. A second major advantage of the CTRW approach is that the combined effects of different processes affecting overall downstream transport can be incorporated in the model by convolving separate waiting time distributions for each relevant process. The utility of this approach is illustrated by analyzing the effects of local-scale sediment heterogeneity on bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. The ability to handle arbitrarily wide residence time distributions and the ability to assess the combined effects of multiple transport processes makes the CTRW model framework very useful for the study of solute transport problems in rivers. The model presented here can be easily extended to represent different types of surface-subsurface exchange processes and the transport of both conservative and nonconservative substances in rivers.Show less"

The ICF index: A river connectivity index and its application to Catalan rivers,LIMNETICA,"Longitudinal connectivity in hydromorphological quality assessments of rivers. The ICF index: A river connectivity index and its application to Catalan riversThe Water Framework Directive urges assessment of river continuity as an input for the evaluation of hydromorphological quality. The existence of transverse obstacles in river beds has serious ecological consequences because it blocks the natural flow of water, sediments and biota, and this is considered one of the major causes of declines in many continental fish species.The index of river connectivity (ICF, from the Catalan name Index de Connectivitat Fluvial) evaluates obstacle effects on fish movement alone and does not take into account other elements affected by the obstacles. However, it can be used as a complementary element in hydromorphological condition assessments. The index is based on comparison of obstacle and fish pass (if any) characteristics with the capabilities of the fishes potentially present in the considered river section to overcome the obstacle. In this study, we present a new version of the ICF improved from its earlier version that was tested by different consultants and research centres for several obstacles from 2006 to 2009. The new version of the ICF is divided into three blocks that encompass assessment of (1) the obstacle and (2) the fish pass (if any) as well as (3) the estimation of certain modulators. Finally, the ICF classifies connectivity into five levels from very good to had depending on the degree of permeability for different fish groups. This new version of the ICF has been tested for 101 transverse obstacles in rivers in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula) both with and without fish passes, obtaining representation of the five expected quality levels (from very good to bad), and it is considered coherent with the real permeability of the obstacles. Its ease of application compared to in situ measurements of fish movements and the detailed information recorded by the index make it a very useful tool for the diagnosis of the longitudinal connectivity of rivers and for guiding measures for hydromorphological quality improvement.Show less"
38,"McDonough, OT",Feb 2015 ,Surface Hydrologic Connectivity Between Delmarva Bay Wetlands and Nearby Streams Along a Gradient of Agricultural Alteration,WETLANDS,"Although recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings indicate surface hydrologic connectivity (SHC) between geographically isolated wetlands and nearby streams may be used, in part, to determine wetland jurisdictional status, and ecologic implications are considerable regardless of policies, wetland-stream SHC has rarely been quantified. Furthermore, the impact of cultivation and restoration on wetland-stream SHC is largely unknown. To help fill these knowledge gaps, we recorded SHC patterns during water year 2010 in non-perennial streams connecting Delmarva bay wetlands, which are commonly considered geographically isolated, and nearby perennial streams. We also evaluated how hydrologic wetland restoration impacts SHC relative to historical wetlands and native forested wetlands. Cumulative connection duration, number of connectivity transitions, mean connection duration, and maximum individual connection duration (D (max-c) ) were quantified. Forested wetlands were connected to perennial streams for a greater cumulative duration but exhibited fewer connectivity transitions relative to both historical and restored wetlands. SHC between historical and restored wetlands and nearby perennial streams did not differ with respect to any of the calculated metrics. Forested wetland-stream SHC was seasonally intermittent, exhibiting stream outflow from mid-fall to late-spring during periods of low evapotranspiration and elevated groundwater levels but lacking connectivity during summer months when evapotranspiration and groundwater were at an annual high and low, respectively. Historical and restored wetland-stream SHC was largely ephemeral, occurring in response to antecedent rainfall, particularly during winter and spring. Stepwise regression models describe cumulative connection duration and D (max-c) as a function of wetland, watershed, and non-perennial stream metrics including watershed relief, non-perennial stream slope, non-perennial stream length, and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity. Wetland-stream SHC has potential ecological implications, including provision of dispersal corridors for biota, biogeochemical processing of nutrients, and downstream delivery of energy, matter, and organisms, and is currently tied to wetland regulatory status in the U.S.Show less"
39,"Datry, T",Sep 2015 ,Estimation of Sediment Hydraulic Conductivity in River Reaches and its Potential Use to Evaluate Streambed Clogging,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Streambed substrates have pervasive effects on stream biodiversity and biogeochemistry. The excessive input of fine sediments in streams and the subsequent alteration of the physical characteristics of streambed substrates are considered today as a major environmental issue. The estimation of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) may be simpler than other estimations of reach-scale physical characteristics and could serve to quantify the alterations of streambeds across stream networks. In this study, we examined between-reach and within-reach variability and temporal changes of streambed K across 101 stream reaches in France, including nine reaches previously judged as clogged and nine as references (unclogged). We also examined the relationships between K and some environmental variables such as vertical hydraulic gradient, streambed grain size, flow velocity or distance to the bank. We demonstrated that 15 measurements of streambed K per reach could be used to compare streams among each other and over time. Clogged reaches displayed much lower K than reference reaches, and more generally, reach-averaged K and the number of non-null K values per reach allowed discriminating reaches among each other without observer bias. K was higher in upwelling compared with downwelling areas, probably because of fine sediment uplifting. With the low cost in terms of equipment (stream monitoring networks such as clogging, but also for understanding large-scale drivers of these alterations, or for upscaling recent developments in hyporheic ecology at the reach scale.

Some streams draining Catskill catchments have shown dramatic increases in nitrate concentrations while others have maintained low nitrate concentrations. Streams in which exchange occurs between surface and subsurface (i.e. hyporheic) waters are thought to be conducive to nitrate removal via microbial assimilation and/or denitrification. Hyporheic exchange was documented in the Neversink River in the southern Catskill Mountains, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) losses along hyporheic flowpaths were negligible. In this study, Neversink River water was amended with natural, bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) (leaf leachate) in a series of experimental mesocosms that simulated hyporheic flowpaths. DOC and N dynamics were examined before and throughout a three week BDOC amendment. In addition, bacterial production, dissolved oxygen demand, denitrification, and six extracellular enzyme activities were measured to arrive at a mechanistic understanding of potential DOC and NO3- removal along hyporheic flowpaths. There were marked declines in DOC and complete removal of nitrate in the BDOC amended mesocosms. Independent approaches were used to partition NO3- loss into two fractions: denitrification and assimilation. Microbial assimilation appears to be the predominant process explaining N loss. These results suggest that variability in BDOC may contribute to temporal differences in NO3- export from streams in the Catskill Mountains.Show less"

THE CASE OF A RIVER WITH FUNCTIONAL FLOODPLAIN,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The floodplain of the river Ill in the Alsace Rhine valley is used as a model to study river-groundwater exchange process. Groundwater-fed streams located in the Ill floodplain are analysed using three methods: an analytical method based on hydrochemical variables (Cl-, NO3-, PO43- and NH4+), a phytosociological one based on surveys of aquatic macrophyte communities and a biological method based on the accumulation of mercury in the moss Fontinalis antipyretica. The results show that the eutrophicated and polluted river Ill (660 mug l-1 N-NH4+, 500 mug l-1 P-PO43-, 0.3-0.4 mg Hg kg-1 dry weight of moss) has a negative effect on the groundwater via the bed, depending on the level of the river bed in relation to the groundwater table level. Upstream of Colmar in the south of the Alsace floodplain, the Ill waters infiltrate and contaminate the groundwater, but this is not the case further downstream. Along a stretch of the Ill (40 km) annual floods provide eutrophicated and polluted waters to the aquifer. However these waters are purified during their transfer through the soil-vegetation system. Thus in the groundwater-fed streams the water is characterised by a low level of phosphate, ammonium nitrogen and mercury(10-20 mug l-1 N-NH4+ and P-PO43-, < 0.05 mg Hg kg-1 dry weight of moss). We demonstrate the importance of a functional floodplain in replenishing the aquifer with poor-nutrient waters. The aquatic vegetation of groundwater-fed streams reflects the water quality and thus can be used as a bioindicator and descriptor of river-groundwater exchange process.Show less"
42,"Xian, Y",Oct 2021 ,On River-Aquifer Exchange Flow With Irregular and Semipervious Bank,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"River water flowing into and out of riparian aquifers driven by stage fluctuations during floods is critical for streamflow and biogeochemical cycling of hyporheic zones. Previous studies paid limited attention to the complex exchange flow between rivers and the adjacent unconfined aquifers through irregular and semipervious banks which are commonly seen in nature. This study proposed a new semi-analytical solution for describing the river-aquifer exchange flow by incorporating river stage hydrograph, and semipervious banks with irregular geometries. The solution was verified by comparing with the numerical solutions of the one-dimensional Boussinesq equation and two-dimensional variably saturated flow models. The comparisons indicated that the semi-analytical solution was robust to closely approximate the bank storage exchange flow through an irregular and semipervious bank. Moreover, an innovative dimensionless river bank index (BI) was proposed to quantitively identify the importance of riverbank geometry irregularity. BI = 0.4 and BI = 0.76 are the critical threshold values to determine whether realistic bank geometry should be incorporated or not. Specifically, when BI is less than 0.4, the conventionally vertical bank can be applied to substitute realistic irregular riverbanks; When BI is greater than 0.76, however, realistic bank geometries should be included and otherwise significant errors may occur, especially when BI is much greater than 0.76. The semi-analytical solution and BI have been successfully applied to the Hanford Reach of Columbia River, Washington, USA. The proposed solution and BI are useful for conceptual and diagnostic analysis of bank storage exchange flow and for understanding which factors and responses are important.Show less"

Diminished ecological infrastructure can result in a reduced ability to retain water and soil that will impede ecosystem health and sustainable use of land and water resources. In the northern Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, the headwaters of the Mzimvubu River, land use change and land degradation over the past 50-100 years has initiated increased sediment connectivity through features such as gullies and incised river channels. The water resources of this catchment are largely undeveloped, but future development will be threatened by high suspended sediment loads. The Vuvu catchment, a headwater tributary of the larger Mzimvubu River system, is used as a case study to assess how hillslope-channel and channel-valley fill sediment connectivity has changed over the past 100 years. From detailed mapping of gullies, roads and livestock tracks, it was concluded that downslope connectivity added 22% and across-slope drainage 159% to the drainage network. As a result of increased drainage efficiency, the main channel was incised and straightened, in turn reducing channel-valley fill connectivity. A conceptual model of changes to sediment connectivity is presented with recommendations for future restoration. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"

However, their role in attenuating nutrient loads of rivers receiving point source nutrient inputs (e.g., from wastewater treatment plants, WWTPs) is still little understood. Here, we investigated whether ammonium (NH4-N), nitrate (NO3-N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) retention were influenced by the riparian land use in three Brazilian rivers receiving WWTP effluents. We hypothesized that nutrient attenuation would be potentially influenced by the hydrological connectivity between the main channel and riparian areas with native vegetation. We estimated retention from longitudinal patterns of dilution-corrected nutrient concentrations below the WWTPs. We assessed nutrient retention during periods with high (i.e., the wet) and low connectivity (i.e., the dry season). Relationships between non-conservative (nutrients) and conservative (chloride) solutes in both seasons were used to identify potential changes in the river chemistry due to the hydrological connectivity with the riparian areas. We also evaluated the relationship between net uptake velocities (Vf-net) and the accumulated percent native vegetation cover in the 100-m buffer using linear regressions, comparing the response for each nutrient between seasons with Analysis of Covariance. Slopes of regressions between nutrients and chloride significantly differed between seasons for NO3-N and SRP but not for NH4-N. The relationships between Vf-net and accumulated native vegetation in the riparian buffer presented steeper slopes for SRP in the wet than in the dry season. No significant relationships between NO3-N Vf-net and native vegetation cover were observed in either season. In contrast, increases in Vf-net with increasing vegetation cover were observed for NH4-N in the dry season. In periods with expected higher connectivity, NO3-N and SRP concentrations tended to be lower relative to chloride concentrations, with a potential effect of native vegetation in the riparian area on SRP retention. Our results suggest that seasonal connectivity between nutrient-rich river water and riparian areas is likely to induce changes in the predominant nutrient transformation processes, thereby favoring either nutrient retention or export in such rivers.Show less"
46,"Konrad, CP",Oct 15 2006 ,Location and timing of river-aquifer exchanges in six tributaries to the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The flow of water between rivers and contiguous aquifers influences the quantity and quality of water resources, particularly in regions where precipitation and runoff are unevenly distributed through the year, such as the Columbia Basin (CB) in northwestern United States. Investigations of basin hydrogeology and gains and losses of streamflow for six rivers in the CB were reviewed to characterize general patterns in the timing and location of river-aquifer exchanges at a reach-scale (0.5-150 km) and to identify geologic and geomorphic features associated with the largest exchanges. Ground-water discharge to each river, or the gain in streamflow, was concentrated spatially: more than one-half of the total gains along each river segment were contributed from reaches that represented no more than 30% of the total segment length with the largest and most concentrated gains in rivers in volcanic terrains. Fluvial recharge of aquifers, or losses of streamflow, was largest in rivers in sedimentary basins where unconsolidated sediments form shallow aquifers. Three types of geologic or geomorphic features were associated with the largest exchanges: (1) changes in the thickness of unconsolidated aquifers; (2) contacts between lithologic units that represent contrasts in permeability; and (3) channel forms that increase the hydraulic gradient or cross-sectional area of flow paths between a river and shallow ground-water. The down-valley component of ground-water flow and its vertical convergence on or divergence from a riverbed account for large streamflow gains in some reaches and contrast with the common assumption of lateral ground-water discharge to a river that penetrates completely through the aquifer. Increased ground-water discharge was observed during high-flow periods in reaches of four rivers indicating that changes in ground-water levels can be more important than stage fluctuations in regulating the direction and magnitude of river-aquifer exchanges and that assumptions about ground-water discharge during high flow periods used for base-flow separation must be verified. Given the variety of geologic terrains in the CB, the spatial and temporal patterns of river-aquifer exchanges provide a framework for investigations in other regions that includes a focus on reaches where the largest exchanges are likely to occur, integration of ground-water and surface-water data, and verification of assumptions regarding ground-water flow direction and temporal variation of exchanges.

47,"Li, YY",2020 ,CHANGE CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE YANGTZE RIVER AND THE DONGTING LAKE DURING 1960-2018 IN CHINA,APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,"Hydrological exchange between the trunk stream and the floodplains is the key factor maintaining ecological functioning. The water discharge diverting from the Yangtze River to the Dongting Lake has recently decreased considerably in China However, their variation characteristics and major driving factors remained unclear. In this study, Mann Kendall trend and Pettitt abrupt tests were employed to determine the changes of time series. Double mass curve analysis and regression analysis were used for the qualitative analysis of the impacts of climate change and human activity. Results revealed that precipitation change trends significantly decreased in autumn. The water discharge at the trunk Yangtze River had a decreasing trend in autumn and an increasing trend in winter. The annual and seasonal water discharge diverting from the Yangtze River to the Dongting Lake, except at Xinjiangkou in summer, exhibited significant downward trends. No consistent trends in precipitation and water discharge were identified, thereby indicating that the seasonal relationships between them had been disturbed by human activities. Human activities had a dominant effect on the water discharge exchange between them during 1967-2018. Along with the intensification of human activities, the hydrological connectivity between the Yangtze River and the Dongting Lake would probably be further changed in the near future.Show less"
48,"Fang, YL",Aug 7 2020 ,A multirate mass transfer model to represent the interaction of multicomponent biogeochemical processes between surface water and hyporheic zones (SWAT-MRMT-R 1.0),GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT,"Surface water quality along river corridors can be modulated by hyporheic zones (HZs) that are ubiquitous and biogeochemically active. Watershed management practices often ignore the potentially important role of HZs as a natural reactor. To investigate the effect of hydrological exchange and biogeochemical processes on the fate of nutrients in surface water and HZs, a novel model, SWAT-MRMT-R, was developed coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model and the reaction module from a flow and reactive transport code (PFLOTRAN). SWAT-MRMT-R simulates concurrent nonlinear multicomponent biogeochemical reactions in both the channel water and its surrounding HZs, connecting the channel water and HZs through hyporheic exchanges using multirate mass transfer (MRMT) representation. Within the model, HZs are conceptualized as transient storage zones with distinguished exchange rates and residence times. The biogeochemical processes within HZs are different from those in the channel water. Hyporheic exchanges are modeled as multiple first-order mass transfers between the channel water and HZs. As a numerical example, SWAT-MRMT-R is applied to the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River, a large river in the United States, focusing on nitrate dynamics in the channel water. Major nitrate contaminants entering the Hanford Reach include those from the legacy waste, irrigation return flows (irrigation water that is not consumed by crops and runs off as point sources to the stream), and groundwater seepage resulting from irrigated agriculture. A two-step reaction sequence for denitrification and an aerobic respiration reaction is assumed to represent the biogeochemical transformations taking place within the HZs. The spatially variable hyporheic exchange rates and residence times in this example are estimated with the basin-scale Networks with EXchange and Subsurface Storage (NEXSS) model. Our simulation results show that (1), given a residence time distribution, how the exchange fluxes to HZs are approximated when using MRMT can significantly change the amount of nitrate consumption in HZs through denitrification and (2) source locations of nitrate have a different impact on surface water quality due to the spatially variable hyporheic exchanges.Show less"
49,"Liu, Q",Sep 2017 ,Effects of Hyporheic Water Fluxes and Sediment Grain Size on the Concentration and Diffusive Flux of Heavy Metals in the Streambed,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"The hyporheic zone regulates physicochemical processes in surface-groundwater systems and can be an important source of heavy metals in fluvial systems. This study assesses the pore water concentrations and diffusive fluxes of heavy metals with respect to the vertical water exchange flux (VWEF) and sediment grain size. Water and sediment samples were collected on August 2016 from upstream Site 1 and downstream Site 2 along the Juehe River in Shaanxi Province, China. Streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) and the VWEF were estimated via the standpipe permeameter test method and Darcy's law. The heavy metal concentrations in the pore water were measured and the diffusive fluxes were calculated using Fick's first law. The VWEF patterns were dominated by upward flow, and Site 1 featured higher values of Kv and VWEF. Higher Cu and Zn concentrations occurred near the channel centre with coarse sand and gravel and greater upward VWEFs because coarser sediment and greater upward VWEFs cause stronger metal desorption capacity. Additionally, Cu and Zn at the two sites generally diffused from pore water to surface water, potentially due to the upward VWEF. The VWEF and sediment grain size are likely crucial factors influencing the heavy metal concentrations and diffusive fluxes.Show less"
