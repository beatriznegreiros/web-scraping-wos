In a previous study, we showed that spatial variation in local current velocities and degrees of hydrological exchange creates a patch-work mosaic of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and ratios in the Upper Mississippi River. Here, we used long-term fish and limnological data sets to test the hypothesis that fish communities differ between the previously identified patches defined by high or low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios (TN:TP) and to determine the extent to which select limnological covariates might explain those differences. Species considered as habitat generalists were common in both patch types but were at least 2 times as abundant in low TN:TP patches. Dominance by these species resulted in lower diversity in low TN:TP patches, whereas an increased relative abundance of a number of rheophilic (flow-dependent) species resulted in higher diversity and a more even species distribution in high TN:TP patches. Of the limnological variables considered, the strongest predictor of fish species assemblage and diversity was water flow velocity, indicating that spatial patterns in water-mediated connectivity may act as the main driver of both local nutrient concentrations and fish community composition in these reaches. The coupling among hydrology, biogeochemistry, and biodiversity in these river reaches suggests that landscape-scale restoration projects that manipulate hydrogeomorphic patterns may also modify the spatial mosaic of nutrients and fish communities.

1,"Wang, PX",Jun 2021 ,Simulating Water and Pollution Exports from Soil to Stream during the Thawing Period at the Small River Basin Scale,WATER,"A physical model was developed to describe the soil-to-stream export processes of water and pollutants in a small river basin during the soil thawing period. The hydrological and pollution transport and transformation behaviors in paddy- and corn-dominated catchments were numerically simulated; the impacts of the pollution concentrations, interactions between the migrated water and pollutants in the soil, and pollutant transformations during the pollution export were coupled. Experimental field data from the Heidingzi river basin during the soil thawing period were used to calibrate the model parameters and evaluate the performance. The mass of the dissolved pollutants from soil particles in the migrated soil pore water was the key factor affecting the pollution export into the streams; the water content directly affected the pollution export. The concentration of the pollutants peaked when the initial exported water was high. The pollutant transport processes influenced the pollution export more significantly after the soil water was significantly reduced. The N-S efficiency coefficients between the simulated and monitored flow rates and the pollution concentrations at the outlets of the paddy- and corn-dominated catchments were >0.60 and >0.54, respectively. The system deviations between the simulated and monitored flow rates and the pollution concentrations were <10% and <15%, respectively. The proposed model effectively described the water flow, pollution transport and transformation processes.Show less"
2,"Landguth, EL",Sep 2014 ,Combining demographic and genetic factors to assess population vulnerability in stream species,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Accelerating climate change and other cumulative stressors create an urgent need to understand the influence of environmental variation and landscape features on the connectivity and vulnerability of freshwater species. Here, we introduce a novel modeling framework for aquatic systems that integrates spatially explicit, individual-based, demographic and genetic (demogenetic) assessments with environmental variables. To show its potential utility, we simulated a hypothetical network of 19 migratory riverine populations (e.g., salmonids) using a riverscape connectivity and demogenetic model (CDFISH). We assessed how stream resistance to movement (a function of water temperature, fluvial distance, and physical barriers) might influence demogenetic connectivity, and hence, population vulnerability. We present demographic metrics (abundance, immigration, and change in abundance) and genetic metrics (diversity, differentiation, and change in differentiation), and combine them into a single vulnerability index for identifying populations at risk of extirpation. We considered four realistic scenarios that illustrate the relative sensitivity of these metrics for early detection of reduced connectivity: (1) maximum resistance due to high water temperatures throughout the network, (2) minimum resistance due to low water temperatures throughout the network, (3) increased resistance at a tributary junction caused by a partial barrier, and (4) complete isolation of a tributary, leaving resident individuals only. We then applied this demogenetic framework using empirical data for a bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) metapopulation in the upper Flathead River system, Canada and USA, to assess how current and predicted future stream warming may influence population vulnerability. Results suggest that warmer water temperatures and associated barriers to movement (e.g., low flows, dewatering) are predicted to fragment suitable habitat for migratory salmonids, resulting in the loss of genetic diversity and reduced numbers in certain vulnerable populations. This demogenetic simulation framework, which is illustrated in a web-based interactive mapping prototype, should be useful for evaluating population vulnerability in a wide variety of dendritic and fragmented riverscapes, helping to guide conservation and management efforts for freshwater species.Show less"
3,"Laudon, H",Sep 2011 ,"Patterns and Dynamics of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) in Boreal Streams: The Role of Processes, Connectivity, and Scaling",ECOSYSTEMS,"We bring together three decades of research from a boreal catchment to facilitate an improved mechanistic understanding of surface water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) regulation across multiple scales. The Krycklan Catchment Study encompasses 15 monitored nested research catchments, ranging from 3 to 6900 ha in size, as well as a set of monitored transects of forested and wetland soils. We show that in small homogenous catchments, hydrological functioning provides a first order control on the temporal variability of stream water DOC. In larger, more heterogeneous catchments, stream water DOC dynamics are regulated by the combined effect of hydrological mechanisms and the proportion of major landscape elements, such as wetland and forested areas. As a consequence, streams with heterogeneous catchments undergo a temporal switch in the DOC source. In a typical boreal catchment covered by 10-20% wetlands, DOC originates predominantly from wetland sources during low flow conditions. During high flow, the major source of DOC is from forested areas of the catchment. We demonstrate that by connecting knowledge about DOC sources in the landscape with detailed hydrological process understanding, an improved representation of stream water DOC regulation can be provided. The purpose of this study is to serve as a framework for appreciating the role of regulating mechanisms, connectivity and scaling for understanding the pattern and dynamics of surface water DOC across complex landscapes. The results from this study suggest that the sensitivity of stream water DOC in the boreal landscape ultimately depends on changes within individual landscape elements, the proportion and connectivity of these affected landscape elements, and how these changes are propagated downstream.Show less"
4,"Schmid, BH",Nov 2010 ,Characterizing solute transport with transient storage across a range of flow rates: The evidence of repeated tracer experiments in Austrian and Italian streams,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Solute transport in rivers and streams with hyporheic zone exchange and/or in-stream storage is typically affected by the prevailing flow rate. The research reported here focuses on stream tracer experiments repeated many times along the same Austrian (Modlingbach) and Italian (Torrente Lura) channel reaches to characterize parameter dependency on flow rate. Both groups of data sets showed an increase of storage zone area and main stream area with discharge. In either case, a strong negative correlation was obtained between storage zone residence time and flow rate. From the Modlingbach data, no clear relationship with Q emerged for the dispersion coefficient and the dead zone ratio, whereas Torrente Lura showed a clear positive correlation of the dispersion coefficient with the flow rate and a slightly negative Q-dependency for the dead zone ratio. Modlingbach and Torrente Lura results are presented against the background of other repeat experiments reported in literature.In practical applications, the computation of peak concentrations frequently rests on the transfer of transport parameters from one flow rate to another. Using the above Austrian and Italian data sets it was shown that the errors in simulated Modlingbach peak concentrations remain within a 40% margin, if the ratio of flow rates (for calibration and simulation, resp.) does not exceed 2:1. With Torrente Lura, parameter transfer resulted in somewhat lower peak errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
5,"Becker, P",Feb 17 2019 ,The reform of European cohesion policy or how to couple the streams successfully,JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION,"Cohesion policy is one of the European Union's central spending policies, which is characterized by path-dependency and only incremental change. However, the policy has been reformed significantly in 2013. This case study sets out to trace this ground-breaking and significant reform in a fairly path-dependent environment by using Kingdon's multiple streams approach (MSA).The approach is adapted to the characteristics of policy-making in the European Union, the particularities of the Union's multilevel governance with its institutionalized and well-practised policy-making and almost predictable policy windows. The modified approach helps to separate two windows of opportunity with two different policy entrepreneurs. The first agenda window with the European Commission as entrepreneur prepared the grounds for the decision window with an entrepreneurial group of Member States. The second coupling reframed and refocused the proposals of the agenda coupling and linked cohesion policy more closely with the Union's economic policy co-ordination.Show less"
6,"Ryan, RJ",Oct 5 2010 ,Variation in surface water-groundwater exchange with land use in an urban stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A suite of methods is being utilized in the Baltimore metropolitan area to develop an understanding of the interaction between groundwater and surface water at multiple space and time scales. As part of this effort, bromide tracer experiments were conducted over two 10-day periods in August 2007 and May 2008 along two sections (each approximately 900 m long) of Dead Run, a small urban stream located in Baltimore County, Maryland, to investigate the influence of distinct zones of riparian land cover on surface-subsurface exchange and transient storage under low and high baseflow conditions. Riparian land cover varied by reach along a gradient of land use spanning parkland, suburban/residential, commercial, institutional, and transportation, and included wooded, meadow, turf grass, and impervious cover.Under summer low baseflow conditions, surface water-groundwater exchange, defined by gross inflow and gross outflow, was larger and net inflow (gross inflow minus gross outflow) had greater spatial variability, than was observed under spring high baseflow conditions. In addition, the fraction of nominal travel time attributable to transient storage (F(med)) was lower and was more spatially variable under high baseflow conditions than under low baseflow conditions. The influence of baseflow condition on surface water-ground water exchange and transient storage was most evident in the subreaches with the least riparian forest cover and these effects are attributed to a lack of shading in reaches with little riparian forest cover. We suggest that under summer low baseflow conditions, the lack of shading allowed excess in-channel vegetation growth which acted as a transient storage zone and a conduit for outflow (i.e. uptake and evapotranspiration). Under spring high baseflow conditions the transient storage capacity of the channel was reduced because there was little in-channel vegetation. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
7,"Sarremejane, R",Dec 2019 ,Biological indices to characterize community responses to drying in streams with contrasting flow permanence regimes,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Many river networks include temporary reaches that stop flowing and may dry during unpredictable droughts (near-perennial) or more frequently (intermittent). A few biological indices have been developed to assess invertebrate community responses to hydrological variability, including the instream conditions associated with drought, but their performance in temporary streams remains poorly known. We evaluated the ability of two such indices, the Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE) and the Drought Effect of Habitat Loss on Invertebrates (DEHLI), to predict responses to flow cessation and drying in temporary streams with contrasting flow permanence regimes. We used a 26-year dataset comprising spring-season invertebrate community samples and daily discharge measurements from 46 sites in a cool, wet temperate region, to examine relationships between hydrological variables and changes in index scores. We also identified taxon-specific thresholds at which occurrence changed with increasing drying and flowing durations. Both indices effectively characterized responses to increasing no-flow durations. DEHLI also reflected community changes following flow resumptions, identified differences in responses among flow permanence groups, and was particularly able to predict community responses at near-perennial sites. DEHLI scores at near-perennial sites took on average three years after a drying event to return to values typical of perennial sites, whereas responses to increasing flow duration were more erratic at intermittent sites. Lotic specialists declined whereas lentic and semi-aquatic taxa increased in occurrence with no-flow duration after summers with < 50 days without flow, due to changes in the availability of preferred habitat types. Community responses to drying events were less predictable among intermittent than near-perennial sites, likely because differences in habitat conditions and connectivity may lead intermittent communities to harbour contrasting pools of species with strategies that promote persistence during and/or recolonization after drying. We identify DEHLI as an index that can characterize community responses to drying in temporary streams with contrasting flow permanence regimes. We also recommend the development of new indices that include lentic, semi-aquatic and terrestrial as well as lotic taxa, to more comprehensively describe and predict community responses to changing instream conditions.Show less"
8,"Sakamaki, T",Aug 2013 ,Nonlinear variation of stream-forest linkage along a stream-size gradient: an assessment using biogeochemical proxies of in-stream fine particulate organic matter,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"1. Spatial scale of processes is necessary information to design appropriate ecosystem research and management. In-stream ecological processes are tightly linked with their adjacent terrestrial environment and impacted by modifications of riparian environments, particularly in small, forested streams. Quantitative understanding of how the dynamic coupling of these adjacent ecosystems varies along stream continua is necessary to enhance stream research and management. 2. In temperate, forest-dominated watersheds of British Columbia, Canada, we examined the stream-forest linkage along a stream-size gradient based on biogeochemical analysis of fine particulate organic matter retained in streambed sediment (FPOMS). We analysed FPOMS at 48 stations in 14 cobble-bed streams from 22 to 39m bankfull widths during summer low-flow conditions and tested their relationships with local, forest-related, environmental factors (light penetration, benthic coarse POM biomass, riparian-soil properties) along the stream-size gradient. 3. Carbon/nitrogen ratio of FPOMS (FPOMS-C/N) was distinctly lower in stream bankfull widths larger than an estimated threshold around 76m and corresponded with decrease in N/chlorophyll a of FPOMS and inorganic nitrogen concentration. We found significant linkages of FPOMS-C/N with local streamside environments in streams narrower than the threshold (but not in widths stream nitrogen cycling by algae and consistently lowered FPOMS-C/N regardless of streamside environment. These indicate a nonlinear attenuation of the strength of linkage between in-stream biogeochemical processes and forest-related environments along the stream-size gradient. 4. Synthesis and applications. The relationship of biogeochemical proxies of in-stream fine particulate organic matter with local environments can be a practical tool for measuring the strength of stream-forest linkage. Furthermore, regional- and stream-specific threshold stream widths dividing in-stream biogeochemical regimes can be an important landmark for ecologists and managers to refine designs for stream research and management at appropriate spatial scales. For stream widths narrower than a threshold, reach-scale linkages between stream and terrestrial environments can be a major focus, and riparian conditions need to be carefully managed to protect stream habitats. For stream widths wider than a threshold, catchment impacts on streams at larger spatial scales would be a more important focusShow less"
9,"Fullerton, AH",Nov 2010 ,Hydrological connectivity for riverine fish: measurement challenges and research opportunities,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"P>1. In this review, we first summarize how hydrologic connectivity has been studied for riverine fish capable of moving long distances, and then identify research opportunities that have clear conservation significance. Migratory species, such as anadromous salmonids, are good model organisms for understanding ecological connectivity in rivers because the spatial scale over which movements occur among freshwater habitats is large enough to be easily observed with available techniques; they are often economically or culturally valuable with habitats that can be easily fragmented by human activities; and they integrate landscape conditions from multiple surrounding catchment(s) with in-river conditions. Studies have focussed on three themes: (i) relatively stable connections (connections controlled by processes that act over broad spatio-temporal scales > 1000 km2 and > 100 years); (ii) dynamic connections (connections controlled by processes acting over fine to moderate spatio-temporal scales similar to 1-1000 km2 and < 1-100 years); and (iii) anthropogenic influences on hydrologic connectivity, including actions that disrupt or enhance natural connections experienced by fish.2. We outline eight challenges to understanding the role of connectivity in riverine fish ecology, organized under three foci: (i) addressing the constraints of river structure; (ii) embracing temporal complexity in hydrologic connectivity; and (iii) managing connectivity for riverine fishes. Challenges include the spatial structure of stream networks, the force and direction of flow, scale-dependence of connectivity, shifting boundaries, complexity of behaviour and life histories and quantifying anthropogenic influence on connectivity and aligning management goals. As we discuss each challenge, we summarize relevant approaches in the literature and provide additional suggestions for improving research and management of connectivity for riverine fishes.3. Specifically, we suggest that rapid advances are possible in the following arenas: (i) incorporating network structure and river discharge into analyses; (ii) increasing explicit consideration of temporal complexity and fish behaviour in the scope of analyses; and (iii) parsing degrees of human and natural influences on connectivity and defining acceptable alterations. Multiscale analyses are most likely to identify dominant patterns of connections and disconnections, and the appropriate scale at which to focus conservation activities.Show less"
10,"Lu, M",Dec 2020 ,Measuring the hydrological longitudinal connectivity and its spatial response on urbanization in delta plains,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The variations of hydrological longitudinal connectivity are influenced by natural factors and human activities in the delta plain where many sluices are distributed in. Measuring the longitudinal connectivity changed by human controls (i.e. sluices) is still an open question. Besides, the spatial relationship between the longitudinal connectivity and urbanization is not clear. To this end, a reasonable indicator (Sluice Longitudinal Connectivity Index, SLCI), composed of sluice passage probability, passage efficiency, and cumulative effects of sluices, is proposed to detect the changes in the longitudinal connectivity in the flood and non-flood seasons. Based on this indicator, we took the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu region (WCXY) in China as a study region and detected the spatial impacts of the urbanization indices on the longitudinal connectivity by the geographically weighted regression. It is found that the average longitudinal connectivity in the non-flood season is 32% larger than that in the flood season in the WCXY region. The spatial distribution of the non-flood SLCI (values 0.6) is 26% larger than that of the flood SLCI. Spatially, the longitudinal connectivity is low (SLCI < 0.2) along the river and around the city where the sluices are distributed in. The longitudinal connectivity of the highly urbanized regions is lower than that of the lowly urbanized regions. Meanwhile, the relative effects of urbanization indices on the longitudinal connectivity can be sorted as follows: Landscape (69%) > Population (51%) > Economy (48%) in the nonflood season, and Population (88%) > Economy (63%) in the flood season.Show less"
11,"Wainwright, J",Mar 15 2011 ,"Linking environmental regimes, space and time: Interpretations of structural and functional connectivity",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Connectivity as a concept has been increasingly part of discussions or explanations in hydrology, geomorphology and ecology. We address recent critiques of this approach by demonstrating how a refinement which distinguishes structural connectivity from functional connectivity can be used to explain patterns observed in very different environmental systems. These systems are found in linkages between surface and subsurface flowpaths and the hyporheos in the River Don, a temperate river channel in Yorkshire. UK; in surface and subsurface fluxes in agricultural land in the UK; and in vegetation and surface conditions in a degrading environment at the Sevilleta LTER site in the semi-arid Southwest USA. First, we demonstrate long-term geological and structural controls mediated by in-channel processes. Second, human organization of landscape elements is a significant control on runoff and erosion, so that similar events can produce very different responses (and vice versa). Third, linkages between the removal of grass vegetation and runoff and erosion produce non-linear and path-dependent feedbacks which control the subsequent degradation of the landscape, making the process difficult to reverse. As a result of these studies, we argue that even in cases where connectivity cannot be directly quantified (at least at present), this limitation does not prevent the concept from being a useful heuristic device for exploring responses of complex systems. Furthermore, this result implies that an increasing need exists for disciplinary connectivity to investigate such systems. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"

13,"Erkinaro, J",Feb 2017 ,Road culvert restoration expands the habitat connectivity and production area of juvenile Atlantic salmon in a large subarctic river system,FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY,"The effects of restoration of impassable road culverts on the distribution of juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., were evaluated in seven small tributaries of the subarctic River Teno system, northernmost Finland/Norway. Restoration enabled the passage of juvenile salmon through the culverts and increased the distribution area of salmon parr in the seven streams by tens or hundreds of metres, depending on the natural slope of the tributary with a total of approximate to 1km new area for ascending juveniles. Areas upstream of the culverts were colonised after varying number of years, mostly 2-3, following restoration. Age-1 and age-2 parr were the first salmon age groups entering the new territory after removal of the migration barrier. Although the restoration measures were conducted at the downstream outlet area of the culverts only, the connectivity was improved and increased the production area accessible to juvenile salmon. Such removal of migration barriers and securing habitat connectivity by passable culverts should be taken into account in environmental management strategies of river systems safeguarding the essential habitats of salmonid fish.Show less"
14,"Li, MX",Feb 15 2021 ,Headwater stream ecosystem: an important source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere,WATER RESEARCH,"Although an increasing number of reports have revealed that rivers are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the magnitude and underlying mechanism of riverine GHG emissions are still poorly understood. The global extent of the headwater stream ecosystem may represent one of the important GHG emitters. A global database of GHG measurements from 595 rivers, indicated that the concentrations of riverine GHGs continually decrease as the stream order increases. Further analysis suggested that high GHG emissions from headwater streams (Strahler stream orders of 1 to 3) could be related to the low levels of dissolved oxygen, massive terrestrially derived carbon/nitrogen inputs and large gas exchange velocity. Through a combination of the predicted river surface areas and gas transfer velocities, we estimated that globally, the rivers emit approximately 6.6 (5.5-7.8) Pg CO2, 29.5 (19.6-37.3) Tg CH4, and 0.6 (0.2-0.9) Tg N2O per year, and totally emit 7.6 (6.1-9.1) CO2 equivalent into atmosphere per year. The headwater streams contribute 72.3%, 75.5%, and 77.2% of the global riverine CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, respectively. This study presents a systematic estimation of GHG emissions from river ecosystems worldwide and highlights the dominant role played by headwater streams in GHG evasions from global rivers.

15,"Van Meel, C",May 1 2019 ,The representation of symmetry in multi-voxel response patterns and functional connectivity throughout the ventral visual stream,NEUROIMAGE,"Several computational models explain how symmetry might be detected and represented in the human brain. However, while there is an abundance of psychophysical studies on symmetry detection and several neural studies showing where and when symmetry is detected in the brain, important questions remain about how this detection happens and how symmetric patterns are represented. We studied the representation of (vertical) symmetry in regions of the ventral visual stream, using multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) and functional connectivity analyses. Our results suggest that neural representations gradually change throughout the ventral visual stream, from very similar part-based representations for symmetrical and asymmetrical stimuli in V1 and V2, over increasingly different representations for symmetrical and asymmetrical stimuli which are nevertheless still part-based in both V3 and V4, to a more holistic representation for symmetrical compared to asymmetrical stimuli in high-level LOC. This change in representations is accompanied by increased communication between left and right retinotopic areas, evidenced by higher interhemispheric functional connectivity during symmetry perception in areas V2 and V4.Show less"
16,"Fratkin, MM",Aug 2020 ,The influence of lithology on channel geometry and bed sediment organization in mountainous hillslope-coupled streams,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Sediment transport and channel morphology in mountainous hillslope-coupled streams reflect a mixture of hillslope and channel processes. However, the influence of lithology on channel form and adjustment and sediment transport remains poorly understood. Patterns of channel form, grain size, and transport capacity were investigated in two gravel-bed streams with contrasting lithology (basalt and sandstone) in the Oregon Coast Range, USA, in a region in which widespread landslides and debris flows occurred in 1996. This information was used to evaluate threshold channel conditions and channel bed adjustment since 1996. Channel geometry, slope, and valley width were measured or extracted from LiDAR and sediment textures were measured in the surface and subsurface. Similar coarsening patterns in the first few kilometres of both streams indicated strong hillslope influences, but subsequent downstream fining was lithology-dependent. Despite these differences, surface grain size was strongly related to shear stress, such that the ratio of available to critical shear stress for motion of the median surface grain size at bankfull stage was around one over most of the surveyed lengths. This indicated hydraulic sorting of supplied sediment, independent of lithology. We infer a cycle of adjustment to sediment delivered during the 1996 flooding, from threshold conditions, to non-alluvial characteristics, to threshold conditions in both basins. The sandstone basin can also experience complete depletion of the gravel-size alluvium to sand size, leading to bedrock exposure because of high diminution rates. Although debris flows being more frequent in a basalt basin, this system will likely display threshold-like characteristics over a longer period, indicating that the lithologic control on channel adjustment is driven by differences in rock competence that control grain size and available gravel for bed load transport.

17,"Johaneman, TM",Jan 1 2020 ,Classifying connectivity to guide aquatic habitat management in an arctic coastal plain watershed experiencing land use and climate change,ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH,"Habitat connectivity supports life history requirements of many arctic fish species during periods of flowing water. However, aquatic habitat connectivity is susceptible to change due to climate factors and land use, particularly in the 4,600 km(2)Fish Creek Watershed (FCW) located in National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Varying degrees and mechanisms of connectivity between overwintering habitat and summer foraging habitat motivated us to assess and classify aquatic habitat connectivity to help inform management. Using geospatial analysis and field methods we classified processes affecting connectivity within riparian corridors and upstream channels. Results show the dominant geomorphic process affecting connectivity varied among river systems, providing general and catchment-specific guidance as to the distribution of important migratory fish habitat. Barriers to fish passage caused by subsurface flow were more common along river corridors with high channel migration rates, whereas wetland flowthrough was the most common barrier in upstream catchments throughout the FCW. Coupling both riparian and catchment connectivity showed that 28 percent of catchments were classified as having fish-passable connectivity, indicated by no barriers present in the riparian zone or upstream channels. Future work should evaluate how well this classification predicts fish habitat, is useful to resource management, and is applicable to other arctic watersheds.Show less"
18,"Xia, SX",Dec 15 2016 ,Wintering waterbirds in a large river floodplain: Hydrological connectivity is the key for reconciling development and conservation,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"An alteration in the hydrological connectivity reduces the synergistic processes and interactions between rivers and their floodplains, and changes the distribution of waterbirds that rely on floodplains as foraging grounds. Recent river and wetland conservation and restoration efforts have been partially focused on reinstating the natural river-floodplain connectivity to ameliorate the ecological effects of regulation in river systems. However, in regions where human well-being is tightly linked with the cultivation of the floodplain (such as fisheries), management options are constrained and trade-offs among competing social, economic and ecological goals may be necessary for the wise use of wetlands. Poyang Lake in east central China includes numerous sub-lakes with different types of hydrological regulation; therefore, this lake may provide a useful context for exploring the likelihood of such trade-offs. In this study, we used multiyear simultaneous waterbird survey data together with habitat maps derived from satellite imagery for Poyang Lake to examine-the variations in waterbird community structure and abundance within sub-lakes with different types of hydrological regulation. Using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, we built generalized linear mixed models to explore the differences in wetland composition and waterbird abundance/diversity among three lake types (i.e. isolated, freely connected, and controlled) at community, guild and species levels.. The results showed hydrological connectivity alteration clearly affects wintering waterbirds; in addition, the ecological benefits of a natural flow regime were most unambiguous at the community level. Nevertheless, little evidence exists to indicate that the lakes' ecological values as waterbird foraging grounds were compromised by partial regulation. That is, species richness and population size were comparable in naturally connected and controlled lakes. Our results suggest that, with carefully designed management plans, a delicate balance between waterbird conservation and development can be accomplished in large river floodplains.

We argue, however, that the material-discursive entanglement of streaming is a technological descendent of pre-electrical attempts to control essential resources through flow. Inspired by John Durham Peters's emphasis on elemental media, we examine streaming media practices that date to antiquity in order to assess infrastructures of flow today. By considering material technologies that capture and channel critical resources to be the ""original"" streaming media, we demonstrate how the idealized metaphor of streaming conceals the imbrication of human--technology--nature that underpins the capture and channel of flows. Consequently, we position streaming media as infrastructural, indebted to environments, and as part of a lineage that includes not only the telegraph, telephone, television, and film, but also rivers, canals, aqueducts, and pipelines.Show less"

It is unclear whether this fish lives in a very restricted area or may be dispersed over a long distance. In the present study spatial connectivity of populations of S. sichangensis was investigated based on 343 individuals collected from 12 sites of Chishui River and employing 22 microsatellite loci. The results of genetic diversity analysis showed that observed heterozygosity (H-O) and polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.5653 to 0.6999 and 0.8513 to 0.8819, respectively. Population structure analysis suggested that S. sichangensis had an unclear genetic structure. AMOVA showed that 69.36% of genetic variation was attributed to differentiation within individuals and all the pairwise genetic differentiation indices (F-ST) were low (mean F-ST = 0.0344), indicating weak differentiation among these populations. Estimation of gene flow showed frequent flow among populations, and contemporary levels (mean contemporary migration rate, m(c) = 0.0131) were approximately equal to historical levels (mean historical migration rate, m(h) = 0.0147). Individual relatedness analysis revealed a high level of sibship within and among different populations. The frequent gene flow and widespread sibship were due to S. sichangensis laying drifting eggs which travel for a long distance until hatching, after which the juveniles or adults migrate upstream. The results of unclear geographic structure and frequent exchange also indicate that it is necessary to decrease the negative impacts of anthropogenic activities on the connectivity of rivers to protect the migration routes of S. sichangensis.Show less"

This process and the final selection of key variables with relevant ecological meaning support the reliability and robustness of the final ANN model. The partial derivatives method was applied to determine the relative importance of input environmental variables. The final ANN model combined variables describing riparian quality, water quality, and physical habitat and helped identify the primary drivers of the NFSR patterns in Mediterranean rivers. In the second part of the study, the model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of two restoration actions in the)(war River: the removal of two abandoned weirs and the progressive increase in the proportion of riffles. The model indicated that the combination of these actions produced a rise in NFSR, which ultimately reached the maximum values observed in the reference site of that river ecotype (sensu the European Water Framework Directive). The results demonstrate the importance of longitudinal connectivity and riffle proportion for improving NFSR and the power of ANNs to help decisions in the management and ecological restoration of Mediterranean rivers. Furthermore, this model at the basin scale is the first step for further research on the effects of water scarcity and global change on Mediterranean fish communities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

23,"Derx, J",Nov 2010 ,Three-dimensional flow patterns at the river-aquifer interface - a case study at the Danube,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The three-dimensional groundwater flow patterns in a gravel bar at the Danube east of Vienna were investigated and are discussed in this paper. The observed groundwater level gradients are highly dynamic and respond very quickly to changes in the river water levels. A variably saturated groundwater model was calibrated to the data to describe the complex dynamics of flow in the gravel bar. The model results suggest that short-term (6-48 h) fluctuations of river water levels cause variations in the exchange flow rates from -351/s to 821/s. The highest rates occur during brief infiltration after rapidly rising river water levels. Simulations of different scenarios indicate that riverbank clogging will decrease the exchange fluxes by up to 80%, while clogging of both riverbank and riverbed essentially stops the flow exchange. The groundwater model is also used to simulate the transport of a conservative tracer. The variation of river water levels over time is shown to increase the extent of the active river-aquifer mixing zone in the gravel bar. These dynamic factors significantly enhance the dilution of conservative tracer concentrations in this zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Show less"
24,"Cook, BD",May 2011 ,Landscape genetic analysis of the tropical freshwater fish Mogurnda mogurnda (Eleotridae) in a monsoonal river basin: importance of hydrographic factors and population history,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"P>1. We performed spatial genetic analyses, incorporating landscape genetic methods using microsatellite data and phylogeographic analyses using mtDNA data, to identify the principal factors that determine population heterogeneity of the tropical freshwater fish, Mogurnda mogurnda, in the Daly River, northern Australia. We tested the individual and interactive effects of several environmental variables on spatial genetic patterns, including metrics relating to connectivity (i.e. stream distance, maximum stream gradient and elevation), habitat size (i.e. mean annual discharge) and a categorical variable relating to population history, as determined by mtDNA phylogeographic analyses. The Daly River is geomorphologically and hydrologically complex, and M. mogurnda has life history traits that limit its dispersal potential at river basin scales. Thus, we predicted that variables relating to connectivity would be the most important landscape factors driving population structure of the species.2. Tree-based phylogeographic analyses indicated four divergent mtDNA lineages within M. mogurnda in the Daly River, although three of the lineages were sympatric in various combinations and did not correspond with microsatellite groups identified by assignment tests. The allopatric mtDNA lineage detected in the uppermost part of the catchment was also identified as being highly differentiated by the microsatellite data, strongly suggesting that it may be a cryptic species. This site was therefore excluded from subsequent landscape genetic analyses.3. Analyses of Molecular Variance indicated that M. mogurnda has a hierarchical population structure in the Daly River, thus supporting theoretical expectations that hierarchically arranged river habitats in dendritic systems impose hierarchal population structures on lotic species.4. All landscape genetic analyses rejected stream distance, and supported stream gradient, as the major determinant of spatial genetic variation in M. mogurnda in the Daly River. Support for elevation as a determinant of spatial genetic patterns differed among the landscape genetic methods. Several of the landscape genetic methods also indicate that population history, including secondary contact between divergent and formerly allopatric genetic lineages, has a strong influence on spatial genetic patterns within M. mogurnda in the Daly River.5. This study demonstrates the need to consider multiple environmental factors, especially factors relating to connectivity, and their interactions in spatial genetic analysis, rather than just geographic distance. Importantly, it demonstrates the need to account for population history and evolutionary divergences in landscape genetic analyses.Show less"
25,"Heim, KC",Jan 2016 ,Seasonal cues of Arctic grayling movement in a small Arctic stream: the importance of surface water connectivity,ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,"In Arctic ecosystems, freshwater fish migrate seasonally between productive shallow water habitats that freeze in winter and deep overwinter refuge in rivers and lakes. How these movements relate to seasonal hydrology is not well understood. We used passive integrated transponder tags and stream wide antennae to track 1035 Arctic grayling in Crea Creek, a seasonally flowing beaded stream on the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska. Migration of juvenile and adult fish into Crea Creek peaked in June immediately after ice break-up in the stream. Fish that entered the stream during periods of high flow and cold stream temperature traveled farther upstream than those entering during periods of lower flow and warmer temperature. We used generalized linear models to relate migration of adult and juvenile fish out of Crea Creek to hydrology. Most adults migrated in late June - early July, and there was best support (Akaike weight = 0.46; w (i) ) for a model indicating that the rate of migration increased with decreasing discharge. Juvenile migration occurred in two peaks; the early peak consisted of larger juveniles and coincided with adult migration, while the later peak occurred shortly before freeze-up in September and included smaller juveniles. A model that included discharge, minimum stream temperature, year, season, and mean size of potential migrants was most strongly supported (w (i) = 0.86). Juvenile migration rate increased sharply as daily minimum stream temperature decreased, suggesting fish respond to impending freeze-up. We found fish movements to be intimately tied to the strong seasonality of discharge and temperature, and demonstrate the importance of small stream connectivity for migratory Arctic grayling during the entire open-water period. The ongoing and anticipated effects of climate change and petroleum development on Arctic hydrology (e.g. reduced stream connectivity, earlier peak flows, increased evapotranspiration) have important implications for Arctic freshwater ecosystems.Show less"
26,"Quenum, GMLD",Apr 2022 ,Potential of the Coupled WRF/WRF-Hydro Modeling System for Flood Forecasting in the Oueme River (West Africa),WATER,"Since the beginning of the 2000s, most of the West-African countries, particularly Benin, have experienced an increased frequency of extreme flood events. In this study, we focus on the case of the Oueme river basin in Benin. To investigate flood events in this basin for early warning, the coupled atmosphere-hydrology model system WRF-Hydro is used, and analyzed for the period 2008-2010. Such a coupled model allows exploration of the contribution of atmospheric components into the flood event, and its ability to simulate and predict accurate streamflow. The potential of WRF-Hydro to correctly simulate streamflow in the Oueme river basin is assessed by forcing the model with operational analysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Atmospheric and land surface processes are resolved at a spatial resolution of 5 km. The additional surface and subsurface water flow routing are computed at a resolution of 500 m. Key parameters of the hydrological module of WRF-Hydro are calibrated offline and tested online with the coupled WRF-Hydro. The uncertainty of atmospheric modeling on coupled results is assessed with the stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme (SKEBS). WRF-Hydro is able to simulate the discharge in the Oueme river in offline and fully coupled modes with a Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) around 0.70 and 0.76, respectively. In the fully coupled mode, the model captures the flood event that occurred in 2010. A stochastic perturbation ensemble of ten members for three rain seasons shows that the coupled model performance in terms of KGE ranges from 0.14 to 0.79. Additionally, an assessment of the soil moisture has been developed. This ability to realistically reproduce observed discharge in the Oueme river basin demonstrates the potential of the coupled WRF-Hydro modeling system for future flood forecasting applications.Show less"
27,"Townsend, SA",Sep 2011 ,Metabolism in a groundwater-fed river system in the Australian wet/dry tropics: tight coupling of photosynthesis and respiration,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The temporal pattern of river metabolism was estimated for high-order rivers (5-7(th)) in the Daly watershed, tropical Australia, during the dry season (May-October) when discharge was supplied predominantly by groundwater. Rates of photosynthesis (P) and respiration (R) were calculated at 4 sites using the open-channel method based on a model of the river's O-2 budget and Measured diurnal cycles of dissolved O-2 concentrations and temperatures. The rivers were shallow (average depth = 0.8 m), clear (1-2 NTU), and had low concentrations of nutrients (<= 15 mu g/L soluble N and P at most sites) and generally open canopy. At the reach scale, P was limited by light with no evidence of light saturation. An increase in primary producer biomass over the dry season probably underpinned an approximate doubling of P at the 4 sites over the dry season, but increased water temperatures would have contributed, too. P (0.1-4.6 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) in the Daly watershed was similar to rates in a shaded tropical Puerto Rican stream and some temperate rivers but was lower than in nutrient-enriched temperate rivers. We surmise that most P resulted in production of dissolved organic C (DOC), rather than growth of primary producer biomass, which was nutrient limited. R exceeded P (P/R approximate to 0.5), and increased approximately linearly with P (r(2) = 0.79-0.99) over the dry season with no statistically significant difference among sites. The similar environmental setting of the 4 sites underpinned their similar temporal pattern of metabolism. Bacterial metabolism of photosynthetically produced DOC (PDOC) could partially explain the tight coupling of R and P but could not account for the river's overall net heterotrophy. The priming effect of bacterial degradation of labile PDOC to increase the mineralization of recalcitrant DOC (e.g., humic acids) provides an explanation for the river's heterotrophy and tight coupling between P and R.Show less"

Critical wildlife habitat on the main stem requires additional in-stream flows. The watershed is one hosting multiple resources, a variety of users, and managed by an array of state and federal agencies. This study proposes a basis for securing in-stream flows for the Platte River. Candidate water supply mechanisms are suggested based on the way in which Casper, Wyoming secured water for its municipal needs. Canal lining is compared to a dam project, increasing reservoir storage, and purchasing water rights, with consideration also made for water pricing to reduce municipal use. Comparisons are based on economic efficiency, potential water conservation, and property rights criteria. Canal lining, coupled with demand management, is shown to conserve water best, given the set of efficiency and cost criteria for in-stream flow enhancement. The approach offers an opportunity to organize the water supply choice context in a transboundary watershed when quantitative information is limited.Show less"
29,"Costigan, KH",Jan 2016 ,Rapid Response of a Sand-Dominated River to Installation and Removal of a Temporary Run-of-the-River Dam,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Run-of-the-river dams (RORDs) comprise the vast majority of dams on river systems and are commonly removed as a part of stream restoration strategies. Although these dams are routinely removed, few studies have documented the geomorphological responses of sand-bed rivers to the removal of RORDs. We examined the response of a large sand-bed river located in South-Central Kansas, USA, to the installation and removal of a dam that is installed annually for seasonal recreational purposes. Channel adjustments were tracked using cross-sections sampled over the course of 7months as the dam was installed and subsequently removed. Multivariate spatiotemporal analysis revealed emergence of channel stability when the dam was in place for most cross-sections, except for those immediately adjacent to or at great distances from the dam. Our results provide an approximation for how sand-bed rivers respond to RORD construction and removal and are useful for guiding management decisions involving preservation or restoration of connectivity. Results of this study suggest that sand-bed rivers are resilient and recover quickly when transient RORDs are removed. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
30,"Martini, L",May 2022 ,Predicting sediment connectivity in a mountain basin: A quantitative analysis of the index of connectivity,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Sediment connectivity underlies the relationships between sediment source areas and stream network and the use of topography-based indices, such as the index of connectivity (IC), has become a common approach to investigate these relationships. However, few studies have tested the potential of the IC as an independent variable for predicting observable processes. In this study, the aim is the validation of the IC as a semi-quantitative tool for depicting structural connectivity and predicting sediment dynamics linking sediment sources to the channel network after a large infrequent disturbance in the Rio Cordon catchment (Italy). First, the assessment of lateral connectivity was carried out using a combination of remote sensing data and field observations. In this way, it was possible to classify the sediment sources into disconnected, connected or functionally connected. Second, logistic regression analyses were performed using different IC variants, with different weighting factors and spatial resolutions as independent variables and connectivity status as dependent variable. Hence, the predictive capacity of the IC was tested and a threshold was derived to distinguish between low and high sediment connectivity. The results showed that only 15% of sediment sources are connected to the stream network. Moreover, the IC proved to be a reliable tool for depicting structural connectivity when using surface roughness as weighting factor and high-resolution digital terrain models. On the contrary, it failed at predicting sediment dynamics as it did not classify correctly the functionally connected areas, so it cannot infer functional sediment connectivity in this case study. As a consequence, it was possible to obtain an IC threshold of -2.32, capable of differentiating between low and high structural sediment connectivity and useful for future management decisions. The threshold, in fact, represents an objective boundary between disconnected and connected sources in the Rio Cordon catchment.Show less"
31,"Zhao, TTG",Mar 3 2017 ,Deriving Flood-Mediated Connectivity between River Channels and Floodplains: Data-Driven Approaches,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"The flood-mediated connectivity between river channels and floodplains plays a fundamental role in flood hazard mapping and exerts profound ecological effects. The classic nearest neighbor search (NNS) fails to derive this connectivity because of spatial heterogeneity and continuity. We develop two novel data-driven connectivity-deriving approaches, namely, progressive nearest neighbor search (PNNS) and progressive iterative nearest neighbor search (PiNNS). These approaches are illustrated through a case study in Northern Australia. First, PNNS and PiNNS are employed to identify flood pathways on floodplains through forward tracking. That is, progressive search is performed to associate newly inundated cells in each time step to previously inundated cells. In particular, iterations in PiNNS ensure that the connectivity is continuous -the connection between any two cells along the pathway is built through intermediate inundated cells. Second, inundated floodplain cells are collectively connected to river channel cells through backward tracing. Certain river channel sections are identified to connect to a large number of inundated floodplain cells. That is, the floodwater from these sections causes widespread floodplain inundation. Our proposed approaches take advantage of spatial-temporal data. They can be applied to achieve connectivity from hydro-dynamic and remote sensing data and assist in river basin planning and management.Show less"
32,"Anderson, EP",Jun 2008 ,"Quantifying the extent of river fragmentation by hydropower dams in the Sarapiqui River Basin, Costa Rica",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,"1. Costa Rica has recently experienced a rapid proliferation of dams for hydropower on rivers draining its northern Caribbean slope. In the Sarapiqui River Basin, eight hydropower plants were built between 1990 and 1999 and more projects are either under construction or proposed. The majority of these dams are small (< 15 m tall) and operate as water diversion projects.2. While the potential environmental effects of individual projects are evaluated prior to dam construction, there is a need for consideration of the basin-scale ecological consequences of hydropower development. This study was a first attempt to quantify the extent of river fragmentation by dams in the Sarapiqui River Basin.3. Using simple spatial analyses, the length of river upstream from dams and the length of de-watered reaches downstream from dams was measured. Results indicated that there are currently 306.8 km of river (9.4% of the network) upstream from eight existing dams in the Sarapiqui River Basin and 30.6 km of rivers (0.9% of the network) with significantly reduced flow downstream from dams. Rivers upstream from dams primarily drain two life zones: Premontane Rain Forest (107.9km) and Lower Montane Rain Forest (168.2km).4. Simple spatial analyses can be used as a predictive or planning tool for considering the effects of future dams in a basin-scale context. In the Sarapiqui River Basin, we recommend that future dam projects be constructed on already dammed rivers to minimize additional river fragmentation and to protect remaining riverine connectivity.

There are many hypotheses about the potential environmental drivers of variation in cyanobacterial abundance and toxicity, but these hypotheses have rarely been considered in combination and rarely been examined in large river ecosystems. Here, we use monthly data from backwater habitats of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) to evaluate associations between environmental conditions and cyanobacterial abundance and toxicity (microcystin and anatoxin-a) that would be expected based on several hypotheses. Backwaters in the Mississippi River vary in flushing rate, temperature, turbidity, nutrient availability, water depth, and vegetative cover. We find support for hypotheses that suggest physical conditions in backwaters (flushing rate, temperature, turbidity, rooted vegetation cover, and water depth) and nutrient availability influence cyanobacterial abundance and toxicity. We then used structural equation modeling to incorporate several hypotheses into a causal modeling framework, which indicated that backwater connectivity (flushing) strongly influences cyanobacterial abundance via the regulation of water temperature, and that nutrient availability strongly influences the presence of microcystin concentrations above our detection limit. Our data suggest that management of backwater connectivity could influence cyanobacterial abundance and toxicity in UMR backwaters. Reconnecting backwaters (via alteration of levees) could serve as a local adaptation to minimize the effects of climate change and excessive nutrient loading.Show less"
35,"Jones, CN",Nov 17 2015 ,Seasonal Variation in Floodplain Biogeochemical Processing in a Restored Headwater Stream,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Stream and river restoration activities have recently begun to emphasize the enhancement of biogeochemical processing within river networks through the restoration of river-floodplain connectivity. It is generally accepted that this practice removes pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus because the increased contact time of nutrient-rich floodwaters with reactive floodplain sediments. Our study examines this assumption in the floodplain of a recently restored, low-order stream through five seasonal experiments. During each experiment, a floodplain slough was artificially inundated for 3 h. Both the net flux of dissolved nutrients and nitrogen uptake rate were measured during each experiment. The slough was typically a source of dissolved phosphorus and dissolved organic matter, a sink of NO3-, and variable source/sink of ammonium. NO3- uptake rates were relatively high when compared to riverine uptake, especially during the spring and summer experiments. However, when scaled up to the entire 1 km restoration reach with a simple inundation model, less than 0.5-1.5% of the annual NO3- load would be removed because of the short duration of river-floodplain connectivity. These results suggest that restoring river-floodplain connectivity is not necessarily an appropriate best management practice for nutrient removal in low-order streams with legacy soil nutrients from past agricultural landuse.Show less"
36,"Parshakova, Y",Dec 2022 ,Dynamics of Pollution in the Hyporheic Zone during Industrial Processing Brine Discharge,WATER,"The industrial production of chemicals, including the manufacture of mineral fertilizers, is often associated with the need for the disposal of highly mineralized brines through their discharge into surface water bodies or an underground water-bearing layer. When dealing with surface water bodies, the problem of the hyporheic zone effect could substantially influence the process and, thus, must be examined. We consider a two-layer system (liquid-porous medium) for a detailed assessment of the importance of considering the hyporheic zone during the modeling of brine discharge. A three-dimensional numerical simulation of brine transport is performed for parameters close to the characteristics of the media and flows typical for natural water bodies. The dynamics of a saturated brine in a two-layer system are studied for the period of brine discharging and after the cessation of the disposal, and the accumulation of salts in the bottom porous layer is assessed. Calculations show that a significant amount of impurities is observed not only near the water body bottom but also throughout the entire thickness of the porous layer. Moreover, the obtained data reveal that the effect of vertical stratification dramatically influences the brine discharge process and leads to propagation of the brine into the porous medium with a velocity that is three orders of magnitude higher than the filtration rate in the horizontal direction. As a result, the heterogeneity in the depth distribution of the impurity concentration is significant. In particular, the maximum concentration of salt in the hyporheic zone exceeds those near the river surface by hundreds of times. Impurities accumulated in the water-bearing layer of the river bottom are nonhazardous at low- and medium-flow rates. However, with an increase in the river flow intensity-for example, during the flood period or caused by operating regime of a hydroelectric power plant-the accumulated contamination may become an intensive source of pollution, which significantly limits the water use regime.Show less"
37,"Voicu, R",Mar 2020 ,"A potential engineering solution to facilitate upstream movement of fish in mountain rivers with weirs: Southern Carpathians, the Azuga River",JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE,"An important aspect in the restoration of longitudinal connectivity in rivers and streams is the implementation of fish migration systems at the upstream of the functional hydraulic structures (weirs, drop structures or river sills). The diversity of these existing structures as well as the different locations of these weirs within the river, watershed and riparian zone challenge the design engineers to find new holistic solutions for fish migration systems. The Azuga River study area requires a new synergistic fish migration design system. Being a mountain area, rapid increase in water level is quite frequent, especially after heavy or prolonged rainfalls and during spring snow melt. Therefore, it is necessary to design a specific system for fish migration to meet this locations requirements. Due to the characteristics in this location of the Azuga river, the classic fish migration systems would not be functional. The indigenous/mountain trout is considered as the target species in this paper. Although this is a good swimming species, the use of classical systems could, due to exhaustion, prevent and/or reduce the movement of fish upstream of the two weirs (also known as river sills). This new, comprehensive solution, presented in this paper includes: (i) the restoration and stabilization works of the right bank in the weir study area by using biotechnical measures and (ii) the upstream migration system itself - for supporting the migration of fish on the Azuga River.Show less"

Knowledge of mass transfer processes at the sediment-water interface (SWI) remains scarce. Accurate predictive modeling of flow driving pollutant fluxes at the SWI is currently limited. We examined mass exchange at the SWI by combining laboratory tracer experiments and the development of a flow reactive transport (FRT) model. NaCl and Foron Blue 291 tracers were used as surrogates of conservative and moderately sorptive organic pollutants, respectively. Tracer experiments in the bench-scale river channel reproduced the influence of overlying water velocities, the source of the pollutant, and its sorption capacity on pollutant exchange. A methodological framework to calibrate the FRT model against experiments was developed. Good agreement between the experimental and numerical results confirmed the robustness of the experimental setup and numerical model. The pollutant origin, either from the sediment or the overlying water, did not affect the pollutant exchange rates. The exchange rates were quasi-proportional to the overlying water velocity. The sediment bed caused retention of more than half of the initially injected mass of Foron Blue 291. The moderately sorptive tracer partitioning retarded the equilibrium up to six times compared with the conservative tracer NaCl. Numerical tests, including both overlying and vertical velocities, showed that the latter is the main factor controlling pollutant exchange at the SWI. Altogether, the model allows capturing interactions between pollutant transport and partitioning to the rivers sediment, paving the way for systematic investigations of pollutant behavior in rivers.Show less"

The heavy metals profile was observed in the order of Sediments > Fish > Water and Ikom Station I > Obubra Station II > Ekori Station III > Ikot Okpora Station IV > Ikot Offiong Station V > Calabar Station VI respectively.

This implies that the waste assimilation capacity of the river is high, a phenomenon that could be ascribed to dilution, sedimentation and continuous water exchange. This is an indication that an urban and industrial waste discharged into the Cross River has a significant effect on the ecological balance of the river.

41,"Fytilis, N",Nov 2013 ,Coupling self-organizing maps with a Naive Bayesian classifier : Stream classification studies using multiple assessment data,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Organizing or clustering data into natural groups is one of the most fundamental aspects of understanding and mining information. The recent explosion in sensor networks and data storage associated with hydrological monitoring has created a huge potential for automating data analysis and classification of large, high-dimensional data sets. In this work, we develop a new classification tool that couples a Naive Bayesian classifier with a neural network clustering algorithm (i.e., Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM)). The combined Bayesian-SOM algorithm reduces classification error by leveraging the Bayesian's ability to accommodate parameter uncertainty with the SOM's ability to reduce high-dimensional data to lower dimensions. The resulting algorithm is data-driven, nonparametric and is as computationally efficient as a Naive Bayesian classifier due to its parallel architecture. We apply, evaluate and test the Bayesian-SOM network using two real-world hydrological data sets. The first uses genetic data to classify the state of disease in native fish populations in the upper Madison River, MT, USA. The second uses stream geomorphic and water quality data measured at similar to 2500 Vermont stream reaches to predict habitat conditions. The new classification tool has substantial benefits over traditional classification methods due to its ability to dynamically update prior information, assess the uncertainty/confidence of the posterior probability values, and visualize both the input data and resulting probabilistic clusters onto two-dimensional maps to better assess nonlinear mappings between the two.Show less"

While the socioecological impacts of river infrastructure projects (RIPs) have been well-documented, methodological approaches to quantify river fragmentation and flow alteration vary widely in spatiotemporal scope, required data, and interpretation. In this review, we first present a framework to visualise the effects of different kinds of RIPs on river fragmentation and flow alteration. We then review available methods to quantify connectivity and flow alteration, along with their data requirements, scale of application, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, we present decision-making trees to help stakeholders select among these methods based on their objectives, resource availability, and the characteristics of the project(s) being evaluated. Thematic searches of peer-reviewed literature using topic-relevant keywords were conducted on Google Scholar. The bibliography of selected papers was also reviewed, resulting in the selection of 79 publications. Papers that did not define or apply a specific metric were excluded. With respect to fragmentation, we selected papers focused on instream connectivity and excluded those dealing with overland hydrologic connections. For flow alteration, we selected papers that quantified the extent of alteration and excluded those aimed at prescribing environmental flows. The expected hydrological consequences of various RIP types were 'mapped' on a conceptual fragmentation-flow alteration plot. We compiled 29 metrics of river fragmentation and 13 metrics to flow alteration, and used these to develop decision-making trees to facilitate method selection. Despite recent advances in metric development, further work is needed to better understand the relationships between and among metrics, assess their ecological significance and spatiotemporal scale of application, and develop more informative methods that can be effectively applied in data-scarce regions. These objectives are especially critical given the growing use of such metrics in basin-wide conservation and development planning.Show less"

To investigate impacts from river damming and instream flow regulation on these processes, we studied the lower Red Deer River in the semi-arid region of Alberta, Canada. Dickson Dam was implemented in 1983 and although major flood peaks in June 2005 and June 2013 were attenuated by about one-quarter, substantial seedling establishment of plains cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) was observed. Cross-sectional transects in 2014 and 2015 revealed the reproductively mature cottonwood band from 2005, while the 2013 colonization was limited to low elevations of 0.3-1.3 m above the base river stage. Seedling numbers and the elevational ranges were probably reduced by abrupt (>4 cm/day) river stage reductions in July 2005 and in July 2013. In addition to direct seedling establishment on barren sandbars, we observed ""coupled colonization"" with cottonwood recruitment within sparse patches of sandbar willows (Salix exigua). The flood-tolerant willows stabilize the bars and increase aggradation through sediment trapping. Thus, cottonwood colonization persisted after damming, indicating that the pattern of downstream flow regulation was important, rather than damming per se. To sustain riparian recruitment along regulated rivers in dry regions, we recommend: (1) that floods be allowed as feasible, (2) higher river stages during seed dispersal, (3) flow ramping (gradual summer recession) for seedling survival, (4) sufficient growing season flows to avoid drought-induced mortality, and (5) that willows be encouraged as well as cottonwoods.Show less"

The case of Plecoptera (10 potamal species either altogether extinct, extinct in Central Europe or extremely endangered) suggests that potamal invertebrates suffered as severe losses as did fish.Human impact on major rivers was so severe also because they occur at distances beyond average dispersal capacity of the fauna, i.e. are widely separate ecological islands, with known risk of species losses. In contrast, faunal exchange between adjacent headwater streams in mountains with intact stream nets is easy, certainly for amphibious insects. However, damage to rhithral streams is becoming increasingly frequent. This fragments stream nets, turning also upper parts of drainage systems into ecological islands, with danger of extinctions. Rhithral biodiversity is thought to be much more endangered by human impact than is presently recognized.Show less"
46,"Ma, Q",Feb 2022 ,Extensive cortical functional connectivity of the human hippocampal memory system,CORTEX,"The cortical connections of the human hippocampal memory system are fundamental to understanding its operation in health and disease, especially in the context of the great development of the human cortex. The functional connectivity of the human hippocampal system was analyzed in 172 participants imaged at 7T in the Human Connectome Project. The human hippocampus has high functional connectivity not only with the entorhinal cortex, but also with areas that are more distant in the ventral 'what' stream including the perirhinal cortex and temporal cortical visual areas. Parahippocampal gyrus TF in humans has connectivity with this ventral 'what' subsystem. Correspondingly for the dorsal stream, the hippocampus has high functional connectivity not only with the presubiculum, but also with areas more distant, the medial parahippocampal cortex TH which includes the parahippocampal place or scene area, the posterior cingulate including retrosplenial cortex, and the parietal cortex. Further, there is considerable cross connectivity between the ventral and dorsal streams with the hippocampus. The findings are supported by anatomical connections, which together provide an unprecedented and quantitative overview of the extensive cortical connectivity of the human hippocampal system that goes beyond hierarchically organised and segregated pathways connecting the hippocampus and neocortex, and leads to new concepts on the operation of the hippocampal memory system in humans.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

47,"Semiromi, MT",Mar 2019 ,"Analysis of spatio-temporal variability of surface-groundwater interactions in the Gharehsoo river basin, Iran, using a coupled SWAT-MODFLOW model",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Although groundwater and surface water are often treated as individual water compartments in hydrological cycle studies, they essentially originate from one source. Such a split approach restricts the optimal usages of these water resources in several water management applications. The present study aims to shed light on the complex interaction of surface-groundwater interactions in terms of groundwater recharge from drainage network towards the adjacent aquafer and conversely, groundwater discharge from the aquifer towards the drainage network in the Gharehsoo River Basin (GRB), with the enclosed Ardabil aquifer, located in northwest Iran. To that end, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), as the surface hydrological model was fully coupled with the latest version of the Modular Three-Dimensional Finite-Difference Groundwater Flow (MODFLOW-NWT) (Newton-Raphson Technique to improve the solutions of unconfined groundwater-flow problems). The total study period, i.e. 1978-2012 was split into two intervals for calibration (1988-2012) and validation (1978-1987). To facilitate and expedite the calibration of the coupled model, first we calibrated SWAT and MODFLOW-NWT independently against the observed streamflow and groundwater head time series, respectively. Afterwards, we recalibrated the coupled model SWAT-MODFLOW. To link these two models, the surface and sub-surface water flow components are exchanged between the Disaggregated Hydrological Response Units (DHRUs) of SWAT with the MODFLOW-NWT' grid cells. In addition, three more flow components are sequentially exchanged: the deep percolation from SWAT to MODFLOW-NWT, baseflow/groundwater discharge from MODFLOW-NWT to SWAT, and the river heads from SWAT to MODFLOW-NWT. The results of the application show that the coupled model satisfactorily, quantified by R(2)0.5, simulates streamflow and particularly, groundwater heads. In fact, both observations and simulations indicate that, owing to an ongoing overexploitation of the aquifer, heads havebeen decreased steadily over the studied period which has led to a parallel decline of the groundwater storage. Moreover, the analysis of the stream-aquifer exchange flows indicates that groundwater discharge towards the stream-network (effluent conditions) is orders of magnitude higher than the opposite process (influent conditions). In addition, findings reveal that many of the tributaries across the GRB have shifted from a perennial regime to ephemeral/intermittent system over the past decades. The provided and well-tested coupled model would be a viable asset to assess a wide range of plausible scenarios to identify most effective and practical water resource management schemes to recover the severely depleted surface water and groundwater resources of the GRB.Show less"
48,"Morel-Seytoux, HJ",Sep-oct 2014 ,Factors Influencing the Stream-Aquifer Flow Exchange Coefficient,GROUNDWATER,"Knowledge of river gain from or loss to a hydraulically connected water table aquifer is crucial in issues of water rights and also when attempting to optimize conjunctive use of surface and ground waters. Typically in groundwater models this exchange flow is related to a difference in head between the river and some point in the aquifer, through a ""coefficient."" This coefficient has been defined differently as well as the location for the head in the aquifer. This paper proposes a new coefficient, analytically derived, and a specific location for the point where the aquifer head is used in the difference. The dimensionless part of the coefficient is referred to as the SAFE (stream-aquifer flow exchange) dimensionless conductance. The paper investigates the factors that influence the value of this new conductance. Among these factors are (1) the wetted perimeter of the cross-section, (2) the degree of penetration of the cross-section, and (3) the shape of the cross-section. The study shows that these factors just listed are indeed ordered in their respective level of importance. In addition the study verifies that the analytical correct value of the coefficient is matched by finite difference simulation only if the grid system is sufficiently fine. Thus the use of the analytical value of the coefficient is an accurate and efficient alternative to ad hoc estimates for the coefficient typically used in finite difference and finite element methods.Show less"
49,"Davis, WN",Dec 2010 ,Effects of coalbed natural gas development on fish assemblages in tributary streams of the Powder and Tongue rivers,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Extraction of coalbed natural gas (CBNG) often results in disposal of large quantities of CBNG product water, which may affect aquatic ecosystems. We evaluated the effects of CBNG development on fish assemblages in tributary streams of the Powder and Tongue rivers. We used treatment and control, impact versus reference sites comparisons, surveys of CBNG product-water streams and in situ fish survival approaches to determine if CBNG development affected fish assemblages.2. Several of our results suggested that CBNG development did not affect fish assemblages. Species richness and index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores were similar in streams with and streams without CBNG development, and overall biotic integrity was not related to the number or density of CBNG wells. Fish occurred in one stream that was composed largely or entirely of CBNG product water. Sentinel fish survived in cages at treatment sites where no or few fish were captured, suggesting that factors such as lack of stream connectivity rather than water quality limited fish abundance at these sites. Fish species richness did not differ significantly from 1994 to 2006 in comparisons of CBNG-developed and undeveloped streams. Biotic integrity declined from 1994 to 2006; however, declines occurred at both impact and reference sites, possibly because of long-term drought.3. Some evidence suggested that CBNG development negatively affected fish assemblages, or may do so over time. Specific conductivity was on average higher in treatment streams and was negatively related to biotic integrity. Four IBI species richness metrics were negatively correlated with the number or density of CBNG wells in the catchment above sampling sites. Bicarbonate, one of the primary ions in product water, was significantly higher in developed streams and may have limited abundance of longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae). Total dissolved solids, alkalinity, magnesium and sulphate were significantly higher in developed streams.4. Biological monitoring conducted before the development of CBNG, and continuing through the life of development and reclamation, together with data on the quantity, quality and fate of CBNG product water will allow robust assessment of potential effects of future CBNG development worldwide.Show less"
