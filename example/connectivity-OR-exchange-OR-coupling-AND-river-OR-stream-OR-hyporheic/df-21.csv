The use of morphological traits can be useful to detect organisms distribution patterns in these areas. Information concerning hyporheic communities are scarce as well on chironomid vertical distribution. Fauna samples from the hyporheic zone were collected at three depths and in four microhabitats. Eighteen genera were recorded and 13 morphological traits were identified. The results indicate that the distribution patterns of hyporheic chironomid taxa vary according to depth and microhabitat. Spatial preferences for riffles habitats are evident, and the vertical distribution is correlated with morphological traits like body size, pseudopods and mentum. Faunal abundance and richness decreased with depth and the vertical distribution influenced the chironomid morphological traits. We conclude that the use of morphological trait can introduce new useful information about the distribution of hyporheic fauna.Show less"
1,"Phelps, QE",Jan 2015 ,Temporary connectivity: the relative benefits of large river floodplain inundation in the lower Mississippi River,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,"Studies have demonstrated the importance of the synergistic relationship between large rivers and adjacent floodplain connectivity. The majority of large rivers and their associated floodplain have been isolated through a series of expansive levee systems. Thus, evaluations of the relative importance of floodplain connectivity are limited due to the aforementioned anthropogenic perturbations. However, persistent elevated river levels during spring 2011 at the confluence of the Mississippi River and Ohio River prompted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create large gaps in the levee system producing an expansive floodplain (i.e. the New Madrid Floodway). Specifically, the New Madrid Floodway (approximately 475 km(2)) in southeast Missouri was created to divert part of the Mississippi River flow during catastrophic floods and thus alleviate flood risk on nearby population centers. Given the historic flooding of 2011, the floodway was opened and provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the influence of floodplain inundation on fish species diversity, relative abundance, and growth. We sampled the floodplain and the adjacent river at three stratified random locations with replication biweekly from the commencement of inundation (late May) through early October. Overall, we found that species diversity, relative abundance, and growth were higher in the floodplain than the main river. Our data support previous examinations, including those outside North America, that suggest floodplain inundation may be important for riverine fishes. Given these apparent advantages of floodplain inundation, restoration efforts should balance benefits of floodplain inundation while safeguarding priority needs of humans.Show less"
2,"Jin, GQ",Jan 2021 ,The effect of density-driven flow on the transport of high-concentration solutes in the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In this study, both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of density-driven flow on the transport of high-concentration pollutants in the hyporheic zone. The results show that the density gradient can change the flow of pore water and the strong density-driven flow can lead to an unstable flow, which increases the effect of preferential flow and thus causes the appearance of solute fingers in the hyporheic zone. Notably, these solute fingers become more obvious with the increase of depth. The appearance of solute fingers depends on the relative strength of the pumping exchange and density gradient, which are represented by the dimensionless number M* and N* respectively. Finger flows appear near the interface when M* is less than 0.5 N*. This study may contribute to better understanding the transport and destination of solutes and thus may provide some insights into the assessment on pollution incidents.Show less"
3,"Kim, C",Jan 1 2018 ,Semi-continuous capacitive deionization using multi-channel flow stream and ion exchange membranes,DESALINATION,"Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a promising desalination process, but conventional static electrode CDI operates by sequentially cycling through charging and discharging to produce fresh and concentrated water, respectively. However, an effective continuous operation is desirable for optimized system operation. Here, we report a semi continuous desalination process with a novel modified CDI cell architecture using a multi-channel flow stream and ion exchange membranes (MC-MCDI). This MC-MCDI consists of two channels including side and middle channels with a pair of cation and anion ion exchange membranes where the feed streams can be separately distributed without mixing. The MC-MCDI design allows semi-continuous production of clean water since the separated middle and side channels are alternately desalinated and regenerated: one channel is being desalinated while the other channel is regenerated. Therefore, the cell can produce clean water during both charging and discharging, enabling semi-continuous operation. In addition, with the benefit from similar cell configuration with membrane CDI, the MC-MCDI design exhibits a high salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of 22 +/- 2 mg/g and charge efficiency of 90 +/- 2% at middle and side channels during charging and discharging with reverse voltage operation (cell voltage of + 1.2 V vs.- 1.2 V).Show less"
4,"Marchi, L",Jun 10 2019 ,Channel control works and sediment connectivity in the European Alps,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The need for reducing erosion and sediment transport. and protecting human settlements has urged the construction of channel control works in mountain streams. Such works include different structures, the check dams being probably the most widespread and archetypical. The performance of channel control works in mountain streams has usually been evaluated based on their effectiveness in stabilizing the channels and the adjacent hillslopes, and in retaining sediment. The widespread presence of channel control works in mountain streams of various regions, however, has also a significant impact on hillslope-channel coupling and on sediment transfer across the channel system. Taking into account the impact of channel control works on sediment connectivity at the catchment scale has remarkable importance for planning new control structures and managing the existing ones and, more in general, for sediment management in mountain catchments. In this paper, we consider the channel control works within the conceptual framework of sediment connectivity and related terminology, and we analyze the spatial and temporal scales of the interactions between channel control works and sediment coupling-decoupling. Some examples from the Italian Alps outline the impact of check dams and other hydraulic structures on sediment connectivity and show the potential of geomorphometry in assessing such impacts. The overall effect of control works on sediment connectivity consists of an alteration of the sediment cascade with a decrease in the efficiency of sediment transfer. Sediment is partly retained behind grade-control dams within the catchment or in sediment traps equipped with retention check dams near the alluvial fan apex. These works contribute to decouple the alluvial fans from the upslope catchment. On the contrary, channel bed lining on alluvial fans favors sediment transfer to the receiving river, but this effect usually involves small amounts of sediment not retained by the check dams built upstream.

6,"Xiao, HB",Jul 2022 ,Physical structure and rainfall controls on subsurface hydrological connectivity in hillslope-riparian-stream continuums,CATENA,"The hydrological connectivity of hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) continuums is crucial for runoff generation and solute transport. The achievement of water resource protection and water quality improvement requires a systematic understanding of the structure and rainfall controls on HRS connectivity. Herein, two HRS continuums with different soil depths and slopes (HRS-1: thin soil depth and steep slope; HRS-2: thick soil depth and gentle slope) were established. We monitored the soil moisture from the surface to the soil-bedrock interface at 15 min intervals from March to June 2021. The HRS connectivity was analyzed based on soil saturation conditions, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to reveal the relationships between rainfall and HRS connectivity. The results showed that the time required to establish hydrological connectivity in HRS-1 was shorter than that in HRS-2, which indicated that the contribution to runoff of the HRS continuum with a thin soil depth and steep slope was dominant during the early stage of rainstorm. As rainfall intensity increased, the required time was shortened exponentially due to the changes in hydrological connectivity patterns. In addition, the higher connectivity strength (i.e., the magnitude of HRS connectivity) was observed in the HRS-2 than that in the HRS-1 during heavy rainfall events. The PLSR analysis showed that rainfall amount, 30 min maximum rainfall intensity, 15 min maximum rainfall intensity, and rainfall duration were important controls affecting connectivity strength. Rainfall amount and peak rainfall intensity exerted more important effects than did antecedent soil moisture on the connectivity strength. Furthermore, there was a clear rainfall threshold for HRS connectivity, from 14.8 mm in HRS-1 to 21.1 mm in HRS-2. The increased soil depth and reduced slope enhanced the rainfall threshold of HRS connectivity. Our results indicate that the physical structure of the HRS continuum exerts a primary control on the rainfall threshold.Show less"
7,"Clyne, JB",Feb 2022 ,Groundwater-stream connectivity from minutes to months across United States basins as revealed by spectral analysis,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream corridors are dynamic places where streams and aquifers are connected and interact to various degrees, depending on geology, climate, stream morphology, and water use. Water table fluctuations propagate through the unconfined aquifer and are linked with changes in solute export to streams and biogeochemical transformations in floodplain soils. Through publicly available USGS data, this study aims to better understand the behaviour of stream-groundwater connectivity and water table fluctuations by analysing continuous time series of water levels from 17 pairs of stream gauges and nearby (<100 m) groundwater monitoring wells. Sites are located within 8 of 18 major hydrologic units (HUC-2) across the contiguous United States and span a variety of stream sizes, climates, and land use practises. More than 50% of sites have a water table that remains within 3 m of the land surface year-round. Energy spectral densities and cross-wavelet transformations generally reveal strong coherence between the water table and stream stage over daily to monthly periods. The transfer function, which describes relative variations between the water table and stream stage, shows that 10 of 17 sites are more stream-dominated at daily and monthly frequencies, meaning that water level fluctuations are greater in the stream and propagate into the aquifer. Only 1 of 17 sites is more groundwater-dominated at daily and monthly frequencies, meaning that water level fluctuations are greater in the aquifer. This study shows the utility of frequency-domain analysis for revealing specific timescales of stream-aquifer interaction.Show less"
8,"Van Looy, K",Feb 10 2014 ,Integrated modelling of functional and structural connectivity of river corridors for European otter recovery,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Connectivity may be structural, based on adjacency of landscape features, or functional, based on how that adjacency translates to movement of organisms. We present a modelling approach that elucidates both aspects of connectivity to identify vital corridors and conservation priorities in a river network. For the dendritic network structure of river systems, at first a graph theoretic structure is developed to model the river network at the segment scale. To derive functional connectivity, a Bayesian hierarchical modelling of species dispersal is applied to infer the influence of riparian corridor characteristics to the species colonization.The integration of the functional and structural component is realized with a graph-theoretic connectivity measure. With this approach, the European otter colonization of the Loire river basin over 25 years is modelled on the basis of large datasets on riparian corridor land use and hydromorphological characteristics of a 17,000 km river network. Channel straightening and riparian forest fragmentation are determined to be key elements to the functional connectivity. Road infrastructure is distinguished as a critical habitat factor, but not so much an obstacle for the species movement in the riparian corridor. Integration of the Bayesian model posterior colonization probability in the integrated connectivity analysis reveals the importance of the river network density to the otter colonization and locates conservation priorities mainly in the lower parts of the river basin.Synthesis and applications: Both functional and structural connectivity are essential elements in the contexts of ecological network identification for species conservation and recovery. We successfully developed an integrated modelling of both components of connectivity that highlighted the importance of the downstream basin for a well-connected ecological network for the otter.

9,"Triska, FJ",Feb 2007 ,DIN retention-transport through four hydrologically connected zones in a headwater catchment of the Upper Mississippi River,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) retention-transport through a headwater catchment was synthesized from studies encompassing four distinct hydrologic zones of the Shingobee River Headwaters near the origin of the Mississippi River. The hydrologic zones included: (1) hillslope ground water (ridge to bankside riparian); (2) alluvial riparian ground water; (3) ground water discharged through subchannel sediments (hyporheic zone); and (4) channel surface water. During subsurface hillslope transport through Zone 1, DIN, primarily nitrate, decreased from similar to 3 mg-N/l to < 0.1 mg-N/l. Ambient seasonal nitrate:chloride ratios in hillslope flow paths indicated both dilution and biotic processing caused nitrate loss. Biologically available organic carbon controlled biotic nitrate retention during hillslope transport. In the alluvial riparian zone (Zone 2) biologically available organic carbon controlled nitrate depletion although processing of both ambient and amended nitrate was faster during the summer than winter. In the hyporheic zone (Zone 3) and stream surface water (Zone 4) DIN retention was primarily controlled by temperature. Perfusion core studies using hyporheic sediment indicated sufficient organic carbon in bed sediments to retain ground water DIN via coupled nitrification-denitrification. Numerical simulations of seasonal hyporheic sediment nitrification-denitrification rates from perfusion cores adequately predicted surface water ammonium but not nitrate when compared to 5 years of monthly field data (1989-93). Mass balance studies in stream surface water indicated proportionally higher summer than winter N retention. Watershed DIN retention was effective during summer under the current land use of intermittently grazed pasture. However, more intensive land use such as row crop agriculture would decrease nitrate retention efficiency and increase loads to surface water. Understanding DIN retention capacity throughout the system, including special channel features such as sloughs, wetlands and floodplains that provide surface water-ground water connectivity, will be required to develop effective nitrate management strategies.Show less"
10,"FREEMAN, C",Feb 3 1995 ,ION-EXCHANGE MECHANISMS AND THE ENTRAPMENT OF NUTRIENTS BY RIVER BIOFILMS,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Biofilms envelop all surfaces in aquatic ecosystems.  They possess an extremely efficient nutrient entrapment mechanism which is widely believed to be mediated through ion exchange processes.  During a field experiment, potassium and bromide were transported along a 105 m reach at different rates.  The distance between the two solute pulses increased with increasing distance downstream.  And, in a laboratory experiment, changing the ionic composition of waters overlying the biofilm influenced the retention of (phenolic) material by that biofilm.  An analogy was drawn with ion chromatography (IC):  In IC, different ions show different rates of progress through the column (retention times), and also show increasing separation between peaks with increasing distance from the point of injection (column length).  Likewise, the affinity of a given ion for the column can be modified by manipulation of the ionic composition of overlying waters (eluent).  The observed similarities between IC columns and the biofilm-coated stream channel may therefore represent a degree of experimental support for the putative involvement of ion exchange in the biofilm nutrient entrapment mechanism.Show less"
11,"Buchanan, BP",Jan 15 2022 ,A machine learning approach to identify barriers in stream networks demonstrates high prevalence of unmapped riverine dams,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Restoring stream ecosystem integrity by removing unused or derelict dams has become a priority for watershed conservation globally. However, efforts to restore connectivity are constrained by the availability of accurate dam inventories which often overlook smaller unmapped riverine dams. Here we develop and test a machine learning approach to identify unmapped dams using a combination of publicly available topographic and geospatial habitat data. Specifically, we trained a random forest classification algorithm to identify unmapped dams using digitally engineered predictor variables and known dam sites for validation. We applied our algorithm to two subbasins in the Hudson River watershed, USA, and quantified connectivity impacts, as well as evaluated a range of predictor sets to examine tradeoffs between classification accuracy and model parameterization effort. The random forest classifier achieved high accuracy in predicting dam sites (true positive rate = 89%, false positive rate = 1.2%) using a subset of variables related to stream slope and presence of upstream lentic habitats. Unmapped dams were prevalent throughout the two test watersheds. In fact, existing dam inventories underestimated the true number of dams by similar to 80-94%. Accounting for previously unmapped dams resulted in a 62-90% decrease in dendritic connectivity indices for migratory fishes. Unmapped dams may be pervasive and can dramatically bias stream connectivity information. However, we find that machine learning approaches can provide an accurate and scalable means of identifying unmapped dams that can guide efforts to develop accurate dam inventories, thereby informing and empowering efforts to better manage them.Show less"
12,"Dudley-Southern, M",Feb 2015 ,Temporal responses of groundwater-surface water exchange to successive storm events,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Groundwater-surface water exchange within the hyporheic zone is widely recognized as a key mechanism controlling the fate of nutrients within catchments. In gaining river systems, groundwater-surface water interactions are constrained by upwelling groundwater but there is increasing evidence that a rapid rise in river stage during storm events can result in a temporary reversal of vertical hydraulic gradients, leading to surface water infiltration into the subsurface and supply of surface-borne reactive solutes to this biogeochemically active interface. At a UK study site, using logged hydraulic heads in the surface water, riverbed, and riverbanks and logged electrical conductivity at multiple depths in the riverbed we show that storm events can lead to a temporary reversal of vertical hydraulic gradient with mixing evident up to 30 cm beneath the riverbed. Cross-channel variability is evident, with the center of the channel consistently having shorter reversals of hydraulic gradient, compared to the channel margins. The direction of shallow subsurface riverbank flow at the site is also reactive to storm events, temporarily aligning with the surface flow direction and then reverting back to preevent conditions. Such a transition of flow paths during events is also likely to lead to expansion of lateral hyporheic exchange. This study provides evidence that storm events can be a key driver of enhanced hyporheic exchange in gaining river systems, which may support nutrient reactions beyond the duration of event-driven change. Our observations demonstrate the dynamic nature of the hyporheic zone, which should be considered when evaluating its biogeochemical function.Show less"
13,"Miller, RL",Feb 2022 ,Reduced-complexity model of stream temperature,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"In this article, a process-based model of time-varying stream temperatures is developed. The integrated compartment-based model balances a need to account for the major physical components of the heat balance at specific sites while maintaining computational efficiency. The ability of the model to simulate instantaneous temperatures is demonstrated at six study locations in the sub-tropical, low-gradient region of Southern Louisiana, USA. The model yielded Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) scores of 0.9 and above and an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.07 degrees C for hourly water temperature over a six-month period. The parameter sensitivity analysis demonstrates the variable significance of vaporization and bed sediment conduction across the different study locations. The results show that the sediment heat exchange may have a significant seasonal effect on the energy budgets of streams where flows are a large component of the heat balance in temperate climates. The model is well-suited to serve as a simple physically based thermal impact assessment tool for streams and potentially many other types of waterbodies as well. The model also complements the widely used meteorological- and statistical-based methodologies applied in the development of tributary and headwater temperature boundary conditions for large-scale river temperature studies.Show less"
14,"Van Looy, K",Aug 2013 ,A scale-sensitive connectivity analysis to identify ecological networks and conservation value in river networks,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,"Existing methods for connectivity analysis still encounter difficulties in explaining functional relationships between network structure and ecological patterns over larger territories or complex structures like dendritic river networks. We propose a method that addresses the problem of scale and resolution in the connectivity analysis of dendritic network structures, illustrated here for the re-colonization of the French Loire river basin by the European otter. The ecological niche factor approach is applied to infer favourable habitat in the river network based on large scale data of land use and hydro-morphology of river segments for the entire river basin. These analyses identified the stressors to the riparian zone of channel straightening, urbanisation and forest fragmentation as the principal factors explaining otter occurrence. Using this estimate of habitat favourability, we used the Integral Index of Connectivity to quantify habitat availability and connectivity in the dendritic river network. When we calculate the integral index of connectivity over different spatial extents by constraining network distances, the scale-sensitivity of the network's connectivity emerges. Accounting for high mobility by entering larger network distances in the analysis identifies conservation networks and priorities mainly in downstream parts of the river basin, whereas with smaller network distances, more restricted high quality areas in central and upstream parts are highlighted. The presented approach performed better than distribution modelling approaches in explaining species occurrence over the river network and confirms the crucial aspect of connectivity in otter re-colonization.Show less"
15,"Hudson, PF",Jul 15 2013 ,A new longitudinal approach to assess hydrologic connectivity: Embanked floodplain inundation along the lower Mississippi River,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hydrologic connectivity is fundamental to understanding floodplain processes along meandering river corridors. This study contributes to understanding hydrologic connectivity by utilizing a high resolution Light Detection and Ranging DEM with a new GIS-based approach for identifying the precise elevation of flood stage. The method created a high-resolution longitudinal channel bank profile, enabling a detailed examination of embanked floodplain hydrologic connectivity. A simple channel cross-section approach is likely to result in a large underestimation of floodplain inundation and hydrologic connectivity along meandering river floodplains because of differences in the elevation of the natural levee surface relative to floodplain bottoms and the considerable variability in the elevation of the channel bank profile. There is a large disparity in discharge duration associated with floodplain inundation in comparison to river channel bank inundation. A discharge duration of 10% is associated with inundation of 87% of the floodplain surface whereas only 53% of the channel bank profile is overtopped. An apparent threshold in inundation occurs as the discharge duration decreases below about 35%. While a duration of 25% results in very little of the channel bank being overtopped, it inundates 50% of the floodplain surface. Floodplain borrow pits, which are created in association with dike construction, represent a constant anthropogenic influence on the lower Mississippi embanked floodplain morphology, and are inundated by low discharge magnitudes. The results of the investigation shed new light on the topic of hydrologic connectivity for an important embanked fluvial system that has previously received little attention concerning its physical floodplain processes.

16,"Lamontagne, S",Nov 2007 ,Estimation of hyporheic water residence time in situ using Rn-222 disequilibrium,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS,"Radon-222 is a naturally occurring radioactive gas (half-life = 3.8 d) that is emitted by virtually all geologic materials. Stream sediment porewater tends to approach an equilibrium Rn-222 activity determined by the Rn-222 production rate of the sediments and radon half-life. However, this equilibrium may not be reached when porewaters are diluted with low Rn-222 surface waters by hyporheic exchange. Thus, the hyporheic water residence time (t(h)) can be estimated in situ based on the difference in measured hyporheic Rn-222 activity relative to Rn-222 activity in the absence of hyporheic exchange. To validate Rn-222-derived t(h) estimates, a pulse in-stream bromide injection and a continuous in-stream injection of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) were made in a subtropical stream (Swamp Oak Creek, Australia) along a reach with a sand, gravel, and cobble streambed. The bromide injection estimated t(h) indirectly from the shape of upstream and downstream in-stream breakthrough curves, whereas the SF6 injection estimated t(h) directly by the determination of hyporheic breakthrough curves. The average t(h) obtained with Rn-222 disequilibrium (0.095 +/- 0.086 d; +/- SD) was similar to that obtained using bromide injection (0.10 +/- 0.026 d) and within the range estimated from SF6 injection (0.05-0.2 d). Unlike the commonly used in-stream breakthough curves of injected tracers, the Rn-222 disequilibrium technique is advantageous because it measures t(h) of transient storage for the hyporheic zone only. The Rn-222 disequilibrium technique is only applicable to estimate t(h) in the range of hours to days, but this is the range of interest in many hyporheic studies.Show less"
17,"Stelzer, RS",Oct 2011 ,The dark side of the hyporheic zone: depth profiles of nitrogen and its processing in stream sediments,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Although it is well known that sediments can be hot spots for nitrogen transformation in streams, many previous studies have confined measurements of denitrification and nitrate retention to shallow sediments (<5 cm deep). We determined the extent of nitrate processing in deeper sediments of a sand plains stream (Emmons Creek) by measuring denitrification in core sections to a depth of 25 cm and by assessing vertical nitrate profiles, with peepers and piezometers, to a depth of 70 cm.2. Denitrification rates of sediment slurries based on acetylene block were higher in shallower core sections. However, core sections deeper than 5 cm accounted for 68% of the mean depth-integrated denitrification rate.3. Vertical hydraulic gradient and vertical profiles of pore water chloride concentration suggested that deep ground water upwelled through shallow sediments before discharging to the stream channel. The results of a two-source mixing model based on chloride concentrations suggested that the hyporheic zone was very shallow (<5 cm) in Emmons Creek.4. Vertical profiles showed that nitrate concentration in shallow ground water was about 10-60% of the nitrate concentration of deep ground water. The mean nitrate concentrations of deep and shallow ground water were 2.17 and 0.73 mg NO3-N L-1, respectively.5. Deep ground water tended to be oxic (6.9 mg O-2 L-1) but approached anoxia (0.8 mg O-2 L-1) after passing through shallow, organic carbon-rich sediments, which suggests that the decline in the nitrate concentrations of upwelling ground water was because of denitrification.6. Collectively, our results suggest that there is substantial nitrate removal occurring in deep sediments, below the hyporheic zone, in Emmons Creek. Our findings suggest that not accounting for nitrate removal in deep sediments could lead to underestimates of nitrogen processing in streams and catchments.Show less"
18,"Higashino, M",Jun 2013 ,Quantifying a significance of sediment particle size to hyporheic sedimentary oxygen demand with a permeable stream bed,ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS,"A mechanistic model of sedimentary oxygen demand (SOD) for hyporheic flow is presented. The permeable sediment bed, e.g. sand or fine gravel, is considered with hydraulic conductivity in the range cm/s. Hyporheic pore water flow is induced by pressure fluctuations at the sediment/water interface due to near-bed turbulent coherent motions. A 2-D advection-diffusion equation is linked to the pore water flow model to simulate the effect of advection-dispersion driven by interstitial flow on oxygen transfer through the permeable sediment. Microbial oxygen uptake in the sediment is expressed as a function of the microbial growth rate, and is related to the sediment properties, i.e. the grain diameter and porosity . The model describes the significance of sediment particle size to oxygen transfer through the sediment and microbial oxygen uptake: With increasing grain diameter , the hydraulic conductivity increases so does the oxygen transfer rate, while particle surface area per volume (the available surface area for colonization by biofilms) decreases reducing the microbial oxygen uptake rate. Simulation results show that SOD increases as the hydraulic conductivity increases before a threshold has been reached. After that, SOD diminishes with the increment of the hydraulic conductivity (K).Show less"
19,"Castella, E",Jun 2015 ,Realised and predicted changes in the invertebrate benthos after restoration of connectivity to the floodplain of a large river,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"River-floodplain interactions (i.e. lateral connectivity) are a major driver of the structure and function of the biota in floodplain waterbodies. Therefore, the enhancement of lateral connectivity is a key focus of large river restoration. The Rhone River restoration project in France includes an array of floodplain habitats and restoration measures, offering opportunities to test the predictability of changes in taxon abundance after connectivity restoration. Quantitative samples of benthic macroinvertebrates taken before restoration were used to derive generalised additive models (GAMs) relating the density of taxa to an index of lateral connectivity. The index combined the diversity of sediment grain size, its organic content, vegetation cover and the water's electrical conductivity. GAMs were used to predict changes in taxon density and between-site (i.e. beta) diversity 2 and 4years after restoration at 34 sites (14 unrestored, eight reconnected to the river, six dredged, six restored by increasing river flow). Observed post-restoration changes included an increase in the density of rheophilous taxa and an increase of beta-diversity among restored sites. Fifty-four GAMs (27% of the taxa) were selected for post-restoration predictions. Predictions from these models matched observations for a set of Trichoptera and other taxa with large density changes after restoration. The quality of predictions of density changes was poor on average among sites, but higher for sites where large changes in lateral connectivity occurred. Taxon-level predictions partly explained increased beta-diversity in restored sites, suggesting that predictions based on a subset of individual taxa can be used to predict community-level changes. Our models can guide restoration measures in the Rhone and other rivers. Our results also show the benefit of diversifying restoration actions at the scale of entire floodplains. Post-restoration trajectories should be monitored over long periods to improve the identification of the key environmental predictors of biotic changes, especially at the less connected floodplain sites.Show less"
20,"Leach, JA",Aug 15 2010 ,Above-stream microclimate and stream surface energy exchanges in a wildfire-disturbed riparian zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream temperature and riparian microclimate were characterized for a 1.5 km wildfire-disturbed reach of Fishtrap Creek, located north of Kamloops, British Columbia. A deterministic net radiation model was developed using hemispherical canopy images coupled with on-site microclimate measurements. Modelled net radiation agreed reasonably with measured net radiation. Air temperature and humidity measured at two locations above the stream, separated by 900 m, were generally similar, whereas wind speed was poorly correlated between the two sites. Modelled net radiation varied considerably along the reach, and measurements at a single location did not provide a reliable estimate of the modelled reach average. During summer, net radiation dominated the surface heat exchanges, particularly because the sensible and latent heat fluxes were normally of opposite sign and thus tended to cancel each other. All surface heat fluxes shifted to negative values in autumn and were of similar magnitude through winter. In March, net radiation became positive, but heat gains were cancelled by sensible and latent heat fluxes, which remained negative. A modelling exercise using three canopy cover scenarios (current, simulated pre-wildfire and simulated complete vegetation removal) showed that net radiation under the standing dead trees was double that modelled for the pre-fire canopy cover. However, post-disturbance standing dead trees reduce daytime net radiation reaching the stream surface by one-third compared with complete vegetation removal. The results of this study have highlighted the need to account for reach-scale spatial variability of energy exchange processes, especially net radiation, when modelling stream energy budgets.

21,"Blanco, JE",Mar 2006 ,"Hierarchical contribution of river-ocean connectivity, water chemistry, hydraulics, and substrate to the distribution of diadromous snails in Puerto Rican streams",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Diadromous faunas dominate most tropical coastal streams and rivers, but the factors controlling their distribution are not well understood. Our study documents abiotic variables controlling the distribution and abundance of the diadromous snail Neritina virginea (Gastropoda:Neritidae) in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. An intensive survey of N. virginea density and shell size, and channel substrate, velocity, and depth was conducted at microhabitat, habitat, and reach scales of a coastal plain reach of the Rio Mameyes between August and December 2000. In addition, the inland extent of distribution (stream-network scale) and presence (regional scale) of N. virginea were surveyed in 32 coastal rivers around the island during summer 2001 and 2003. At the microhabitat scale, snail density and microhabitat electivity were greater in patches consisting of a mix of boulders and cobbles than in other types of substrate. At the habitat scale, snail density increased with depth. At the reach scale, snail density increased with fast and turbulent flows (riffle > pools > pond), whereas snail size showed the opposite pattern. At the regional scale, populations were present in 13 of 32 streams. Populations of N. virginea were not found in rivers that were disconnected from the ocean for most of the year because of channel dewatering, formation of sediment bars at their mouths, and low mean monthly discharge (Q = 0.69 m(3)/s). In contrast, rivers with N. virginea populations had a permanent (Q = 4.04 m(3)/s) or seasonal (Q = 2.88 m(3)/s) connection to the ocean over the year. At the regional scale, the inland distribution of populations was not correlated with stream gradient, but was negatively correlated with concentrations of SiO2, P, and acid neutralizing capacity of the water. Populations colonized montane reaches in only 5 rivers, all of which were forested and protected. Our study highlights the importance of taking a hierarchical approach in managing tropical coastal rivers, and the usefulness of neritid snails as biological indicators of the physical and chemical integrity of rivers.Show less"
22,"Murgulet, D",Dec 1 2016 ,"Impact of hydrological alterations on river-groundwater exchange and water quality in a semi-arid area: Nueces River, Texas",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"There is a lack of understanding and methods for assessing the effects of anthropogenic disruptions, (i.e. river fragmentation due to dam construction) on the extent and degree of groundwater-surface water interaction and geochemical processes affecting the quality of water in semi-arid, coastal catchments. This study applied a novel combination of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and elemental and isotope geochemistry in a coastal river disturbed by extended drought and periodic flooding due to the operation of multiple dams. Geochemical analyses show that the saltwater barrier causes an increase in salinity in surface water in the downstream river as a result of limited freshwater inflows, strong evaporation effects on shallow groundwater and mostly stagnant river water, and is not due to saltwater intrusion by tidal flooding. Discharge from bank storage is dominant (similar to 84%) in the downstream fragment and its contribution could increase salinity levels within the hyporheic zone and surface water. When surface water levels go up due to upstream freshwater releases the river temporarily displaces high salinity water trapped in the hyporheic zone to the underlying aquifer. Geochemical modeling shows a higher contribution of distant and deeper groundwater (similar to 40%) in the upstream river and lower discharge from bank storage (similar to 13%) through the hyporheic zone. Recharge frombank storage is a source of high salt to both upstream and downstream portions of the river but its contribution is higher below the dam. Continuous ERT imaging of the river bed complements geochemistry findings and indicate that while lithologically similar, downstream of the dam, the shallow aquifer is affected by salinization while fresher water saturates the aquifer in the upstream fragment. The relative contribution of flows (i.e. surface water releases or groundwater discharge) as related to the river fragmentation control changes of streamwater chemistry and likely impact the interpretation of seasonal trends.

23,"Park, E",Sep 1 2017 ,The hydro-geomorphologic complexity of the lower Amazon River floodplain and hydrological connectivity assessed by remote sensing and field control,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,"Hydrological connectivity processes along the lower Amazon River floodplain at Lago Miratuba Floodplain (LMF) were analyzed based on remote sensing and field measurements. Connectivity processes are related to 12 geomorphic sub-units of the floodplain that are interconnected at different stage thresholds through channelized and overbank flow paths, while lakes act as reservoirs for flood waters, local rainfall, and water table saturation-seepage. Hydrological connectivity processes along the floodplain happen through complex internal routings of water flows over space and time, mainly along floodplain channels and breached levees. The contribution of local recharge (mainly rainfall) was decoupled from river recharge (river hydrological connection to floodplain) because precipitations and local runoff also recharge the floodplain. The hydrological connectivity of the 12 geomorphic units varied significantly from each other, because the inundation and the floodplain connections with the river were initiated at specific river stage thresholds for each sub-unit.An interesting finding is that connections with the river for all units were initiated through channelized flows below the bankfull stage of the Amazon River. The connectivity processes over different geomorphic units are also not correlated with their minimum distance (shortest lines) from the river. This implies that a ""flood pulse"" model largely concerned with lateral connectivity (mostly through overbank diffusion) only partially explains the complex hydrological connectivity processes at a regional scale along the complex lower Amazon River floodplain. Thus, for hydrological connectivity assessments in the Amazon River floodplain, reach-by-reach scale studies have to be carried out, relating the hydro-geomorphologic processes (channelized flow routing paths, overbank diffusion, and local recharge) to the internal geomorphic variability and complexity of the floodplain.

24,"Wells, NS",Aug 1 2021 ,Flow regulates biological NO3- and N2O production in a turbid sub-tropical stream,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,"Streams play a critical role in attenuating the excess reactive nitrogen (N) generated from human activities. Consequently, streams can also emit significant amounts of the potent greenhouse gas N2O. Models and manipulative experiments now suggest that hydrology regulates the balance between N removal and N2O production, but validating this hypothesis under field conditions has been difficult. We aimed to redress this knowledge gap by measuring changes in the concentration and isotopic composition of NO3- (delta O-18-NO3-, delta N-15-NO3-) and N2O (delta O-18-N2O, delta N-15-N2O, N-15-N2O site preference) in the sediments and surface water of a 30 m stream reach as discharge dropped from 2.7 to 1.8 m(3) s(-1). Over the eight-day measurement period the changes in conductivity, delta O-18-H2O, and Rn-222 indicated that hyporheic mixing decreased and net groundwater inputs increased as discharge declined. This coincided with increases in surface water NO3- (1-3 mg N l(-1)) and N2O (700-1000% saturation) that were beyond what could be explained by increased groundwater N inputs. Instead, both N2O and NO3- isotopic composition indicated that concentration increases were caused by increasing within-stream production (nitrification), rather than decreased reduction (denitrification), as hyporheic exchange decreased. This highlights the importance of oxidising processes in regulating N cycling even under strongly heterotrophic conditions (productivity/respiration: 0.005-0.2). Together these findings provide a first empirical confirmation that relatively short term (daily-weekly) stream flow dynamics directly regulate biological cycling of both NO3- and N2O.

A prior study proposed a method for estimating the hyporheic zone's depth using heat transfer analysis; this approach's high sensitivity compared with conventional tracer tests made it more appropriate for delineate the hyporheic zone depth. However, that method treated all related parameters as deterministic values, while real-world parameters are not fixed but vary widely around their means. In this study, we improved on this approach by converting it into a probabilistic method, in which the principal parameters in the governing equation were considered random values and were sampled using Monte-Carlo simulation. We conducted repeated heat transfer analyses for each case and collected the resulting hyporheic zone depths as probabilistic distributions. This allowed us to calculate the distribution of the hyporheic zone and its mean value more accurately and time-efficiently.Show less"
26,"Brugger, A",May 30 2001 ,"Immobilization and bacterial utilization of dissolved organic carbon entering the riparian zone of the alpine Enns River, Austria",AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"In order to understand the factors controlling the removal of riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the riparian zone of an alpine river, concentrations of DOC and dissolved oxygen, as well as bacterial abundance and production, were determined in interstitial waters of an experimental bank filtration site of the Enns River, Austria. Four porewater stations exhibiting differing sedimentologic and hydrologic characteristics were sampled over an annual cycle. We found that concentrations of DOG, oxygen, bacterial biomass and production decreased significantly within the first meter from the sediment-water interface. Differences in the grain size distribution among the sampling stations led to spatial heterogeneity in the permeability of the riparian sediments and in the hydraulic residence time of the infiltrating river water, resulting in specific patterns in DOC immobilization and microbial respiration. Porewater bacterial abundance and production and apparent microbial oxygen consumption were positively correlated with the hydraulic residence time of the infiltrating water. DOC occasionally accumulated in the shallow porewater layers during the winter. During the summer, DOC infiltrating from the river surface potentially explained only 36 +/- 25% of the apparent interstitial oxygen consumption. This suggests that particulate organic carbon (POC) contributes substantially to the microbial organic carbon supply in the hyporheic zone. We conclude that: the availability of POC rather than DOC infiltration determines hyporheic microbial metabolism.Show less"
27,"Varay, LS",Dec 2017 ,Estimation of snow and glacial melt contribution through stable isotopes and assessment of its impact on river morphology through stream power approach in two Himalayan river basins,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"The impact of increased temperature on the Third Pole, as the Himalayas is referred to, and the likely cascading impacts on the general downstream hydrology have been widely noted. However, the impact on fluvial geomorphology has not received specific attention. Change in the glacial domain in terms of melt increase will change discharge and sediment flux into fluvial system, which will induce changes in fluvial processes and forms. The present work attempts to study this process-based glacio-fluvial coupling in the two neighbouring glaciated river basins in the Northwest Himalaya, viz., the Sutlej and the Yamuna river basins till the mountain front. A total of 194 samples of river, tributary and groundwater of pre-and post-monsoon seasons in the two river basins were analysed for stable isotopes. The trend of delta O-18 and electrical conductivity along the mainstream gives qualitative idea on the influence of headwaters in the downstream of the catchment thereby allowing inference on melt contribution. Further, two component mixing model using stable oxygen isotope of two seasons water samples showed that melt contributes about 41.1-66.8 and 6.6-10.6% at different points to the total river discharge in the Sutlej and the Tons River (the glaciated, major tributary of the Yamuna River) basins, respectively. For different scenarios of increase in melt, stream power increase in the Sutlej River basin is significant as opposed to the Tons River. River channel in the Sutlej River basin will be significantly more impacted in comparison with the Yamuna River system.Show less"
28,"Naranjo, RC",Jan 26 2012 ,The use of multiobjective calibration and regional sensitivity analysis in simulating hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We describe an approach for calibrating a two-dimensional (2-D) flow model of hyporheic exchange using observations of temperature and pressure to estimate hydraulic and thermal properties. A longitudinal 2-D heat and flow model was constructed for a riffle-pool sequence to simulate flow paths and flux rates for variable discharge conditions. A uniform random sampling approach was used to examine the solution space and identify optimal values at local and regional scales. We used a regional sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of parameter correlation and nonuniqueness commonly encountered in multidimensional modeling. The results from this study demonstrate the ability to estimate hydraulic and thermal parameters using measurements of temperature and pressure to simulate exchange and flow paths. Examination of the local parameter space provides the potential for refinement of zones that are used to represent sediment heterogeneity within the model. The results indicate vertical hydraulic conductivity was not identifiable solely using pressure observations; however, a distinct minimum was identified using temperature observations. The measured temperature and pressure and estimated vertical hydraulic conductivity values indicate the presence of a discontinuous low-permeability deposit that limits the vertical penetration of seepage beneath the riffle, whereas there is a much greater exchange where the low-permeability deposit is absent. Using both temperature and pressure to constrain the parameter estimation process provides the lowest overall root-mean- square error as compared to using solely temperature or pressure observations. This study demonstrates the benefits of combining continuous temperature and pressure for simulating hyporheic exchange and flow in a riffle-pool sequence.Show less"
29,"Ou, CM",Aug 2014 ,Evolution characters of water exchange abilities between Dongting Lake and Yangtze River,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,"By using field-survey hydrological data of the related control stations in Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River mainstream in 1951-2010, the evolution characters of water exchange abilities between the two water bodies and their response to the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) from different time scales are analyzed based on their hydraulic relations. The results are shown as follows. Firstly, during July-September, the replenishment ability of Three Outlets to Dongting Lake is stronger, and in January-March, the replenishment ability of Dongting Lake to Yangtze River is stronger. Secondly, there has been an obvious inter-decadal wave on the water exchange coefficient between Dongting Lake and Yangtze River. In 1951-1958 and 1959-1968, the replenishment ability of Three Outlets to Dongting Lake was stronger, but in 2003-2010, the replenishment ability of Dongting Lake to Yangtze River has been strengthened. Thirdly, the spill-division ability of Three Outlets weakens, and the water of Dongting Lake coming from Three Outlets decreases either in typical years or under different dispatching modes of the TGR after the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir. Furthermore, the water of Dongting Lake coming from Four Rivers takes the dominant position, which obviously enhances the replenishment ability of Dongting Lake to Yangtze River. Fourthly, if the effect of the runoff fluctuation in the basin is not considered, the evolution characters of the exchange capacities and the exchange process between Dongting Lake and Yangtze River in different time scales are generally changed with the variation of the water exchange amount between them, although the factors influencing the water exchange capacities between them is very complex. These show that there is an in-line growth or decline relation between the river-lake water exchange ability and the river-lake water exchange amount.Show less"
30,"Mouhri, A",Nov 11 2013 ,Designing a multi-scale sampling system of stream-aquifer interfaces in a sedimentary basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A methodological framework is proposed for designing a multi-scale sampling system to quantify the stream-aquifer interactions in a multi-layer aquifer system. First, geophysical and drilling investigations are performed to assess the regional structure of the aquifer system and the local connectivity between streams and aquifer units. At the catchment scale, the investigations permit to define the composition of the upper aquifer unit. At the local scale, the connectivity status between streams and aquifer units is evaluated using various settings for electrical resistivity tomographies. These geophysical investigations are then used to select local monitoring stations (LMSs) along the stream network. Moreover, piezometric head maps representative of low and high flow regimes are interpolated using geostatistics, which provides distributions of both piezometric heads and standard deviations of the estimation error (STEE). The map of STEE is used to define the location of new piezometers. Altogether, the sampling system allows for monitoring water exchanges on a 40 km(2) watershed along 6 km of the stream network, with a finer hydro-geophysical sampling at each LMS. Finally, temperature profiles in the HZ are interpreted with a coupled thermo-hydro finite element code at the upstream station of the domain. Multiple simulations indicate first proof of evidence for a gaining stream in the upstream part of the sampling domain. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
31,"Sun, JR",Feb 1 2023 ,River fragmentation and barrier impacts on fishes have been greatly underestimated in the upper Mekong River,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"River barriers reduce river connectivity and lead to fragmentation of fish habitats, which can result in decline or even extinction of aquatic biota, including fish populations. In the Mekong basin, previous studies have mainly focused on the impacts of large dams but ignored the impacts of small-scale barriers, or drew conclusions from incomplete barrier databases, potentially leading to research biases. To test the completeness of existing databases and to evaluate the catchment-scale fragmentation level, a detailed investigation of river barriers for the whole Upper Mekong (Lancang catchment) was performed, by conducting visual interpretation of highresolution remotely sensed images. Then, a complete catchment-scale barrier database was created for the first time. By comparing our barrier database with existing databases, this study indicates that 93.7% of river barriers were absent from the existing database, including 75% of dams and 99.5% of small barriers. Barrier density and dendritic connectivity index (DCID and DCIP) were used to measure channel fragmentation within the catchment. Overall, 50.5% of sub-catchments contained river barriers. The Middle region is the most fragmented area within the Lancang catchment, with a median [quartiles] barrier density of 5.34 [0.70-9.67] per 100 km, DCIP value of 49.50 [21.50-90.00] and DCID value of 38.50 [9.00-92.25]. Furthermore, since 2010, distribution ranges of two representative fish species Schizothorax lissolabiatus (a rheophilic cyprinid) and Bagarius yarrelli (a large catfish) have reduced by 19.2% and 32.8% respectively, probably due in part to the construction of river barriers. Our findings indicate that small-scale barriers, in particular weirs and also small dams are the main reason for habitat fragmentation in the Lancang and must be considered alongside large dams in water management and biodiversity conservation within the Mekong.Show less"

This paper presents coordinated streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) modifications, termed Biohydrochemical Enhancement Structures for Streamwater Treatment (BEST), to efficiently drive interchange, attenuating nutrients, metals, and pathogens. Numerical models consisted of sandy HZ with high and low K streambed media components, and variable slope and in situ sediment K. BEST contaminant mitigation was estimated using hyporheic flow and residence time (RT) simulations and contaminant removal rate constants from literature for specific porous media. Hyporheic flows improved, whereas mean RT decreased approximately linearly with increasing slope and in situ K. Despite vast differences in flow and RT, contaminant removal potential was relatively consistent among BEST in which reaction time scales were similar to or shorter than RTs. However, BEST with excessive RTs were less efficient. Most contaminants could be attenuated within a series of BEST 50 m in length, suggesting that BEST could be an effective stormwater best management practice for small streams.

33,"Poole, GC",Jun 2001 ,An ecological perspective on in-stream temperature: Natural heat dynamics and mechanisms of human-caused thermal degradation,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"While external factors (drivers) determine the net heat energy and water delivered to a stream, the internal structure of a stream determines how heat and water will be distributed within and exchanged among a stream's components (channel, alluvial aquifer, and riparian zone/floodplain). Therefore, the interaction between external drivers of stream temperature and the internal structure of integrated stream systems ultimately determines channel water temperature. This paper presents a synoptic, ecologically based discussion of the external drivers of stream temperature, the internal structures and processes that insulate and buffer stream temperatures, and the mechanisms of human influence on stream temperature. It provides a holistic perspective on the diversity of natural dynamics and human activities that influence stream temperature, including discussions of the role of the hyporheic zone. Key management implications include: (1) Protecting or reestablishing in-stream flow is critical for restoring desirable thermal regimes in streams. (2) Modified riparian vegetation, groundwater dynamics, and channel morphology are all important pathways of human influence on channel-water temperature and each pathway should be addressed in management plans. (3) Stream temperature research and monitoring programs will be jeopardized by an inaccurate or incomplete conceptual understanding of complex temporal and spatial stream temperature response patterns to anthropogenic influences. (4) Analyses of land-use history and the historical vs contemporary structure of the stream channel, riparian zone, and alluvial aquifer are important prerequisites for applying mechanistic temperature models to develop management prescriptions to meet in-channel temperature goals.Show less"
34,"Ward, AS",Jan-feb 2016 ,The evolution and state of interdisciplinary hyporheic research,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Hyporheic zones are of broad interest, given their location at the interface between surface and groundwaters, numerous ecological functions, and location as a zone of interdependent physical, chemical, and biological processes. Hyporheic research has been successful in study of individual processes, but our understanding of coupled, interacting processes in hyporheic zones remains limited. Based on an analysis of publications and citations, interest in the hyporhec zone was catalyzed by ecological functions, and interest has become more balanced across disciplines and functions in recent years. Analysis of publications and field studies spanning 12 identified hyporheic processes demonstrates that studies commonly focus on 1-3 processes limiting our ability to characterize interaction or interdependence of hyporheic processes. Analysis of field studies demonstrate that the most frequently studies scales are second- and third-order streams with longitudinal, lateral, and vertical scales of 10-1000+ m, 1-10, and 0-1m, respectively. These studies commonly considered variations spanning timescales of storm events to seasons. I identified a total of 86 variables used to characterize hyporheic processes of which the most frequently reported 14 variables represent more than 50% of all variables found in this analysis. Thus, a relatively small suite of variables may hold key information to enable cross-site comparison of findings. Future hyporheic research should address the challenges of (1) defining common metadata to support interdisciplinary research and cross-site comparison and (2) quantifying spatial and temporal heterogeneity in hyporheic functions to enable multi-scale assessment and prediction of hyporheic processes.

Yet each species has different migration requirements and their natural distribution can include several catchments with multiple dams. Hence, to prioritize candidate rivers for improving accessibility, differences between species and between catchments have to be taken into account. The aim of this study was therefore to analyse the species and river specific effects of river fragmentation on migratory fish on a European scale. The effect of river damming on migratory fish was quantified for all 16 European long- and mid-distance anadromous species and for 33 large European rivers. The historical distribution was compared with the current upstream accessibility of the main river and the current distribution and population status of each species. The observed effects of reduced connectivity were further quantified using the Dendritic Connectivity Index for species and the Fragmentation Index for rivers. Our results showed that only very few rivers are still unaffected by dams in the main stem and that the few remaining viable migratory fish populations in Europe occur in these accessible rivers. Barriers were prioritized for making passable based on the potential accessibility gain and the number of benefitting species, showing that the main stems of the rivers Shannon and Nemunas are the best candidates. It was concluded that evaluating species and river specific effects of fragmentation strongly aids in prioritizing rivers for improving upstream accessibility.Show less"
37,"Hermida, MA",Dec 2019 ,Methodology for the assessment of connectivity and comfort of urban rivers,CITIES,"Urban rivers differ from natural rivers because of the direct connection they have with human habitat. Furthermore, riverbanks are public spaces that contribute to the interaction between natural and urbanized areas and between people from different socioeconomic background. Due to this significance, the main objective of this research was to provide a methodology for the construction of a toolbox that evaluates connectivity and comfort of urban riverbanks, so as to allow comparative visual and numeric analysis between different zones of the same river, distinct rivers in the same city and rivers in various cities. The proposal was based on the disaggregation of the concepts of connectivity and comfort, through the analysis of four dimensions: (a) Spatial and visual accessibility, (b) Continuity of the green corridor, (c) Condition ofpublic space, and (d) Condition of the first built line, expressed in thirteen quantitative condition indicators. For validation, the toolbox was applied to five zones of the Tomebamba River of the city of Cuenca in Ecuador and a series of maps were generated allowing spatial visualization of the results. In addition, an Urban River Sustainability Index (URSI) was developed to reinforce the decision-making processes in planning and urban design.Show less"

While this area has been altered, the New Madrid Floodway and St. John's Bayou account for the only substantial portion of the historic Mississippi River floodplain that remains and provides the only critical connection between backwater/floodplain habitat and the river. Fish passage was evaluated during April-December 2010 using ultrasonic telemetry. Stationary receivers were placed strategically at five locations above and below the structure in St. John's Bayou, in the floodway and the outlet to the Mississippi River. A total of 100 individuals representing 14 species were tagged. Total number of detections during an 8-month period was 1264717. Fifteen individuals representing five species moved into the Mississippi and Ohio rivers; seven individuals returned to St. John's Bayou. Thirteen of the 14 species moved upstream through the structure. Of the 85 individuals that stayed in the bayou, 29 fish passed through the structure for a total of 92 passage events. The downstream:upstream passage was roughly 50:50. Passage was correlated with river rise, with frequency of passage being higher in spring, but passage occurred each month during the study.

39,"Reid, MA",Sep 2012 ,THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY ON FOOD WEB STRUCTURE IN FLOODPLAIN LAKES,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Hydrological connectivity is an important driver of ecosystem structure in floodplain rivers; however, little is known of how hydrological connectivity affects the structure and functioning of food webs in these systems. This study examines aquatic food web structure in 10 floodplain lakes on a dryland river floodplain in eastern Australia across a connectivity gradient. Results for fishes suggest that benthic carbon sources are more important in high connectivity billabongs than in low connectivity billabongs and that pelagic sources are more important in low connectivity billabongs than in high connectivity billabongs. Fishes in less connected billabongs were also found to feed at higher trophic levels than in more connected billabongs. We hypothesize that in high connectivity billabongs, where suitable benthic primary sources are abundant, common fish species such as carp and bony bream feed as detritivores or herbivores; while in low connectivity billabongs, where benthic sources are less abundant, the same species feed as planktivores, insectivores or piscivores. This dietary difference may also be promoted by greater predation efficiency in less structurally complex low connectivity billabongs. The feeding behaviour of these fish species subsequently influences the trophic positions of fishes higher in the food chain and ultimately the total food chain lengths that high and low connectivity billabongs support. The results of this study highlight the importance of hydrological connectivity to the structure of food webs in these systems and the potential for them to be affected by water resource development.

40,"Zhou, T",Apr 2018 ,Riverbed Hydrologic Exchange Dynamics in a Large Regulated River Reach,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydrologic exchange flux (HEF) is an important hydrologic component in river corridors that includes both bidirectional (hyporheic) and unidirectional (gaining/losing) surface water-groundwater exchanges. Quantifying HEF rates in a large regulated river is difficult due to the large spatial domains, complexity of geomorphologic features and subsurface properties, and the great stage variations created by dam operations at multiple time scales. In this study, we developed a method that combined numerical modeling and field measurements for estimating HEF rates across the riverbed in a 7 km long reach of the highly regulated Columbia River. A high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling framework was developed and validated by field measurements and other modeling results to characterize the HEF dynamics across the riverbed. We found that about 85% of the time from 2008 to 2014 the river was losing water with an annual average net HEF rates across the riverbed (Q(z)) of -2.3 m(3) s(-1) (negative indicating downwelling). June was the only month that the river gained water, with monthly averaged Qz of 0.8 m(3) s(-1). We also found that the daily dam operations increased the hourly gross gaining and losing rate over an average year of 8% and 2%, respectively. By investigating the HEF feedbacks at various time scales, we suggest that the dam operations could reduce the HEF at seasonal time scale by decreasing the seasonal flow variations, while also enhance the HEF at subdaily time scale by generating high-frequency discharge variations. These changes could generate significant impacts on biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone.Plain Language Summary Dam operations regulate downstream water flow and modify the surface water and groundwater interactions. In this study, we simulated river and groundwater dynamics in a 7 km long reach of Columbia River using a high-resolution numerical model. Due to the upstream dam regulations, the daily river stage variation of our study reach could be as high as 2 m. We found that about 85% of the time from 2008 to 2014 the river was losing water with an annual average net HEF rates across the riverbed of 2.3 m(3) s(-1). June was the only month that the river gained water, with gaining rate of 0.8 m(3) s(-1). We also found that the daily dam operations enhanced the losing and gaining activities, which may lead to great impact on riverbed biogeochemical processes.Show less"
41,"Liang, XY",Jan 2023 ,Debris flow susceptibility based on the connectivity of potential material sources in the Dadu River Basin,ENGINEERING GEOLOGY,"The Dadu River Basin (DRB) is an important economic corridor on the Chuanxi Plateau. The DRB is located in the highly changeable terrain of the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and is often threatened by debris flows. To mitigate the damage of debris flow disasters to the construction and operation of large infrastructures such as railways, roads and hydropower stations in the DRB, it is necessary to evaluate debris flow susceptibility. The connectivity of potential material sources (CPMS), which proxies the possibility of potential material transfer from the source to the outlet, was calculated using an improved index of connectivity, excess topography and brittle fracture index to identify and quantify debris flow susceptibility. The results show that the IC and the gully scale have a Logartihmic function in the DRB, in which IC decreases as the catchment area increases. In 3967 gullies of the Dadu River and its tributaries, the total connectivity of potential material sources (TCPMS) could be used to distinguish between debris flow gullies and non-debris flow gullies (AUC = 0.748). The TCPMS and average connectivity of potential material sources (ACPMS) were used to classify the scale and activity intensity of the 2398 debris flow gullies into four levels. The moderate-and high-activity intensity and large-and extra large-scale debris flows are mainly distributed in Danba, Luding and Kangding. The results of this study provide reference and evidence for the identification and evaluation of debris flow susceptibility.Show less"
42,"Worman, A",Oct 3 2007 ,Reach scale and evaluation methods as limitations for transient storage properties in streams and rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The value of stream tracer tests depends on appropriate experimental design, accurate evaluation methods and careful generalization of results with account taken to relevant limitations. This paper examines six calibration methods for transient storage models and effects of parameter errors on model generalizations. The residence time of transient storage and retardation factor varied a factor of 8 and 27, respectively, with the choice of method. Methods that emphasize the tail of the tracer breakthrough, such as optimization of log-concentrations, are required to provide accurate estimates of transient storage parameters, whereas optimization using normal values can lead to substantial errors. Moment matching techniques require a solute mass-recovery higher than about 70% for a reliable estimate of the storage capacity. The pumping model provided good estimates of the storage in the hyporheic zone under different stream discharges at two tracer test events with tritiated water in the Hobol River, Norway. The accuracy of the evaluation of the transient storage parameters decreases with distance in the stream caused primarily by decreasing precision in the measurements and insufficient mass-recovery. With distance, more and more time-scales representing the hyporheic zone flow are also manifested as signatures of the tracer breakthrough. In a stream-landscape groundwater system that is characterized by multiple residence time-scales, stream tracer results are limited to specific reach distances and need to be supported by theory or other data when generalized to longer distances.Show less"
43,"Mitton, A",Mar 28 2022 ,Aquifer-Stream Exchanges and the Importance of Groundwater Discharge for Maintaining Instream Habitat and Benthic Macroinvertebrates,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"Periods of streamflow cessation and stream drying are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions of the world due to climate change, land-use change, and increased groundwater pumping. Thus, streams with intermittent flow will likely continue to grow in their global extent, which is thought to already surpass that of perennial streams. Yet, variability in streamflow and aquifer-stream exchange associated with flow cessation and drying is not well understood, nor is the influence of hydrological variability on aquatic communities and their habitat. This study aimed to characterize the heterogeneity of physical and chemical characteristics of habitat and the associated variability in benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities in relation to spatial and temporal variability in streamflow and aquifer-stream exchange. Habitat conditions and BMI communities varied between individual sites, riffle and pool habitat, and between an intermittent riffle and a perennial riffle maintained by groundwater discharge. Unlike other studies, BMI richness, diversity, and abundance were consistently higher at intermittent riffle sites than perennial riffle sites, which were similar in BMI community composition to pool sites. High velocity distinguished the intermittent riffle sites, while two flow-loving BMI taxa distinguished their communities. This suggests that site-specific heterogeneity in habitat conditions was a key control on spatial and temporal variability in BMI communities due to the habitat preferences of certain BMI taxa. Low richness, diversity, and high dominance of highly tolerant taxa across the site suggested long-term patterns of extreme variability in habitat conditions associated with flow cessation and drying were the primary control on BMI communities. Thus, the interactive effects of these controls may produce unexpected patterns in BMI community richness, diversity, and composition in relation to longitudinal patterns of groundwater discharge and flow persistence. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the influence of heterogeneity in environmental conditions at multiple spatial and temporal scales when interpreting relationships between hydrological and abiotic or biotic ecological variable in streams with intermittent flow.Show less"

The number of temporary rivers and the severity of flow intermittence may be increasing in regions affected by climatic drying trends or water abstraction. Despite their abundance, temporary rivers have been historically neglected by ecologists. A recent increase in temporary-river research needs to be supported by new models that generate hypotheses and stimulate further research. In this article, we present three conceptual models that address spatial and temporal patterns in temporary-river biodiversity and biogeochemistry.2. Temporary rivers are characterised by the repeated onset and cessation of flow, and by complex hydrological dynamics in the longitudinal dimension. Longitudinal dynamics, such as advancing and retreating wetted fronts, hydrological connections and disconnections, and gradients in flow permanence, influence biotic communities and nutrient and organic matter processing.3. The first conceptual model concerns connectivity between habitat patches. Variable connectivity suggests that the metacommunity and metapopulation concepts are applicable in temporary rivers. We predict that aggregations of local communities in the isolated water bodies of temporary rivers function as metacommunities. These metacommunities may become longitudinally nested due to interspecific differences in dispersal and mortality. The metapopulation concept applies to some temporary river species, but not all. In stable metapopulations, rates of local extinction are balanced by recolonisation. However, extinction and recolonisation in many temporary-river species are decoupled by frequent disturbances, and populations of these species are usually expanding or contracting.4. The second conceptual model predicts that large-scale biodiversity varies as a function of aquatic and terrestrial patch dynamics and water-level fluctuations. Habitat mosaics in temporary rivers change in composition and configuration in response to inundation and drying, and these changes elicit a range of biotic responses. In the model, aquatic biodiversity initially increases directly with water level due to increasing abundance of aquatic patches. When most of the channel is inundated and most aquatic patches are connected, further increases in aquatic habitat and connectivity cause aquatic biodiversity to decline due to community homogenisation and reduced habitat diversity. The predicted responses of terrestrial biodiversity to changes in water level are the inverse of aquatic biodiversity responses.5. The third conceptual model represents temporary rivers as longitudinal, punctuated biogeochemical reactors. Advancing fronts carry water, solutes and particulate organic matter downstream; subsequent flow recessions and drying result in deposition of transported material in reserves such as pools and bar tops. Material processing is rapid during inundated periods and slower during dry periods. The efficiency of material processing is predicted to increase with the number of cycles of transport, deposition and processing that occur down the length of a temporary river.6. We end with a call for conservation and resource management that addresses the unique properties of temporary rivers. Primary objectives for effective temporary river management are preservation or restoration of aquatic-terrestrial habitat mosaics, preservation or restoration of natural flow intermittence, and identification of flow requirements for highly valued species and processes.Show less"
45,"Huang, S",Oct 2022 ,Coupling Machine Learning Into Hydrodynamic Models to Improve River Modeling With Complex Boundary Conditions,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Rivers play an important role in water supply, irrigation, navigation, and ecological maintenance. Forecasting the river hydrodynamic changes is critical for flood management under climate change and intensified human activities. However, efficient and accurate river modeling is challenging, especially with complex lake boundary conditions and uncontrolled downstream boundary conditions. Here, we proposed a coupled framework by taking the advantages of interpretability of physical hydrodynamic modeling and the adaptability of machine learning. Specifically, we coupled the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a 1-D HydroDynamic model (GRU-HD) and applied it to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest river in China. We show that the GRU-HD model could quickly and accurately simulate the water levels, streamflow, and water exchange rates between the Yangtze River and two important lakes (Poyang and Dongting), with most of the Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE $\mathrm{K}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{E}$) above 0.90. Using machine learning-based predicted water levels, instead of the rating curve approach, as the downstream boundary conditions could improve the accuracy of modeling the downstream water levels of the lake-connected river system. The GRU-HD model is dedicated to the synergy of physical modeling and machine learning, providing a powerful avenue for modeling rivers with complex boundary conditions.Show less"
46,"Vanderhoof, MK",Feb 2018 ,"The influence of data characteristics on detecting wetland/stream surface-water connections in the Delmarva Peninsula, Maryland and Delaware",WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"The dependence of downstream waters on upstream ecosystems necessitates an improved understanding of watershed-scale hydrological interactions including connections between wetlands and streams. An evaluation of such connections is challenging when, (1) accurate and complete datasets of wetland and stream locations are often not available and (2) natural variability in surface-water extent influences the frequency and duration of wetland/stream connectivity. The Upper Choptank River watershed on the Delmarva Peninsula in eastern Maryland and Delaware is dominated by a high density of small, forested wetlands. In this analysis, wetland/stream surface water connections were quantified using multiple wetland and stream datasets, including headwater streams and depressions mapped from a lidar-derived digital elevation model. Surface-water extent was mapped across the watershed for spring 2015 using Landsat-8, Radarsat-2 and Worldview-3 imagery. The frequency of wetland/stream connections increased as a more complete and accurate stream dataset was used and surface-water extent was included, in particular when the spatial resolution of the imagery was finer (i.e., < 10 m). Depending on the datasets used, 12-60% of wetlands by count (21-93% of wetlands by area) experienced surface-water interactions with streams during spring 2015. This translated into a range of 50-94% of the watershed contributing direct surface water runoff to streamflow. This finding suggests that our interpretation of the frequency and duration of wetland/stream connections will be influenced not only by the spatial and temporal characteristics of wetlands, streams and potential flowpaths, but also by the completeness, accuracy and resolution of input datasets.Show less"
47,"Grant, SB",May 19 2012 ,Effective diffusivity and mass flux across the sediment-water interface in streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of water between a stream and its hyporheic zone (defined as the sediment beneath and immediately adjacent to a stream) underpins many ecological and hydrological functions in turbulent streams. Hyporheic exchange can be parameterized in terms of an effective diffusion coefficient D-eff and considerable effort has gone into developing process-based models and empirical correlations for predicting the value of this transport parameter. In this paper we demonstrate previous laboratory estimates for D-eff can be biased by as much as a factor of 10, due to errors in the equations and/or ambiguities in the variables used to reduce data from transient tracer experiments in flow-through and recirculating flumes. After correcting these problems, an analysis of 93 previously published flume experiments reveals D-eff depends on properties of the tracer (molecular diffusivity), flow field (shear velocity, kinematic viscosity), and sediment bed (permeability and depth). The shear velocity depends implicitly on the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, which captures the influence of bed roughness and bed forms on hyporheic exchange in both laboratory and field studies. The dependence of D-eff on sediment bed depth is consistent with the hypothesis that coherent turbulence in the water column drives mass transport across the sediment-water interface. Furthermore, the dependence of D-eff on sediment bed depth raises the possibility that hyporheic exchange rates measured in the laboratory are not representative of hyporheic exchange rates in the field.Show less"
48,"Phogat, V",Oct 2017 ,Long-Term Quantification of Stream-Aquifer Exchange in a Variably-Saturated Heterogeneous Environment,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"A variably-saturated finite element model HYDRUS-2D was used to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of stream-aquifer exchange for a perennial stream flowing through an undulating catchment and underlain by heterogeneous geology. The model was first calibrated and validated using piezometric heads measured near the stream. The model was then used a) to quantify the long-term dynamics of exchange at stream-aquifer interface and the water balance in the domain, and b) to evaluate the impact of anisotropy of geological materials, thickness (w) and hydraulic conductivity (K-s ) of the low permeability layer at the streambed, and water table fluctuations on the extent of exchange. Simulated pressure heads in the domain revealed that seasonal groundwater fluctuations were more pronounced near the stream. Daily discharge to the stream varied from 0.05 to 0.3 mm/day, annual discharge ranged from 59 to 74 mm, and the overall water balance showed a discharge (-54 mm) from the domain during 2000-2012. A five-fold increase in K (s) of the low permeability layer enhanced discharge to the stream by 14% (10 mm/year) whereas an increase in the thickness of the layer by 1 m had a low impact (2.4 mm/year). A 2-m drawdown of the water table transformed a connected and gaining system into a losing, disconnected system. These results suggest that depletion of groundwater due to climate change or excessive pumping could have a pronounced impact on the availability of water resources and sustainability of the existing water-dependent ecosystem.Show less"
49,"Ramulifho, PA",Jan 2018 ,A conceptual framework towards more holistic freshwater conservation planning through incorporation of stream connectivity and thermal vulnerability,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health and composition of aquatic ecosystems, and together with flow, is recognised as one of the most influential abiotic drivers of aquatic ecosystem processes affecting species distribution. Changes in thermal conditions in aquatic systems are driven by on-going human-induced climate change, hydrological, regional and structural factors. Here, we quantified the impact of instream impoundments on the natural longitudinal connectivity and estimated thermal vulnerability of catchments based on the functional relationship between changing temperature and the profile gradient of rivers in the eastern portion of South Africa. We identified catchments that are most vulnerable to thermal stress based on cold-water adapted species' tolerance to thermal changes. More than half of all studied catchments include rivers that are relatively intact longitudinally, with notable exceptions being rivers in the central portion of the study area. Thermal condition of high elevation sites is more heavily impacted by impoundments and consequently thermal vulnerability of these sites are higher. Blephariceridae and Notonemouridae, the most thermophobic families, are likely to become locally threatened or extinct, in the absence of connectivity. The quantification of stream connectivity and vulnerability of organisms to thermal changes in river systems are important decision making tools for effective adaptive and holistic conservation planning strategies.
