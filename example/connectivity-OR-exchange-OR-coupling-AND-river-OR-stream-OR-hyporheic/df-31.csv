The Songhua River Basin (SRB) serves as a major grain commodity basin and is located in the northeastern region of China. Recent studies have identified a gradual decrease in stream flows, which presents a serious risk to water resources of the region. It is therefore necessary to assess the variation in stream flow and to predict the future of stream flows and droughts to make a comprehensive plan for agricultural irrigation. The simulation of monthly stream flows and the investigation of the influence of climate on the stream flow in the SRB were performed by utilizing the Integrated Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool coupled with observed precipitation data, as well as the Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE's Water Resources) precipitation product. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC) was used to assess the WEAP efficiency. During the time of calibration, NSC was obtained as 0.90 and 0.67 using observed and APHRODITE precipitation data, respectively. The results indicate that WEAP can be used effectively in the SRB. The application of the model suggested a maximum decline in stream flow, reaching 24% until the end of 21st century under future climate change scenarios. The drought indices (standardized drought index and percent of normal index) demonstrated that chances of severe to extreme drought events are highest in 2059, 2060 and 2085, while in the remaining time period mild to moderate drought events may occur in the entire study area. The drought duration, severity and intensity for the period of 2011-2099 under all scenarios, [(A1B: 12, - 1.55, - 0.12), (A2: 12, - 1.41, - 0.09), (max. wetting and warming conditions: 12, - 1.37, - 0.11) and (min. wetting and warming conditions: 12, - 1.69, - 0.19)], respectively.Show less"
1,"Klymak, JM",Feb 16 2016 ,Submesoscale streamers exchange water on the north wall of the Gulf Stream,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"The Gulf Stream is a major conduit of warm surface water from the tropics to the subpolar North Atlantic. Here we observe and simulate a submesoscale (<20km) mechanism by which the Gulf Stream exchanges water with subpolar water to the north. Along isopycnals, the front has a sharp compensated temperature-salinity contrast, with distinct mixed water between the two water masses 2 and 4km wide. This mixed water does not increase downstream despite substantial energy available for mixing. A series of streamers detrain this water at the crest of meanders. Subpolar water replaces the mixed water and resharpens the front. The water mass exchange accounts for a northward flux of salt of 0.5-2.5 psum(2)s(-1), (large-scale diffusivity O (100m(2)s(-1))). This is similar to bulk-scale flux estimates of 1.2psum(2)s(-1) and supplies fresher water to the Gulf Stream required for the production of 18 degrees subtropical mode water.Show less"
2,"Abernethy, EF",,"Population connectivity of aquatic insects in a dam-regulated, desert river",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Humans have exaggerated natural habitat fragmentation, negatively impacting species dispersal and reducing population connectivity. Habitat fragmentation can be especially detrimental in freshwater populations, whose dispersal is already constrained by the river network structure. Aquatic insects, for instance, are generally limited to two primary modes of dispersal: downstream drift in the aquatic juvenile life stages and flight during the terrestrial winged adult stage. Yet the impacts of large hydropower dams can make rivers uninhabitable for incoming (drifting) juvenile insects, with remaining refugia found only in tributaries. The ability of adult aquatic insects to traverse such river stretches in search of suitable tributary habitat likely depends on factors such as species-specific dispersal ability and distance between tributaries. To explore the intersection of natural and human-induced habitat fragmentation on aquatic insect dispersal ability, we quantified population genetics of three taxa with varying dispersal abilities, a caddisfly (Hydropsychidae, Hydropsyche oslari), a mayfly (Baetidae: Fallceon quilleri), and a water strider (Veliidae: Rhagovelia distincta), throughout tributaries of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA. Using 2bRAD reduced genome sequencing and landscape genetics analyses, we revealed a strong pattern of isolation by distance among mayfly populations. This contrasts with caddisfly and water strider populations, which were largely panmictic. Analysis of thousands of informative single nucleotide polymorphisms showed that realized dispersal ability may not be accurately predicted by species traits for these widespread species. Principal components analysis revealed a strong division between caddisfly populations upstream and downstream of Havasu Creek (279 km through the 390 km study reach), suggesting that the geography of the Grand Canyon imposes a dispersal barrier for this species. Our use of genetic tools in the Grand Canyon to understand population structure has enabled us to elucidate dispersal barriers for aquatic insects. Ultimately, these data may be useful in informing effective conservation management plans for understudied organisms of conservation interest.Show less"
3,"Demetrescu, C",Dec 2009 ,Trading Off Space for Passes in Graph Streaming Problems,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ALGORITHMS,"Data stream processing has recently received increasing attention as a computational paradigm for dealing with massive data sets. Surprisingly, no algorithm with both sublinear space and passes is known for natural graph problems in classical read-only streaming. Motivated by technological factors of modern storage systems, some authors have recently started to investigate the computational power of less restrictive models where writing streams is allowed. In this article, we show that the use of intermediate temporary streams is powerful enough to provide effective space-passes tradeoffs for natural graph problems. In particular, for any space restriction of s bits, we show that single-source shortest paths in directed graphs with small positive integer edge weights can be solved in O((n log(3/2) n)/root s) passes. The result can be generalized to deal with multiple sources within the same bounds. This is the first known streaming algorithm for shortest paths in directed graphs. For undirected connectivity, we devise an O((n log n)/s) passes algorithm. Both problems require Omega(n/s) passes under the restrictions we consider. We also show that the model where intermediate temporary streams are allowed can be strictly more powerful than classical streaming for some problems, while maintaining all of its hardness for others.Show less"
4,"Baker, MA",Feb 2004 ,"Hydrological variability, organic matter supply and denitrification in the Garonne River ecosystem",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Groundwater nitrate contamination has become a worldwide problem as increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilisers are used in agriculture. Alluvial groundwater is uniquely juxtaposed between soils and streams. Hydrological connections among these subsystems regulate nutrient cycling.2. We measured denitrification using an in situ acetylene-block assay in a nitrate-contaminated portion of the Garonne River catchment along a gradient of surface water-ground water mixing during high (snowmelt) and low flow.3. During high flow (mid-April to early June) the water table rose an average of 35 cm and river water penetrated the subsurface to a great extent in monitoring wells. Denitrification rates averaged 5.40 mugN(2)O L-1 min(-1) during the high flow period, nearly double the average rate (2.91 mugN(2)O L-1 min(-1)) measured during base flow. This was driven by a strong increase in denitrification in groundwater under native riparian vegetation. Nitrate concentrations were significantly lower during high flow compared with base flow. Riparian patches had higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations that were more aromatic compared with the gravel bar patch closest to the river.4. Multiple linear regression showed that the rate of denitrification was best predicted by the concentration of low molecular weight organic acids. These molecules are probably derived from decomposition of soil organic matter and are an important energy source for anaerobic respiratory processes like denitrification. The second best predictor was per cent surface water, reflecting higher denitrification rates during spring when hydrological connection between surface water and ground water was greatest.5. Our results indicate that, while denitrification rates in Garonne River alluvium were spatially and temporally variable, denitrification was a significant NO3 sink during transport from the NO3-contaminated floodplain to the river. DOC availability and river-floodplain connectivity were important factors influencing observed spatial and temporal patterns.Show less"
5,"Liu, SD",Mar 15 2021 ,Groundwater as a limited carbon dioxide source in a large river (the Yangtze River),SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Groundwater discharge to river networks makes up a major source of riverine CO2 emission, available evidence however comes mainly from headwater streams which are directly connected to terrestrial ecosystems and spatially limited in terms of system size. Here relying on coupled water and CO2 mass balances, we quantified the groundwater-mediated CO2 input to the Yangtze River mainstem on an annual basis, where the mass balance of water provided physical constraints on CO2 exchange between the river and groundwater. A landscape topographic control of the groundwater-river interaction was proposed where mountain reaches preferentially receive water and CO2 discharge from the groundwater while plain alluvial reaches predominantly lose water to the aquifers. Groundwater CO2 inputs were however small in magnitude on all reaches (0.3-14% of the total CO2 emission and transport by the river) and unable to account for the discrepancy between surface evasion and internalmetabolismin the river. Minor direct groundwater discharge to the reaches in comparison to smaller streams (negative to < 3.5% of the surface water flows) was concluded to be the main reason for low groundwater-sourced CO2 in the large river reaches.

6,"Zhang, JH",Aug 2018 ,"Water Compensation and Its Implication of the Three Gorges Reservoir for the River-Lake System in the Middle Yangtze River, China",WATER,"Dam construction is an important means to improve water use efficiency and the aquatic environment. However, the flow regulation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in the middle Yangtze River has attracted much attention because the severe drought occurred in the river-lake system downstream of the TGR. In this paper, the Dongting Lake was selected as a case study in order to detect the possible relationship between the flow regulation of the TGR and the extreme drought in the river-lake system based on a coupled hydrodynamic model. The results not only confirmed the significant role of the TGR to relieve drought in the river-lake system, but also indicated that the outflow of the TGR and the hydraulic gradient between the Zhicheng to Chenglingji stations were the crucial factors to affect the water exchange between the rivers and the Dongting Lake. The adjustment of hydraulic gradient within a proper range during the water compensation of the TGR will be an effective measure to improve the water exchange and water environment in the river-lake system. These findings present the quantitative influence of these important factors on the water exchange between rivers and lakes and provide a scientific reference for environmental and ecological management of other river-lake systems.Show less"
7,"Dangeard, M",Oct 2021 ,River Corridor Model Constrained by Time-Lapse Seismic Acquisition,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A new hydrogeophysical approach was developed to reveal the spatial and temporal dynamic flow pathways inside a river corridor as well as the pattern of transient surface water and the groundwater (SW-GW) exchanges. Obtaining such information from traditional hydrological data remains a challenge, both in terms of accuracy and validation. As there is no direct measurement of these fluxes, estimating dynamic pathways and SW-GW exchanges is frequently tackled with the help of numerical models. Yet, the definition of initial and boundary conditions is generally based on poorly constrained assumptions and restrained to the location of piezometers, due to the lack of knowledge of the water table (WT) geometry. We provide a methodology to build stronger constraints to the numerical simulation and the hydrodynamic parameters calibration, both in space and time, by using a multi-method approach. On the Orgeval Critical Zone observatory (France), we show how a thorough interpretation of high-resolution geophysical images, combined with geotechnical data, helps to resolve subsurface structural heterogeneity. This coupling provides a detailed distribution of hydrofacies, valuable prior information about the associated hydrodynamic properties distribution. The temporal dynamic of the WT table can be locally captured with high-resolution time-lapse seismic acquisitions. Time-lapse variations are interpreted as temporal changes in the saturated-unsaturated zone continuum. Each seismic snapshot is then thoroughly inverted to image spatial WT variations. This posterior geophysical information is then used to calibrate the hydrogeological modeling domain. The use of the WT improves the estimation of transient stream-aquifer exchanges, especially during the rain event.Show less"
8,"McCreesh, RK",Sep 2019 ,"Reintroduced Beavers Rapidly Influence the Storage and Biogeochemistry of Sediments in Headwater Streams (Methow River, Washington)",NORTHWEST SCIENCE,"North American beavers (Castor canadensis) were targeted within North American headwater landscapes by European loggers and fur traders in the 19th century, reducing beaver populations to near extinction by 1900. The extirpation of beavers from river networks has had profound effects on riparian zones, including channel geomorphology, temperature regimes, sediment storage, channel-floodplain connectivity, carbon storage and nutrient dynamics. Consequently, reintroducing beavers has been provisionally implemented as a restoration approach within some watersheds. We characterized how reintroduced beavers influence the short-term dynamics of organic material accumulation within the sediments of 1st and 2nd order streams within the Methow River watershed of Washington State. In collaboration with the Methow Beaver Project, we identified four creeks where they had reintroduced beavers within the past five years, as well as a control non-beaver pond. At each site, we collected shallow sediment cores from upstream, downstream, and within beaver ponds, and then measured organic material via elemental analyses of sediment carbon (%C) and nitrogen (%N) content. We compared those samples to sediments accumulated in local pond areas not created by beaver activity. Our results show greater organic C and N content of sediments in beaver ponds than non-beaver ponds. C/N ratios indicate elevated accumulation of allochthonous organic material in beaver impoundment sediments that would otherwise not be integrated into headwater streams from the terrestrial landscape. These findings suggest that the reintroduction of beavers could be an effective means to promote restoration of whole ecosystem function.Show less"
9,"Evans, EC",Mar 30 1998 ,River energy budgets with special reference to river bed processes,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This paper uses detailed hydrometeorological data to evaluate the influence of channel bed processes on the river energy budget at an experimental site on the regulated River Blithe, Staffordshire, UK. Results from a pilot study are presented for eight days during July, September, October and November 1994.Total energy gains were dominated by net short-wave radiation (97.60%) with significant contributions from sensible heat exchange and friction (1.17 and 1.06%, respectively) and minor additions from condensation and bed conduction (0.16 and 0.01%, respectively). Net long-wave radiation, evaporation, conduction into the river bed, sensible heat transfer and the energy advected during evaporation accounted for 53.98, 23.56, 16.27, 5.25 and 0.94% of the total heat losses. On average, over 82% of the total energy transfers occurred at the air-water interface. Approximately 15% of the total energy exchanges occurred at the channel bed, but maximum daily heat exchanges accounted for up to 24% of the daily total energy transfer. The amount of short-wave radiation attenuated in the water column, and values measured at the channel bed varied considerably from those calculated using a standard coefficient. Values of bed conduction varied in response to different vertical thermal profiles in the channel bed, reflecting the variable influence of sedimentology and groundwater flux. Fluctuations in levels of periphyton and macrophyte cover were also shown to have a significant effect on energy fluxes at the channel bed. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
10,"Wohl, E",Dec 2018 ,Geomorphic context in rivers,PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT,"Geomorphic context refers to the geomorphic setting of a river reach, which is defined as a length of river with consistent valley and channel geometry. Context includes spatial dimensions of geometry, location within a drainage basin, and location within a global context. Context also includes temporal dimensions of the frequency and duration of specific processes influencing the river reach and the historical sequence of natural and human-induced processes that continue to influence process and form in the river reach. These spatial and temporal characteristics interact to create a geomorphic context that governs the contemporary form of the river corridor, the rates and processes by which diverse materials move through the corridor, and the adjustments of form and process in response to disturbances. Context matters for both basic understanding and effective management of river corridors. Examples of widely used formal articulations of geomorphic context include a bedform-based classification of mountain streams, geomorphic process domains, and river styles. Each has been applied to understanding and predicting longitudinal variations in stream power, sediment budgets, habitat and biotic communities, resilience to disturbance, and other characteristics of rivers. The three Cs of rivers-complexity (or spatial heterogeneity), connectivity, and context-provide a conceptual framework for river research and management.Show less"
11,"Lusardi, RA",Oct 2018 ,Stream macrophytes increase invertebrate production and fish habitat utilization in a California stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Stable flow and thermal regimes, coupled with geologically derived nutrients, are drivers of enhanced productivity in volcanic spring-fed rivers. However, little information exists on biotic mechanisms or species interactions contributing to elevated productivity at higher trophic levels. In a California stream, juvenile steelhead trout were observed to preferentially select macrophyte habitat at a rate three times greater, on average, than five other habitat types. To understand the potential rearing benefits associated with macrophytes, we conducted a manipulative experiment to determine how macrophytes affect invertebrate prey availability and stream water velocity. Macrophytes supported up to nine times greater abundance of invertebrates than adjacent open gravel habitats. They also doubled invertebrate drift rates and reduced water velocity by up to 42-fold. The results show that aquatic macrophytes are an important stream habitat feature that may be bioenergetically more favourable for rearing salmonids than more traditional lotic habitats. We suggest that macrophytes have the potential to enhance growth rates of juvenile salmonids when compared with other habitat types. Habitats that confer growth and size advantages may ultimately improve fitness and contribute to conservation of imperilled salmonids.Show less"

13,"Ferencz, SB",Nov 2019 ,Analysis of the Effects of Dam Release Properties and Ambient Groundwater Flow on Surface Water-Groundwater Exchange Over a 100-km-Long Reach,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydroelectric dams often create highly dynamic downstream flows that promote surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) interactions including bank storage, the temporary storage of river water in the riverbank. Previous research on SW-GW exchanges in dammed rivers has primarily been at single study sites, which has limited the understanding of how these exchanges evolve as dam releases travel downstream. This study evaluates how dam releases affect SW-GW exchange continuously over a 100-km distance. This is accomplished by longitudinally routing water releases through a synthetic river and modeling bed and bank fluid and solute exchange across transverse transects spaced along the reach. Peak and square dam release hydrograph shapes with three magnitudes (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 m) were considered. The effect of four ambient groundwater flow conditions (very slightly losing, neutral, and two gaining from the perspective of the river) was evaluated for each dam release scenario. Both types of dam release shapes cause SW-GW interaction over the entire 100-km distance, and our results show that square type releases cause bank storage exchange well beyond this distance. Strongly gaining conditions reduce the amount of exchange and allow flushing of river-sourced solute out of the bank after the dam pulse has passed. Both neutral and losing conditions have larger fluid and solute flux into the bank and limit the amount of solute that returns to the river. Our results support that river corridors downstream of dams have increased river-aquifer connectivity and that this enhanced connectivity can extend at least 100 km downstream.Show less"
14,"Valois, R",May-jun 2018 ,Characterizing Stream-Aquifer Exchanges with Self-Potential Measurements,GROUNDWATER,"Characterizing the interactions between streams and aquifers is a major challenge in hydrology. Electrical self-potential (SP) is sensitive to groundwater flow through the electrokinetic effect, which is proportional to Darcy velocity. SP surveys have been extensively used for the characterization of seepage flow in a variety of contexts. But to our knowledge, a model coupling SP and groundwater flow has never been implemented for the study of stream-aquifer interactions. To address the issue, we first implemented a two-dimensional model to a synthetic stream-aquifer cross section. Results underline the very distinct nature of SP profiles in gaining or losing stream conditions. Second, we presented a field application in a transect crossing a stream in losing conditions. The coupled model successfully reproduced the observed SP profile. This inverse modeling of the SP signal provides quantitative data on hydrodynamic parameters (hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic heads) and geophysical parameters (coupling coefficient). Nevertheless, all relevant parameters cannot be uniquely estimated without precise prior information on at least some of these parameters. Our results confirm the potential of SP surveys on the characterization of stream-aquifer exchanges. Recommendations on the collection of high-quality data are also provided, along with a description of the contexts in which the methodology is likely to perform well.Show less"
15,"Greet, J",Feb 15 2022 ,Restored river-floodplain connectivity promotes riparian tree maintenance and recruitment,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"Riparian forest loss and degradation due to river-floodplain disconnection is a global problem. Prospects for the maintenance and recruitment of riparian trees via restored flooding can be uncertain, in part due to competition from understorey vegetation and limited availability of tree propagules. In a field-based trial, we assessed the response of a keystone riparian tree to restored flooding, reduced competition and seed addition.We built diversion weirs to reconnect floodplains supporting riparian forest. Using a multiple controlintervention-reference study design with two restored flooding (intervention) sites, two naturally-engaged (reference) and two dry (control) sites, we assessed seedling recruitment of the dominant tree, Eucalyptus camphora, with and without clearance of understorey vegetation and with and without seed addition. We also assessed the growth of extant trees using dendrometers and seedfall using funnel traps at all six sites.Our weirs resulted in extensive flooding of the adjacent floodplain, while control sites remained dry. Flooding increased seed germination, seedling establishment, tree growth and seedfall. However, seed germination benefits were only realised where understorey vegetation was cleared and seed was added. Seedling establishment was also limited by dry summer conditions, except where flooding duration was longest (similar to 6 months cf. < 3 months).Restored flooding via river-floodplain reconnection is likely to promote the rehabilitation of riparian forests degraded by flow regulation or stream modification through benefits at multiple tree life-history stages. However, widespread tree recruitment may require complementary works that reduce competition via clearing of understorey vegetation and alleviate seed limitation by direct seeding or planting.Show less"
16,"Ren, J",2021 ,A Comparison of Su and Lu Modeling of Hydro-Thermal Coupling Model Using Field Temperature Records,POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,"The transport of materials and energy between rivers and riparian zones are driven by lateral hyporheic exchange and plays a vital role in regulating the ecological health of rivers. Owing to the limitations of models and methods, prior research has mainly focused on vertical hyporheic exchange in river systems. Combined with the collected riparian zone temperature and water level data, a 2D hydrothermal coupling model of the riparian zone was developed using the thermal conductivity model, and the fitting effects of the Lu et al. (2007) model and Su et al. (2016) model on temperature variations in riparian zone comparatively analyzed. Then, the dynamic variation characteristics of the riparian zone temperature and the lateral hyporheic exchange recharge pattern were investigated by the constructed models. The calibrated model could reasonably illustrate the variations in the riparian zone temperature, and the sensitivity analysis revealed that the hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is the most sensitive factor to the temperature variations.Show less"

Changes to land use may disrupt stream nutrient and geomorphological processes and reduce water quality, increase sedimentation, and decrease habitat heterogeneity eventually leading to species loss and decreases in ecosystem productivity. Endemic species are frequently at greater risk of habitat-mediated fragmentation and extirpation due to their constrained distributions.The Kanawha darter (Etheostoma kanawhae) is an understudied fish endemic to the New River Drainage in North Carolina and Virginia, USA. To investigate the potential effect(s) of land-use change on Kanawha darters, naive occupancy was modelled using instream habitat characteristics and upstream forest cover.Generalized linear models revealed that instream habitat and forest cover are reliable predictors of Kanawha darter site occupancy. Specifically, models demonstrated that occupancy increased in reaches with reduced stream width, velocity, and bedrock substrate but higher concentrations of coarse woody material. Kanawha darter occupancy was also positively associated with the extent of forest cover in upstream catchments.Although Kanawha darters are not currently considered imperilled, most populations occurred in isolated reaches separated by large sections of unoccupied habitat. Continuing ex-urban development in riparian zones is likely to be the primary threat to Kanawha darters and other endemic species in this catchment. Resource managers and stakeholders should preserve forest cover in headwaters and occupied tributaries and protect or restore riparian zones along the main-stem South and North Forks of the New River to preserve high-quality habitat and enhance connectivity among isolated Kanawha darter populations.As human populations in montane regions continue to grow, there is a need to understand how land-use change affects endemic freshwater species. This study further supports the importance of retaining forest cover as an effective strategy for protecting and restoring populations of endemic fishes in high-gradient streams.Show less"

19,"Naganna, SR",Nov 2017 ,Factors influencing streambed hydraulic conductivity and their implications on stream-aquifer interaction: a conceptual review,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"The estimation and modeling of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) is an emerging interest due to its connection to water quality, aquatic habitat, and groundwater recharge. Existing research has found ways to sample and measure K at specific sites and with laboratory tests. The challenge undertaken was to review progress, relevance, complexity in understanding and modeling via statistical and geostatistical approaches, literature gaps, and suggestions toward future needs. This article provides an overview of factors and processes influencing streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) and its role in the stream-aquifer interaction. During our synthesis, we discuss the influence of geological, hydrological, biological, and anthropogenic factors that lead to variability of streambed substrates. Literature examples document findings to specific sites that help to portray the role of streambed K and other interrelated factors in the modeling of hyporheic and groundwater flow systems. However, studies utilizing an integrated, comprehensive database are limited, restricting the ability of broader application and understanding. Examples of in situ and laboratory methods of estimating hydraulic conductivity suggest challenges in acquiring representative samples and comparing results, considering the anisotropy and heterogeneity of fluvial bed materials and geohydrological conditions. Arriving at realistic statistical and spatial inference based on field and lab data collected is challenging, considering the possible sediment sources, processes, and complexity. Recognizing that the K for a given particle size group includes several to many orders of magnitude, modeling of streambed K and groundwater interaction remain conceptual and experimental. Advanced geostatistical techniques offer a wide range of univariate or multi-variate interpolation procedures such as kriging and variogram analysis that can be applied to these complex systems. Research available from various studies has been instrumental in developing sampling options, recognizing the significance of fluvial dynamics, the potential for filtration, transfer, and storage of high-quality groundwater, and importance to aquatic habitat and refuge during extreme conditions. Efforts in the characterization of natural and anthropogenic conditions, substrate materials, sediment loading, colmation, and other details highlight the great complexity and perhaps need for a database to compile relevant data. The effects on streambed hydraulic conductivity due to anthropogenic disturbances (in-stream gravel mining, contaminant release, benthic activity, etc.) are the areas that still need focus. An interdisciplinary (hydro-geo-biological) approach may be necessary to characterize the magnitude and variability of streambed K and fluxes at local, regional scales.Show less"
20,"Milt, AW",Jun 2017 ,LOCAL-SCALE BENEFITS OF RIVER CONNECTIVITY RESTORATION PLANNING BEYOND JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Conservation planning aims to optimize outcomes for select species or ecosystems by directing resources toward high-return sites. The possibility that local benefits might be increased by directing resources beyond the focal area is rarely considered. We present a case study of restoring river connectivity for migratory fish of the Great Lakes Basin by removing dams and road crossings within municipal jurisdictions versus their broader watersheds. We found that greater river connectivity could often be achieved by considering both intra-jurisdictional and extra-jurisdictional barriers. Focusing on jurisdictional barriers alone generally forfeited <20% (median = 0%) of habitat gains for those who value solely habitat gains within the jurisdiction, but > 75% (median = 100%) for planners who value larger-scale habitat gains. Similarly, cost savings tended to be between -50% and +50%, but in some cases were very negative. Our study underscores the local-scale benefits of broadening restoration investments, especially for decision makers of the Great Lakes Basin and contributes to a discussion of appropriate and efficient scales of conservation planning.

21,"Ortiz-Rodriguez, AJ",Oct 2017 ,Flow connectivity in active volcanic areas: Use of index of connectivity in the assessment of lateral flow contribution to main streams,CATENA,"Connectivity analysis is an important geomorphological and hydrologic tool that can be used to identify spaces that are prone to removal of primary sediments which are eventually assimilated into granular flows and related epiclastic processes. Studies of connectivity have been made in various areas, but to date, not in active volcanic areas, where such studies can be very useful due to the constant presence of loose volcanic material easily removed by epiclastic processes. Mobilization of loose pyroclastic sediments can trigger phenomena such as lahars, which are among the most dangerous in nature.In this study, the index of connectivity (IC) (Borselli et al. 2008) was calculated by obtaining a weight coefficient (W) combining two elements: the coefficient C related to the universal soil loss equation and the revised universal soil loss equation (USLE-RUSLE) proposed by Borselli et al. (2008) for areas with vegetation cover or crops, and the roughness index (RI) developed by Cavalli et al. (2013), which characterizes bare soil areas. Combining both methods, we propose a new joint index of connectivity (ICJ) that does not overestimate the degree of connectivity in bare areas, while areas with vegetation cover are characterized based on their well recognized hydrologic impedance properties. This methodology may enable better characterization in highly dynamic environments such as active volcanic areas.We also propose a new lateral hydrological efficiency index (LHEI) that increases the ability to identify watersheds that supply major amounts of sediment to main streams in ravines.The application of this methodology in the active volcanic area of Volcan de Colima, the most active volcano in Mexico, is of great importance, because of the constant supply of new pyroclastic material from the top of the edifice, the high dynamicity of geomorphological processes, and the widespread presence of bare soil areas consisting of loose materials easily sourced, or assimilated, into epiclastic processes.Show less"
22,"Chelgren, ND",Jul 2015 ,Connectivity and conditional models of access and abundance of species in stream networks,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Barriers to passage of aquatic organisms at stream road crossings are a major cause of habitat fragmentation in stream networks. Accordingly, large investments have been made to restore passage at these crossings, but often without estimation of population-level benefits. Here, we describe a broad-scale approach to quantifying the effectiveness of passage restoration in terms interpretable at population levels, namely numbers of fish and length of stream gained through restoration, by sampling abundance in a study design that accounts for variable biogeographic species pools, variable stream and barrier configurations, and variable probabilities of capture and detectability for multiple species. We modified an existing zero-inflated negative-binomial model to estimate the probability of site access, abundance conditional on access, and capture probability of individual fish. Therein, we modeled probability of access as a function of gradient, stream road-crossing type, and downstream access by fish simultaneously with a predictive model for abundance at sites accessible to fish. Results indicated that replacement of barriers with new crossing designs intended to allow for greater movement was associated with dramatically higher probability of access for all fishes, including migratory Pacific salmon, trout, sculpin, and lamprey. Conversely, existing non-replaced crossings negatively impacted fish distributions. Assuming no downstream constraints on access, we estimated the potential length of stream restored by the program ranged between 7.33 (lamprey) and 15.28 km (small coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout). These contributions represented a fraction of the total length available upstream (187 km) of replaced crossings. When limited ranges of species were considered, the estimated contributions of culvert replacement were reduced (1.65-km range for longnose dace to 12.31 km for small coastal cutthroat and rainbow trout). Numbers of fish contributed ranged from less than 500 (longnose dace) to greater than 100000 (sculpin). Although our framework can address the question of effectiveness in a broad array of stream and crossing configurations, much stronger inferences would be possible if future restoration efforts were designed to address the limitations we encountered in this study, particularly the lack of available information on crossings and species presence prior to restoration, and nonrandom selection of crossings to be replaced.Show less"

The new model was tested in a mountain river within the New York City drinking water supply area (Sawmill, SM, Creek), and then used for base case and restoration scenarios on the 17.5 km reach of the Los Angeles (LA) River where a multi-million dollar riverine restoration project is planned. The model simulated the LA River average temperature in the base case decreased from 29.5 degrees C by 0.3 degrees C when warm surface inflows were converted to cooler groundwater inflows by terrestrial green infrastructure; by 0.7 degrees C when subsurface hyporheic exchange was increased by removal of armoring and installation of riffle-pool bedforms; by 3.6 degrees C when riparian forests shaded the river; and by 6.4 degrees C when floodplain forests were added to riparian forests to cool surface reservoirs and local air temperatures. Applying all four restoration treatments lowered river temperature by 7.2 degrees C. The simulated decreases in river temperature lead to increased saturated dissolved oxygen levels, reaching 8.7 mg/L, up from the 7.6 mg/L in the base case scenario, providing improved fish habitat and reducing eutrophication and hypoxic zones. This study evaluating the performance of environmental management scenarios could help managers control the thermal pollution in rivers.Show less"
25,"Jiang, T",Nov 2016 ,"A Possible Connectivity among Estuarine Tapertail Anchovy (Coilia nasus) Populations in the Yangtze River, Yellow Sea, and Poyang Lake",ESTUARIES AND COASTS,"Estuarine tapertail anchovy (Coilia nasus) is a highly commercial and valuable anadromous fish species in China. Due to the complex anadromous life cycle, it remains difficult to assess the degree of connectivity among groups of C. nasus in the Yangtze River, its connecting lakes, and adjacent seas. In this study, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) was used to analyze the element composition in the otolith nucleus region of C. nasus specimens from the Yangtze River Estuary, Poyang Lake, and Nantong coastal waters in the estuary adjacent to the Yellow Sea. The content ratios of seven elements (Na, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Sr, and Ba) to Ca in the nucleus indicated a close relationship among C. nasus specimens collected from the Yangtze River Estuary (Spring group), Poyang Lake, and Yellow Sea, suggesting a possible connectivity mechanism for anchovies in the three water bodies. Poyang Lake, Yangtze River, and Yellow Sea seem to be the natal lake, migration pathway, and feeding ground, respectively.Show less"
26,"Fisher, SG",Sep 2004 ,Horizons in stream biogeochemistry: Flowpaths to progress,ECOLOGY,"Over the past 50 years, conceptual developments in stream ecology and ecosystem ecology have converged, thanks to biogeochemistry and the recognition that in situ processing on one hand and spatial translation of materials, processes, and influence along flowpaths on the other, unite to generate a holistic picture of ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. Early emphases in stream biogeochemistry involved organic carbon dynamics and whole-ecosystem budgets. These approaches were holistic but cumbersome and laborious and ignored several crucial issues, such as variation in organic matter quality. Nutrient-spiraling approaches rectified this shortcoming and provided a flowpath-specific technique for resolving the dynamics of both inorganic and organic materials and for comparing streams of different sizes and flow rates. The ability of nutrient-spiraling approaches to deal with multiple elements and fluctuating flows, including floods, remains elusive, however.There are several opportunities for stream ecology and biogeochemistry to continue cross-fertilization to the benefit of both disciplines. Chief among these is an emphasis on streams as spatially distributed heterogeneous systems, constantly shifting in shape and configuration through time. Hydrologic and material flowpaths integrate this heterogeneity as they alternately converge and diverge and perfuse the channel, hyporheic zone, riparian zone, and floodplain as they transport materials inexorably downstream. Conceptualizing streams as branched structures adds new insights to biogeochemical processing in space and raises several questions about network shape as an independent variable influencing biogeochemical dynamics such as nutrient retention efficiency. Junctions of streams emerge as potentially significant functional units when streams are viewed as networks. Ultimately, stream drainages finely dissect the land and receive water from soils in channelless upland regions which are themselves pervaded by convergent flowpaths, thus blurring the difference between streams and the landscapes they drain.Other lucrative future research opportunities are discussed including a plea for greater use of stoichiometric approaches and a consideration of geometry, disturbance, and legacies at multiple scales of space and time. We predict that future research in biogeochemistry will increasingly seek and find similarities among diverse ecosystem types by focusing on the spatially explicit flowpaths that integrate and connect them.Show less"
27,"Lopez-Vicente, M",May 2017 ,Hydrological Connectivity Does Change Over 70Years of Abandonment and Afforestation in the Spanish Pyrenees,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,"Runoff connectivity depends on topography, rainfall, man-made elements (terraces, trails, roads and drainage systems) and vegetation. In this study, we quantified the effects of 70years of human activities on runoff connectivity in the mountainous Araguas afforested sub-catchment (172ha; Central Spanish Pyrenees). The IC index of hydrological connectivity was chosen to perform this metric over six land use scenarios at high spatial resolution (1x1m of cell size). The current scenario (year 2012) was simulated with three flow accumulation algorithms (MD, MD8 and D8). MD8 was linked with the most frequent hydrological response of the sub-catchment (rainfall intensity and stream flow during 7years) and generated the most representative pattern of connectivity, especially in the linear landscape elements (LLE). This algorithm was chosen to simulate five past scenarios (1945, 1956, 1973, 1980 and 2006). In all scenarios, the highest connectivity appeared related to trails and roads, as well as to streams and gullies, whereas the lowest appeared related to stonewalls in 1945 and 1956 to hillslopes in 1973, and the following afforestation. Changes in connectivity mainly depended on the changes in the vegetation factor and in a minor way in the total length, spatial location and type of LLE. Afforestation promoted lower and more stable connectivity at both local and catchment scales. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"
28,"Sjodin, A",Mar 2001 ,Analysis of groundwater exchange for a large plains river in Colorado (USA),HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Complete daily water budget information was assembled for a 105 km segment. of the South Platte River in the plains region below Denver, CO, for the period 1983-1993. The data were used in testing the possibility that dependence of alluvial exchange mechanisms on stage height, as shown by models of alluvial exchange, allows alluvial exchange to be predicted continuously over a given reach through use of statistical information on river discharge. The study segment was divided into an upper and a lower reach; daily alluvial exchanges for each reach were estimated by the method of residuals. The two reaches show small (15%) but statistically significant annual differences in rates of exchange. For each reach, there is a seasonal pattern (2 .5-fold oscillation) in alluvial discharge to the channel, reflecting seasonality in recharge of the alluvium by irrigation. At discharges up to 40 m(3)/s (82nd percentile), alluvial discharge to the channel occurs at a rate independent of river discharge. Above 40 m(3)/s, net alluvial discharge into the channel is progressively reduced; at 60 m(3)/s (92nd percentile) there is no net alluvial exchange. At still higher river discharges, water is lost to the alluvium through bank storage at a rate that is linearly related to the logarithm of discharge. Annually, alluvial discharge accounts for 15-18% of water entering the study segment, and alluvial recharge through bank storage accounts for 2-48 of water leaving the segment. Alluvial recharge through bank storage at the highest discharges can, however, exceed low-flow alluvial discharge rates by five-fold over short intervals. Even though daily alluvial exchanges vary widely, they can be estimated at r(2) values above 80% on the basis of reach, season, and river discharge.

29,"Attal, M",Jun 2006 ,New facility to study river abrasion processes,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING,"This technical note presents a new facility which was constructed in order to study sediment and bedrock abrasion processes during fluvial transport. These processes exert an important control on long-term landscape evolution but they are still poorly understood and inadequately quantified. The proposed experimental device is an annular flume with four fluid injections coupled to a close water circuit and a powerful pump, in order to reach hydrodynamic conditions up to whose prevailing in mountain streams. Fluid surface geometry and visualization experiments with a high speed camera allow us to monitor hydrodynamic variables and sediment motion during the experiments. Despite the circular geometry of the flume, pebble trajectories are found to closely mimic the bedload behavior in straight flume. Based also on a direct comparison with pebble abrasion rates along a large Himalayan River, we hypothesize that our device simulates in a realistic way transport processes and consequently abrasion processes in mountain rivers.Show less"
30,"Zhang, YH",Mar 2022 ,Effects of roots systems on hydrological connectivity below the soil surface in the Yellow River Delta wetland,ECOHYDROLOGY,"In this study, a new method based on field dye-tracing experiments was used to assess hydrological connectivity below the soil surface. In this method, Phragmites australis in the Yellow River Delta wetland was considered to characterize the interaction between roots systems and hydrological connectivity. The results showed that index of hydrological connectivity (IHC) declined non-linearly with depth below the soil surface. Roots systems of P. australis were mostly distributed in soils of 0-30 cm. Roots systems parameters (root length, root width, root surface area, root projected area, root volume and root biomass) were positively correlated with IHC. Coarse roots systems (3 < D < 5 mm) made the highest contribution to the changes of IHC. This study provided suggestions for wetland management in the study area: (1) Reeds should not be reaped every year to promote the litters decomposition for roots nutrition availability; and (2) freshwater inputs should be strengthened in the initial/middle growth stage of reeds to improve roots architecture. Knowledge about the interaction between roots systems and hydrological connectivity below the soil surface is crucial for large-scale wetland protection as wetland managers regulate the control and distribution of vegetation.Show less"
31,"Mori, T",Oct 2018 ,Turbid water induces refuge behaviour of a commercially important ayu: A field experiment for interstream movement using multiple artificial streams,ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,"Riverine systems are inherently dendritic in nature, and turbid water may not necessarily flow equally throughout an entire catchment. Tributaries have the potential to serve as refugia from temporarily turbid water in the main stem. As ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) are one of the important species for the inland fisheries industry and recreational fishing, their behaviour in a branched river network is a primary concern. We released ayu with radio-transmitting tags into two experimental streams that joined at a downstream pool. Turbid water was released into one of the streams, and we identified whether avoidance movement of ayu between the two experimental streams was triggered by flowing turbid water. The suspended solid concentration elevated rapidly after adding the turbid water and was maintained at more than 400mg/L for 3hr. Avoidance movement of ayu was triggered when the suspended solid concentration exceeded approximately 200mg/L. Then, most ayu moved from the turbid stream to the nonturbid one, leading to a difference in ayu density between the two streams. Therefore, we demonstrated that turbid water induced interstream movement of a commercially important ayu as refuge behaviour, suggesting that river connectivity is important for the persistence of the ayu.Show less"

We established the Integrated Accessibility Index to Marine and Freshwater (IAIMF) to evaluate the hydrological connectivity based on the accessibility principles. 1 km grid was setup for quantifying spatially the grid based hydrological connectivity within the interaction zone of the freshwater and marine water in the Yellow River Estuary of China. The results demonstrated that: 1) IAIMF indicated a gradually changed hydrological connectivity from the freshwater dominative area to marine dominative area, which presented quantitatively the detailed spatial characteristics of the hydrological connectivity in the study area. 2) The correlation coefficient between the soil salinity data and IAIMF reached 0.694, demonstrating that IAIMF is reasonable to quantify the hydrological connectivity in the estuary area. 3) IAIMF played a good role for indicating the vegetation partition of marine-freshwater. IAIMF revealed a linkage between the spatial distribution of coastal wetland vegetation with environmental characteristics of creeks and soil salinity. Due to its presenting the key information of water accessibility to the wetland habitat, IAIMF can provide more effective and scientific schemes for decision makers on the costal wetland restoration and biodiversity conservation.Show less"
33,"Coluccio, K",Oct 29 2019 ,A review of methods for measuring groundwater-surface water exchange in braided rivers,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Braided rivers, while uncommon internationally, are significant in terms of their unique ecosystems and as vital freshwater resources at locations where they occur. With an increasing awareness of the connected nature of surface water and groundwater, there have been many studies examining groundwater-surface water exchange in various types of waterbodies, but significantly less research has been conducted in braided rivers. Thus, there is currently limited understanding of how characteristics unique to braided rivers, such as channel shifting, expanding and narrowing margins, and a high degree of heterogeneity affect groundwater-surface water flow paths. This article provides an overview of characteristics specific to braided rivers, including a map showing the regions where braided rivers are mainly found at the global scale: Alaska, Canada, the Japanese and European Alps, the Himalayas, Russia, and New Zealand. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first map of its kind. This is followed by a review of prior studies that have investigated groundwater-surface water interactions in braided rivers and their associated aquifers. The various methods used to characterise these processes are discussed with emphasis on their effectiveness in achieving the studies' objectives and their applicability in braided rivers. We also discuss additional methods that appear promising to apply in braided river settings. The aim is to provide guidance on methodologies most suitable for future work in braided rivers. In many cases, previous studies found a multi-method approach useful to produce more robust results and compare data collected at various scales. Given the challenges of working directly in braided rivers, there is considerable scope for the increased use of remote sensing techniques. There is also opportunity for new approaches to modelling braided rivers using integrated techniques that incorporate the complex river bed terrain and geomorphology of braided rivers explicitly. We also identify a critical need to improve the conceptual understanding of hyporheic exchange in braided rivers, rates of recharge to and from braided rivers, and historical patterns of dry and low-flow periods in these rivers.Show less"
34,"Foubert, A",May 2020 ,"How intensive agricultural practices and flow regulation are threatening fish spawning habitats and their connectivity in the St. Lawrence River floodplain, Canada",LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,"Context Hydrological and land use changes for human purposes, have resulted in the increased fragmentation of river landscapes and the loss of aquatic habitats, leading to profound changes in fish diversity and productivity. Objectives In the fluvial Lake Saint-Pierre (St. Lawrence River, Canada), we studied how agricultural practices and water-flow regulation have impacted the area and connectivity of spawning habitats of northern pike (Esox lucius). Methods Northern pike spawning and nursery habitats were modelled over a 49-year period (1965-2013) to estimate effective spawning area under four contrasting hydrological conditions. Results Simulations coupled with land cover analyses revealed that natural flow conditions historically favourable for fish reproduction (high and stable water flows) have been lost due to human activities. The highest potential for reproduction and habitat connectivity have been lost due to (1) intensive agriculture and ploughing of natural vegetation in the upper floodplain that overlaps suitable spawning areas for northern pike, and (2) flow regulation that has lowered and shortened spring floods and dried spawning grounds more frequently. Conclusions To restore the St. Lawrence River functions, we propose to reconvert the portion of the floodplains that is vital to fish, but is currently used by intensive agriculture, into natural wetlands or perennial crops and to restore a more natural flow regime by extending the duration of floods between spawning and nursery periods. The highest priority for habitat restoration should target the most effective and recurrent spawning habitats, ditch and stream networks, and connected managed wetlands.Show less"

However, the mechanism between hydrological connectivity and water-related environment has not been revealed completely. To address these issues, we use a landscape connectivity approach to assess the connectivity of water patches for analyzing the hydrological connectivity of the Bosten Lake Basin (BLB), as well as its response to human activities and climate change, based on the Joint Research Centre (JRC) global surface water dataset. It shows that the integral index of connectivity (IIC) of the BLB is low (ranging from 0 to 0.2) from 1990 to 2019, with an increasing interannual trend. The connectivity is higher in wet periods and in oases compared with dry periods and high-altitude mountain regions. Correlation and regression analyses indicate that hydrological connectivity has a strong correlation (r > 0.5, p <= 0.05) with water area and water level. The interannual and seasonal trends of eight hydrochemical indices in the Bosten Lake have been investigated to systematically elaborate the complex relationships between hydrological connectivity and water quality in the BLB. Results indicated that better hydrological connectivity can improve water quality, and the minimum of pollutants were observed in high hydrological connectivity period, covering approximately 75% of the high-water quality period. These findings could provide scientific support for the water management in the BLB.Show less"

Eleven patch types were plotted on three land cover types representing broad ecological niches with different moisture regimes for four time periods. The river's simultaneous decrease in sinuosity, which underscores the loss of the landscape's ecohydrological connectivity, was quanified. The results show that long-term human-dominated land use worked in concert with a naturally occuring seasonal flood regime. The findings strongly indicate that high human density and intensive exploitation can co-exist with a functioning floodplain. Landscape change was interpreted by using a new concept, that of the place-name patch, which can be universally applied to interpret historical land use changes in river basins. Our method is reproducible in river basins with a history of intensive human use.Show less"

38,"Chen, K",2022 ,A Two-Stream Graph Convolutional Network Based on Brain Connectivity for Anesthetized States Analysis,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING,"Investigating neural mechanisms of anesthesia process and developing efficient anesthetized state detection methods are especially on high demand for clinical consciousness monitoring. Traditional anesthesia monitoring methods are not involved with the topological changes between electrodes covering the prefrontal-parietal cortices, by investigating electrocorticography (ECoG). To fill this gap, a framework based on the two-stream graph convolutional network (GCN) was proposed, i.e., one stream for extracting topological structure features, and the other one for extracting node features. The two-stream graph convolutional network includes GCN Model 1 and GCN Model 2. For GCN Model 1, brain connectivity networks were constructed by using phase lag index (PLI), representing different structure features. A common adjacency matrix was founded through the dual-graph method, the structure features were expressed on nodes. Therefore, the traditional spectral graph convolutional network can be directly applied on the graphs with changing topological structures. On the other hand, the average of the absolute signal amplitudes was calculated as node features, then a fully connected matrix was constructed as the adjacency matrix of these node features, as the input of GCN Model 2. This method learns features of both topological structure and nodes of the graph, and uses a dual-graph approach to enhance the focus on topological structure features. Based on the ECoG signals of monkeys, results show that this method which can distinguish awake state, moderate sedation and deep sedation achieved an accuracy of 92.75% in group-level experiments and mean accuracy of 93.50% in subject-level experiments. Our work verifies the excellence of the graph convolutional network in anesthesia monitoring, the high recognition accuracy also shows that the brain network may carry neurological markers associated with anesthesia.Show less"
39,"Liu, XM",Jan 1 2015 ,Processes controlling delta Li-7 in rivers illuminated by study of streams and groundwaters draining basalts,EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS,"We evaluate the factors influencing the abundance, [Li], and isotopic composition of riverine Li delivered to the oceans through analyses and modeling of [Li] and delta Li-7 in streams and groundwaters draining a single continental lithology, the Columbia River Basalts (CRBs). The streams were sampled in different climate zones that lie east (dry), and west (wet) of the Cascades Mountains, and during two different seasons (summer and late winter) in order to evaluate climatic and seasonal influences on Li isotopes in rivers. Dissolved Li (delta Li-7(dis) = +9.3 to +30.4) is systematically heavier than that of fresh or weathered CRBs (-4.7 to +6.0, Liu et al., 2013), suspended loads (-5.9 to -0.3), and shallow groundwaters (+6.7 to +9.4), consistent with previous studies showing that Li isotope fractionation is affected by equilibration between stream water and secondary minerals. However, the lack of correlation between delta Li-7(dis) and climate zone, the uniform secondary minerals and bedrock, coupled with the highly variable (>20 parts per thousand) delta Li-7(dis) indicate that other factors exert a strong control on delta Li-7(dis). In particular, the heavier Li in streams compared to the shallow groundwaters that feed them indicates that continued isotopic fractionation between stream water and suspended and/or bed loads has a major influence on riverine delta Li-7. Seasonal delta Li-7 variation is observed only for streams west of the Cascades, where the difference in precipitation rate between the dry and wet seasons is greatest. Reactive transport model simulations reveal that riverine delta Li-7 is strongly controlled by subsurface residence times and the Li isotope fractionation occurring within rivers. The latter explains why there is no positive correlation between delta Li-7 and traditional weathering proxies such as Si or normalized Si in rivers, as riverine Li isotope fractionation drives delta Li-7 to higher values during transport, whereas the concentrations of major cations and anions are diluted. The varying residence time for groundwaters feeding the western streams in summer (long residence times, higher delta Li-7, greater weathering) and winter (short residence times, lower delta Li-7, less weathering) explains the observed seasonal variations. A global, negative correlation between delta Li-7 and Li/Na for streams and rivers draining basaltic catchments reflects the overall transport time, hence the amount of silicate weathering. Based on our results, the increase of delta Li-7 in seawater during the Cenozoic is unlikely related to changing climate, but may reflect mountain building giving rise to increased silicate weathering.

These insects inhabit saturated interstitial areas below the riverbed (hyporheic zone) at the larval stage, mate in terrestrial habitats, and return to rivers for oviposition, but there is no knowledge concerning their dispersal characteristics. We sought to address this by examining how far amphibitic insects disperse away from the channel (laterally) and along upstream or downstream (longitudinally) in a gravel-bed river. Alloperla ishikariana was selected as the focal species because it numerically dominates other amphibites in an 18-km study segment of a 4th-order gravel-bed river in Hokkaido, Northern Japan. Malaise traps were set at various distances from the channel towards the riparian forest to estimate lateral dispersal distances. An elevated stable nitrogen isotope ratio in downstream larvae, caused by the influence of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant, was used to assess longitudinal dispersal by identifying and tracking adult movements. Laterally, 50th and 90th percentile dispersal distances were 11.66 and 35.09 m for female A. ishikariana and 20.59 and 59.20 m for male, respectively; this overlapped with distances previously estimated for other aquatic benthic taxa. Longitudinally, 50th and 90th percentile dispersal distances were 0.74 and 1.43 km for female and 3.11 and 7.87 km for male, respectively. Alloperla ishikariana had one of the longest upstream traveling distances compared with other aquatic insects, and the longest among Plecoptera taxa known thus far where male exhibited a greater dispersal distance. A higher number of adults demonstrated upstream movement, suggesting an upstream bias in the longitudinal dispersal of A. ishikariana. Overall, amphibitic stoneflies did not exhibit distinct dispersal characteristics compared with the results of previous reports on presumably benthic taxa. Our findings support an improved visualization of a multi-dimensionally connected river ecosystem in terms of material flow, including vertical connectivity.Show less"
42,"Celestino, LF",Mar 2019 ,Bidirectional connectivity via fish ladders in a large Neotropical river,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The conservation of migratory fish species worldwide has been threatened by the loss of longitudinal connectivity caused by dams intercepting large rivers. One environmental management strategy for reestablishing connectivity is providing passage through fish ladders. However, ladders in Neotropical rivers have been described as ascending one-way routes. We analysed the movements of Prochilodus lineatus through a fish ladder at a large dam-Porto Primavera-in the heavily impounded Upper Parana River, Brazil, to determine whether the ladder connected habitats downstream and upstream of the dam, in both directions. A total of 1,419 specimens of P. lineatus were PIT-tagged above and below the dam, and continuously monitored for 4 years. We documented bidirectional movements of P. lineatus through the fish ladder. Many individuals repeated these movements annually; one individual as many as six times. It was estimated that the cumulative probability that P. lineatus would return from downstream after descending through the ladder was 0.38, 0.50, and 0.56 in 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Correspondingly, return probabilities from upstream were 0.15, 0.22, and 0.26 in 1-3 years, respectively. Although return probabilities from upstream were roughly half, our results suggest the Porto Primavera fish ladder contributes to habitat connectivity, bidirectional passage, and preservation of P. lineatus. These results deviate from the perception that fishways are ineffective in Neotropical rivers. We suggest that fishways can restore the bidirectional connectivity denied to some Neotropical species, and until the services of dams are no longer needed, environmental management through fish ladders could continue to be considered as an integral part of broader conservation strategy designed to preserve native fauna.Show less"
43,"Radinger, J",Feb 15 2018 ,Improved river continuity facilitates fishes' abilities to track future environmental changes,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Barriers represent one of the largest anthropogenic impacts on the ecological status of rivers, and they also potentially restrict fishes' ability to respond to future environmental changes. Thus, river management aims to restore the longitudinal connectivity of rivers to allow continuous migration and movement of water, sediments and biota. However, it is often unclear whether the targeted barriers are also those most relevant for fish species, particularly to track future habitat shifts caused by environmental change.In this study, we applied species distribution models and the GIS-based fish dispersal model FIDIMO to evaluate the impacts of barriers (e.g. weirs and dams) on the dispersal of 17 native fish species in the European River Elbe with a particular focus on climate- and land use-induced habitat shifts. Specifically, we compared three scenarios of longitudinal connectivity: (i) current longitudinal connectivity, (ii) connectivity improvements as planned by river managers for 2021 and (iii) a reference with full longitudinal connectivity.The models indicated that barriers restricted the movement of two modeled fish species on average, thus impeding fishes' abilities to track future habitat shifts. Moreover, the number of species affected by barriers increased downstream. For the River Elbe, our results suggest that river management has most likely identified the most relevant barriers in respect to the modeled species and future environmental change. We emphasize that river management and barrier prioritization must thoroughly consider species-specific movement and dispersal abilities, as well as the specific spatial arrangement of barriers in the river system in relation to the spatial distribution of species' populations and suitable habitats.

Six synoptic surveys, two before, two during, and two after the 2002 monsoon season, encompassed periods of both low and high stream discharge. Chloride concentrations and delta O-18 values during low-flow periods indicated the river was divided into three hydrologically distinct reaches each roughly 30 km long. Upper and lower reaches were characterized by areas of localized groundwater input followed by downstream evapo-concentration gradients, limited downstream solute transport, and highly variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. In contrast, the middle reach was characterized by widespread groundwater input, continuous downstream hydrologic connectivity, and less variable carbon and nitrogen concentrations. During the monsoon season, base flow discharge increased five-to ten-fold, dissolved organic matter and inorganic N increased two- to ten-fold, Fluorescence Index (FI) values indicated a large input of terrestrial solutes, and both chloride concentrations and delta O-18 values indicated that stream water and alluvial groundwater were well mixed along the entire 95 km reach. Concurrently, the middle reach that exhibited continuous hydrologic connectivity during the nonmonsoon season was a net sink for N, while the reaches characterized by limited hydrologic connectivity during the low-flow season exhibited net N export. Our data suggest that instream biogeochemical cycling during the monsoon season is influenced by antecedent conditions, specifically hydrologic connectivity, during the dry season.Show less"

Watershed-scale hydrological models commonly simplify the sedimentology and stratigraphy of floodplains, neglecting natural floodplain heterogeneity and anisotropy. This study, conducted in the upper reach of the East River in the East River Basin, Colorado, USA, combines point-, meander-, and floodplain-scale data to determine key features of alluvial aquifers important for estimating hydrologic processes. We compare stratigraphy of two meanders with disparate geometries to explore floodplain heterogeneity and connectivity controls on flow and transport. Meander shape, orientation, and internal stratigraphy affected residence time estimates of laterally exchanged hyporheic water. Although the two meanders share a sediment source, vegetation, and climate, their divergent river migration histories resulted in contrasting meander hydrofacies. In turn, the extent and orientation of these elements controlled the effective hydraulic conductivity and, ultimately, estimates of groundwater transport and hyporheic residence times. Additionally, the meanders' orientation relative to the valley gradient impacted the hydraulic gradient across the meanders-a key control of groundwater velocity. Lastly, we combine our field data with remotely sensed data and introduce a potential approach to estimate key hydrostratigraphic packages across floodplains. Prospective applications include contaminant transport studies, hyporheic models, and watershed models. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Show less"

Mortality was monitored in 2 age classes of oysters deployed in early spring at 39 sites spread over a 37 km(2) surface area inside and outside of shellfish farms. Environmental data obtained from numerical modelling were used to investigate risk factors. Mortality of young oysters associated with ostreid herpesvirus occurred in the oyster farming area. Hydrodynamic connectivity with oyster farms was associated with higher mortality risk, whereas chlorophyll a concentration was associated with a lower risk. Adult oysters experienced 2 mortality events that were associated with different risk factors. The first event, which occurred after deployment and was probably caused by endogenous pathogens, was mainly associated with connectivity to channel rivers and salinity. The second mortality event observed at the end of the summer was mainly associated with connectivity to oyster farms, suggesting pathogen transmission. The risk factors involved in young and adult oyster mortalities were partly different, reflecting distinct origins. Connectivity with oyster farms is a mortality risk factor for both young and adult oysters; thus, disease management strategies that focus on oyster farming areas will impact overall disease risk.Show less"
47,"Becouze-Lareure, C",Jan 1 2016 ,Dynamics of toxicity within different compartments of a peri-urban river subject to combined sewer overflow discharges,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) in small pen-urban streams and rivers are potentially toxic for their biocenosis. Improving the management of CSO discharges requires better knowledge of their dynamics and toxicity. In view to characterizing this toxicity, we sampled the different compartments (benthic and hyporheic zone) of a pen-urban stream located near the city of Lyon in France. The samples were taken at different distances from a CSO and at three period characteristic of different hydrological conditions. Their toxic effects were assessed by bioassays on the dissolved fraction (D. magna, V. fished and B. calyciflorus bioassays) and on the particle fraction (V. fished and H. incongruens bioassays). The results highlighted significant toxicity of the particulate fraction for the benthic and hyporheic samples, in particular downstream of the CSO, but with high spatio-temporal variability. This variability can first be attributed to the variability of CSO discharge sampling as a function of season and rainfall, and the dynamics of polluted particles (trapping of transported particles in infiltration zones, mobilization during floods). These parameters play a fundamental role in the distribution of pollutants according to the geomorphology of stream facies. Regarding dissolved pollutants, the chemical exchanges taking place at the ""water-sediment"" interface trigger the transfer of pollutants from one phase to another, after which the dispersion of these pollutants is governed by hydraulic flows. Finally, critical zones and periods are identified for the pen-urban river toxicity studied: benthic sediments under mean flow downstream: hyporheic sediments after a storm event downstream, close to the CSO. Recommendations are made on the basis of the knowledge obtained to optimize the management of these discharges. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Show less"
48,"Guenther, SM",Jan 30 2014 ,Stream and bed temperature variability in a coastal headwater catchment: influences of surface-subsurface interactions and partial-retention forest harvesting,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream temperature was recorded between 2002 and 2005 at four sites in a coastal headwater catchment in British Columbia, Canada. Shallow groundwater temperatures, along with bed temperature profiles at depths of 1 to 30cm, were recorded at 10-min intervals in two hydrologically distinct reaches beginning in 2003 or 2004, depending on the site. The lower reach had smaller discharge contributions via lateral inflow from the hillslopes and fewer areas with upwelling (UW) and/or neutral flow across the stream bed compared to the middle reach. Bed temperatures were greater than those of shallow groundwater during summer, with higher temperatures in areas of downwelling (DW) flow compared to areas of neutral and UW flow. A paired-catchment analysis revealed that partial-retention forest harvesting in autumn 2004 resulted in higher daily maximum stream and bed temperatures but smaller changes in daily minima. Changes in daily maximum stream temperature, averaged over July and August of the post-harvest year, ranged from 1.6 to 3 degrees C at different locations within the cut block. Post-harvest changes in bed temperature in the lower reach were smaller than the changes in stream temperature, greater at sites with DW flow, and decreased with depth at both UW and DW sites, dropping to about 1 degrees C at a depth of 30cm. In the middle reach, changes in daily maximum bed temperature, averaged over July and August, were generally about 1 degrees C and did not vary significantly with depth. The pre-harvest regression models for shallow groundwater were not suitable for applying the paired-catchment analysis to estimate the effects of harvesting. However, shallow groundwater was warmer at the lower reach following harvesting, despite generally cooler weather compared to the pre-harvest year.

49,"Chen, J",2018 ,Connectivity Evaluation and Planning of a River-Lake System in East China Based on Graph Theory,MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING,"The connectivity of the stream network plays an important role in water-mediated transport and river environments, which are threatened by the rugged development process in China. In this study, based on graph theory, a connectivity evaluation index system was built, which includes the Edge Connectivity, Edge-Node rate, Connectivity Reliability, and Edge Weight. The new evaluation standard and calculation method of each index is presented. The river-lake system of Fenhu industrial park in Jiangsu China is simplified to an Edge-Node graph and evaluated by the index system as a case study. The results indicate that the river-lake system of the research area has low Edge Connectivity, a high Edge-Node rate, and high reliability in the current connectivity level. In addition, the Edge Weight index of several channels does not satisfy the standard of the Basic Edge Weight. To solve the connectivity problems, specific project plans include broadening the unqualified channel and building canals linked with the low-connectivity lakes. The results show that, after the planning, the connectivity of the stream network in Fenhu industrial park will increase, and the connectivity evaluation index system is useful in the study area.Show less"
