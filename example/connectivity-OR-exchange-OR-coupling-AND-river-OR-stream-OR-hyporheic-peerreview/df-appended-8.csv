0,0,"Klaar, MJ",Oct 2020 ,Instream wood increases riverbed temperature variability in a lowland sandy stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The (re)introduction of wood into rivers is becoming increasingly popular in river restoration and natural flood management schemes. While instream wood is known to promote geomorphic and hydraulic diversity, the impact of wood in driving surface water-streambed exchange and subsequent streambed temperatures remains under-researched, particularly in lowland rivers. We make use of the occurrence of three naturally occurring wood structures in a small, lowland sandy stream to determine how the presence of wood alters the geomorphic, hydraulic and thermal properties of the streambed. Our results show that instream wood plays an important role in promoting localized geomorphic complexity and thermal variation in the streambed. Locations within and immediately downstream of wood structures displayed the highest temperature range and daily variation. Locations upstream of wood structures were characterized by weaker daily temperature variation, while areas without wood displayed relatively stable streambed temperatures, with little diurnal fluctuation. Our study indicates that at this lowland site, instream wood increased seasonal temperature extremes (increased summer and decreased winter temperatures) at shallow depths by enhancing infiltration of warmer (summer) and colder (winter) surface water. This reduction in thermal buffering is likely to have significant implications to streambed-dwelling communities and highlights that the thermal impacts of wood reintroduction in lowland rivers should be considered prior to river restoration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000555793500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInstream%2Bwood%2Bincreases%2Briverbed%2Btemperature%2Bvariability%2Bin%2Ba%2Blowland%2Bsandy%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DMegan%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DKlaar%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.3698%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D1542%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1529-1542%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1529%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DKlaar%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DShelley%252C%2BFS%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/rra.3698,"hyporheic exchange flow,hyporheic temperature,large wood,lowland stream restoration,river thermal heterogeneity,thermal refugia","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,LOW-ENERGY,CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY,NITRATE REMOVAL,THERMAL REGIME,WATER-QUALITY,DEBRIS,FLOW,ZONE,RESTORATION",,"Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England"
1,1,"Singley, JG",Oct 2022 ,Identification of hyporheic extent and functional zonation during seasonal streamflow recession by unsupervised clustering of time-lapse electrical resistivity models,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hyporheic exchange influences hydrologic transport and water quality through transient storage, which extends solute transit time, and leads to mixing of surface water and groundwater. Despite its importance, estimating the extent and spatiotemporal variability of the hyporheic zone remains challenging due to limitations in assessing the subsurface with discrete point-scale sampling. Analysis of time-lapse electrical resistivity (ER) data from tracer studies has shown potential to ameliorate such limitations. However, its utility in objectively delimiting hyporheic extent and quantifying changes in surface-groundwater exchange has been impeded by reliance on qualitative analysis of hyporheic extent or the use of a priori assumptions about data quality and signal strength. This study applies a novel unsupervised clustering method to time-lapse ER models derived from a benchmark dataset collected throughout baseflow recession in a mountain stream. We demonstrate that unsupervised clustering of inverted ER model time series can delimit hyporheic extent by distinguishing solute transport signals from noisy background inversions and identify functional zones defined by unique transport characteristics. We found that the structure of these zones was stable even as discharge changed by an order of magnitude, likely due to morphological constraints in this steep, narrow valley. Compared to traditional methods utilizing a priori thresholds to delimit hyporheic extent, clustering is robust to unintentional variations in tracer breakthrough curves that are typical of field-based studies. Therefore, clustering of inverted ER models represents a more robust and data-driven functional zonation representation of hyporheic exchange than has been possible with point-scale sampling or transport modelling, which usually assumes a single well-mixed hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000869408900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14713%26rft.atitle%3DIdentification%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bextent%2Band%2Bfunctional%2Bzonation%2Bduring%2Bseasonal%2Bstreamflow%2Brecession%2Bby%2Bunsupervised%2Bclustering%2Bof%2Btime-lapse%2Belectrical%2Bresistivity%2Bmodels%26rft.aufirst%3DJoel%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DJG%26rft.aulast%3DSingley%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14713%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DSingley%252C%2BJG%26rft.au%3DSingha%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DHinckley%252C%2BELS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14713,"electrical resistivity imaging,H,J,Andrews Experimental Forest,hyporheic exchange,hyporheic zone","SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,GEOPHYSICAL-DATA,SERIES DATA,ZONE,RIVER,DYNAMICS,DENITRIFICATION",,"Roger Williams Univ, Dept Biol Marine Biol & Environm Sci, Bristol, RI 02809 USA"
2,2,"Dent, CL",Oct 1 1999 ,Modelling nutrient-periphyton dynamics in streams with surface-subsurface exchange,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Stream ecosystems include both surface and subsurface components that are connected by the flow of water. Processes occurring in subsurface sediments affect those in the surface, and vice versa. A model was developed to investigate the effects of nutrient transformations occurring in subsurface sediments on the growth of surface-dwelling periphyton. In the model the stream is divided into three zones: free-flowing surface water, a surface storage zone where flow is minimal and where periphyton growth occurs, and a subsurface zone. Parameters were based on information from Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a nitrogen-limited desert stream that has been extensively studied. The behavior of the model was examined both at steady state and as it approached steady state after periphyton biomass was reduced to low values, simulating the effects of a scouring flood. Previous work has shown that subsurface sediments are a source of inorganic nutrients, mainly nitrogen, to surface water and to periphyton communities in Sycamore Creek. Thus it was expected that in this model, periphyton biomass would increase when exchange between surface and subsurface zones was increased, and biomass would also increase when the rate of nutrient transformation in subsurface sediments was increased. Model results confirmed the expectations and highlighted the important role of organic nitrogen in mediating the periphyton-nutrient feedback. Post-flood recovery of periphyton biomass was particularly sensitive to elevated concentrations of inorganic nitrogen in flood water. The model shows that processes in the subsurface zone can have a large effect on surface organisms, and illustrates how surface periphyton communities interact with subsurface microorganisms through the recycling of nutrients.

3,3,"Drummond, JD",Jan 2022 ,Microplastic accumulation in riverbed sediment via hyporheic exchange from headwaters to mainstems,SCIENCE ADVANCES,"In rivers, small and lightweight microplastics are transported downstream, but they are also found frequently in riverbed sediment, demonstrating long-term retention. To better understand microplastic dynamics in global rivers from headwaters to mainstems, we developed a model that includes hyporheic exchange processes, i.e., transport between surface water and riverbed sediment, where microplastic retention is facilitated. Our simulations indicate that the longest microplastic residence times occur in headwaters, the most abundant stream classification. In headwaters, residence times averaged 5 hours/km but increased to 7 years/km during low-flow conditions. Long-term accumulation for all stream classifications averaged similar to 5% of microplastic inputs per river kilometer. Our estimates isolated the impact of hyporheic exchange processes, which are known to influence dynamics of naturally occurring particles in streams, but rarely applied to microplastics. The identified mechanisms and time scales for small and lightweight microplastic accumulation in riverbed sediment reveal that these often-unaccounted components are likely a pollution legacy that is crucial to include in global assessments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000742096800006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Beabi9305%26rft.atitle%3DMicroplastic%2Baccumulation%2Bin%2Briverbed%2Bsediment%2Bvia%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bfrom%2Bheadwaters%2Bto%2Bmainstems%26rft.aufirst%3DJennifer%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DDrummond%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1126%252Fsciadv.abi9305%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2375-2548%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENCE%2BADVANCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BADV%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DSchneidewind%252C%2BU%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=SCIENCE+ADVANCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1126/sciadv.abi9305,,"TRANSPORT,RETENTION,DYNAMICS,SYSTEMS,STREAMS,FATE",,"Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England"
4,4,"Sawyer, AH",Jan 21 2012 ,Hyporheic temperature dynamics and heat exchange near channel-spanning logs,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The flow of river water around large woody debris (LWD) creates pressure gradients along the riverbed that drive river-groundwater mixing, or hyporheic exchange, and heat transport within the hyporheic zone. We quantify hyporheic fluid and heat exchange induced by current interaction with channel-spanning logs using two approaches: laboratory flume experiments and numerical simulations that link turbulent open-channel fluid flow, porous fluid flow, and heat transport. Flume and numerical experiments show that logs produce a characteristic diel temperature pattern within sediment that shifts with log blockage ratio (a fraction of the channel depth blocked by the log), channel Froude number, and sediment permeability. Upstream of a log, downwelling water transports the river's diel thermal signal deep into the sediment. Downstream, upwelling water from shallow flow paths has a thermal signal similar to the surface water, while upwelling water from deep flow paths forms a wedge of buffered (low-amplitude) temperatures. Since most hyporheic water emerges from shallow flow paths, upwelling water has limited potential to buffer surface water temperature. Because of historic channel clearing practices, modern rivers have unnaturally low densities of LWD. A key implication is that LWD removal has contributed to thermal homogenization and potential degradation of hyporheic habitats. LWD reintroduction is a promising strategy to improve vertical connectivity in rivers and increase thermal patchiness within the hyporheic zone. However, hyporheic exchange near LWD may not impact diel surface water temperatures at the reach scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000299385800003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW01529%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Btemperature%2Bdynamics%2Band%2Bheat%2Bexchange%2Bnear%2Bchannel-spanning%2Blogs%26rft.aufirst%3DAudrey%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DAH%26rft.aulast%3DSawyer%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011200%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DButtles%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2011WR011200,,"LARGE WOODY DEBRIS,THERMAL HETEROGENEITY,STREAM ECOSYSTEMS,HABITAT,RIVER,GROUNDWATER,DAMS,WASHINGTON,TROUT,ZONE",,"Univ Delaware, Dept Geol Sci, 101A Penny Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA"
5,5,"De Smedt, F",Jun 10 2007 ,Analytical solution and analysis of solute transport in rivers affected by diffusive transfer in the hyporheic zone,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A model is presented for solute transport in rivers including transient storage in hyporheic zones. The model consists of an advection-clispersion equation for transport in the main channel with a sink term describing diffusive solute transfer to the hyporheic zone. This system of equations is solved analytically for instantaneous injection of a conservative tracer in an infinite uniform river reach with steady flow. The solution enables to estimate the temporal and spatial evolution of tracer concentrations downstream of the injection point with fewer parameters than any other model before. The solution is linked to a non-linear least squares optimisation algorithm to analyse breakthrough curves and estimate solute transport parameters. The model is applied to tracer experiments conducted in the Chittan River, Chile, which were previously analysed with a model including mass exchange between the river and a stagnant storage zone. The fit between observations and model results is good, except for some experiments where the tailing of the fitted curves is more pronounced than observed. Estimates of the water flow velocity are practically identical with previous findings, but the estimates of the cross-sectional area and the dispersion coefficient are markedly different. Estimated values for the diffusion coefficient in the hyporheic zone agree with values cited in literature and with the magnitude of chemical diffusion coefficients in porous media.

6,6,"Singh, T",Jan 2019 ,Dynamic Hyporheic Zones: Exploring the Role of Peak Flow Events on Bedform-Induced Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Discharge varies in space and time, driving hyporheic exchange processes in river corridors that affect biogeochemical cycling and ultimately control the dynamics of biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments. Herein, we use a reduced-order model to conduct the systematic analysis of the interplay between discharge variability (peak flow intensities, duration, and skewness) and streambed topography (bedform aspect ratios and channel slopes) and their role in the flow and transport characteristics of hyporheic zones (HZs). We use a simple and robust conceptualization of single peak flow events for a series of periodic sinusoidal bedforms. Using the model, we estimate the spatial extent of the HZ, the total amount of exchange, and the residence time of water and solutes within the reactive environment and its duration relative to typical time scales for oxygen consumption (i.e., a measure of the denitrification potential). Our results demonstrate that HZ expansion and contraction is controlled by events yet modulated by ambient groundwater flow. Even though the change in hyporheic exchange flux (%) relative to baseflow conditions is invariant for different values of channel slopes, absolute magnitudes varied substantially. Primarily, peak flow events cause more discharge of older water for the higher aspect ratios (i.e., for dunes and ripples) and lower channel slopes. Variations in residence times during peak flow events lead to the development of larger areas of potential nitrification and denitrification in the HZ for longer durations. These findings have potential implications for river management and restoration, particularly the need for (re)consideration of the importance of hyporheic exchange under dynamic flow conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000459536500012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDynamic%2BHyporheic%2BZones%253A%2BExploring%2Bthe%2BRole%2Bof%2BPeak%2BFlow%2BEvents%2Bon%2BBedform-Induced%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%26rft.aufirst%3DTanu%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DSingh%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR022993%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D235%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D218-235%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D218%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DSingh%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BLW%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR022993,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,RESIDENCE TIMES,STORM EVENTS,BED FORMS,STREAM,GROUNDWATER,DISCHARGE,IMPACT,WATER",,"Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England"
7,7,"Adams, JE",Jan 15 2021 ,The bioavailability of oil droplets trapped in river gravel by hyporheic flows,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Little is known about the fate of oil spills in rivers. Hyporheic flows of water through river sediments exchange surface and groundwater and create upwelling and downwelling zones that are important for fish spawning and embryo development. Risk assessments of oil spills to rivers do not consider the potential for hyporheic flows to carry oil droplets into sediments and the potential for prolonged exposure of fish to trapped oil. This project assessed whether oil droplets in water flowing through gravel will be trapped and whether hydrocarbons partitioning from trapped oil droplets are bioavailable to fish. Columns packed with gravel were injected with oil-in-water dispersions prepared with light crude, medium crude, diluted bitumens, and heavy fuel oil to generate a series of oil droplet loadings. The concentrations of oil trapped in the gravel increased with oil loading and viscosity. When the columns were perfused with clean water, oil concentrations in column effluents decreased to the detection limit within the first week of water flow, with sporadically higher concentrations associated with oil droplet release. Despite the low concentrations of hydrocarbons measured in column effluent, hydrocarbons were bioavailable to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) for more than three weeks of water flow, as indicated by strong induction of liver ethoxyresorufln-o-deethylase activity. These findings indicate that ecological risk assessments and spill response should identify and protect areas in rivers sensitive to contaminant trapping. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

8,8,"Clark, JJ",Jan 2019 ,Hyporheic exchange in a gravel bed flume with and without traveling surface waves,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Solute exchange between the pore water of a streambed and overlying flowing surface water can have important effects on the chemical mass balance and biological productivity in the aquatic environment. The base mechanism for driving this hyporheic exchange in a moving current is turbulence at the water- sediment interface and the water surface slope. Many previous studies have shown that the nature of the exchange can be significantly modified when spatial pressure variations, induced by standing surface waves or bed forms, are present in the system. In contrast to these studies, we consider how transient pressure variations induced by moving waves modify hypothetic exchange. This is achieved experimentally by using a vertical array of electrical conductivity probes to track the movement of a conservative solute tracer in the gravel bed of a recirculating laboratory flume under a variety of flow conditions. Our experimental observations indicate that the addition of traveling waves greatly increases the initial rate and depth of solute penetration into the bed. When the analytical solution of a one-dimensional (vertical) advection-dispersion model is fit to the experimental measurements it appears that the presence of traveling surface waves results in a more dispersive hyporheic transport. Through experimental observation, model fitting, and direct simulation we demonstrate that this apparent dispersion dominated transport is due to the vertical ""pumping"" of interstitial fluid in the presence of traveling surface waves. From these simulations we develop a relation that for a given set of flow and wave characteristics allows us to estimate the apparent dispersion due to traveling waves.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000453714000010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Ba%2Bgravel%2Bbed%2Bflume%2Bwith%2Band%2Bwithout%2Btraveling%2Bsurface%2Bwaves%26rft.aufirst%3DJeffrey%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DJJ%26rft.aulast%3DClark%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2018.11.005%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.epage%3D133%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D120-133%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D120%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D123%26rft.au%3DClark%252C%2BJJ%26rft.au%3DQian%252C%2BQ%26rft.au%3DStefan%252C%2BHG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.11.005,"Hyporheic exchange,Travelling surface waves,Gravel bed,Apparent dispersion,Advection-dispersion model","GROUNDWATER INTERACTIONS,SOLUTE EXCHANGE,WATER EXCHANGE,SUBTIDAL PUMP,STREAM WATER,SEDIMENT,TRANSPORT,DISPERSION,MODEL,ZONE",,"Lawrence Univ, Geosci Dept, Appleton, WI 54911 USA"
9,9,"Engelhardt, I",Mar 30 2011 ,Comparison of tracer methods to quantify hydrodynamic exchange within the hyporheic zone,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrodynamic exchange between surface-water and groundwater was studied at a river located within the Rhine Valley in Germany. Piezometric pressure heads and environmental tracers such as temperature, stable isotopes, chloride, X-ray contrast media, and artificial sweetener were investigated within the hyporheic zone and river water plume. Vertical profiles of environmental tracers were collected using multi-level wells within the neutral up-gradient zone, beneath the river bed, and within the horizontal proximal and distal down-gradient zone. infiltration velocities were calculated from pressure heads, temperature fluctuations and gradients. The amount of river water within groundwater was estimated from vertical profiles of chloride, stable isotopes, and persistent pharmaceuticals. Profiles of stable isotopes and chloride reveal the existence of down-welling within the shallow hyporheic zone that is generated by river bed irregularities. Due to down-welling an above-average migration of river water into the hyporheic zone establishes even under upward hydraulic pressure gradients. The investigated environmental tracers could not distinctively display short-time-infiltration velocities representative for flood waves, while average infiltration velocities calculated over several months are uniform displayed. Based on vertical temperature profiles the down-gradient migration of the river water plume could be observed even after long periods of effluent conditions and over a distance of 200 m from the river bank. X-ray contrast media and artificial sweeteners were observed in high concentrations within the proximal zone, but were not detected at a distance of 200 m from the river bank. Using temperature as environmental tracer within the hyporheic zone may result in overestimating the migration of pollutants within the river water plume as the process of natural attenuation will be neglected. Furthermore, temperature was not able to display the effect of down-welling. Stable isotopes and chloride were found to be suitable environmental tracers to forecast the release and fate of organic contaminants within the hyporheic zone. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

10,10,"Camarena, C",Jan 1 2016 ,"Modelling and experimental study of coupled exchange of p,p-DDE and colloids in a flume simulated stream-streambed system",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream-subsurface exchange plays a significant role in the fate and transport of contaminants in streams. It has been modelled explicitly by considering fundamental processes such as hydraulic exchange, colloid filtration, and contaminant interactions with streambed sediments and colloids. The models have been successfully applied to simulate the transport of inorganic metals and nutrients. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted in a recirculating flume to investigate the exchange of a hydrophobic organic contaminant, p,p-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethane (DDE), between a stream and a quartz sand bed. A previously developed process-based multiphase exchange model was modified by accounting for the p,p-DDE kinetic adsorption to and desorption from the bed sediments/colloids and was applied to interpret the experimental results. Model input parameters were obtained by conducting independent small-scale batch experiments. Results indicate that the immobilization of p,p-DDE in the quartz sand bed can occur under representative natural stream conditions. The observed p,p-DDE exchange was successfully simulated by the process-based model. The model sensitivity analysis results show that the exchange of p,p-DDE can be sensitive to either the sediment sorption/desorption parameters or colloidal parameters depending on the experimental conditions tested. For the experimental conditions employed here, the effect of colloids on contaminant transport is expected to be minimal, and the stream-subsurface exchange of p,p-DDE is dominated by the interaction of p,p-DDE with bed sediment. The work presented here contributes to a better mechanistic understanding of the complex transport process that hydrophobic organic contaminants undergo in natural streams and to the development of reliable, predictive models for the assessment of impacted streams.

11,11,"Wolke, P",Jan 2020 ,Impact of Bed Form Celerity on Oxygen Dynamics in the Hyporheic Zone,WATER,"Oxygen distribution and uptake in the hyporheic zone regulate various redox-sensitive reactions and influence habitat conditions. Despite the fact that fine-grain sediments in streams and rivers are commonly in motion, most studies on biogeochemistry have focused on stagnant sediments. In order to evaluate the effect of bed form celerity on oxygen dynamics and uptake in sandy beds, we conducted experiments in a recirculating indoor flume. Oxygen distribution in the bed was measured under various celerities using 2D planar optodes. Bed morphodynamics were measured by a surface elevation sensor and time-lapse photography. Oxygenated zones in stationary beds had a conchoidal shape due to influx through the stoss side of the bed form, and upwelling anoxic water at the lee side. Increasing bed celerity resulted in the gradual disappearance of the upwelling anoxic zone and flattening of the interface between the oxic (moving fraction of the bed) and the anoxic zone (stationary fraction of the bed), as well as in a reduction of the volumetric oxygen uptake rates due shortened residence times in the hyporheic zone. These results suggest that including processes related to bed form migration are important for understanding the biogeochemistry of hyporheic zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000519847200062,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B62%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2BBed%2BForm%2BCelerity%2Bon%2BOxygen%2BDynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DPhilipp%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DWolke%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12010062%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DWolke%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DTeitelbaum%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DArnon%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w12010062,"hyporheic exchange,bed form migration,moving streambed,ripples,planar optodes","STREAM-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,PERMEABLE SEDIMENTS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,BEDFORM MIGRATION,RESIDENCE TIME,TRANSPORT,NUTRIENT,DENITRIFICATION,CONSUMPTION,TOPOGRAPHY",,"Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Zuckerberg Inst Water Res, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, IL-84990 Midreshet Ben Gurion, Israel"
12,12,"Datry, T",Jun 2010 ,Hyporheic annelid distribution along a flow permanence gradient in an alluvial river,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"In this study, we examined hyporheic annelid assemblages along a gradient of flow permanence (FP) and compared assemblages in gaining (groundwater-fed) and losing (runoff-fed) sections of the alluvial Selwyn River, New Zealand. To reduce the effects of poor taxonomic resolution, we used a dataset with most taxa identified to the genus or species level. We predicted that annelid assemblages would vary in structure and composition along FP gradients due to differences in desiccation resistance between taxa. We also predicted that groundwater-fed (gaining) and runoff-fed (losing) river sections would be inhabitated by dissimilar annelid assemblages due to differences in river-aquifer connections and recolonization sources. We found a negative relationship between taxon richness and FP, indicating that, on average, two annelid taxa are lost from hyporheic assemblages in the Selwyn River with every 10% decrease in FP. Low FP appears to favour annelid taxa that tolerate moist or dry conditions in sediments, as shown by a negative relationship between FP and the proportion of desiccation-tolerant taxa. A high proportion of hypogean taxa distinguished the groundwater-fed and perennial-gaining reach from the other reaches. In spite of the large differences in physical structure between the intermittent-gaining and the ephemeral-losing reach, we found few between-reach differences in annelid assemblages and, in particular, no differences in % hypogean taxa. These varied results illustrate the need to employ both categorical and continuous variables in ecological analyses: the combined categorical and gradient approach used in the present study is likely to explain more variability than either univariate approach alone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000278110400008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bannelid%2Bdistribution%2Balong%2Ba%2Bflow%2Bpermanence%2Bgradient%2Bin%2Ban%2Balluvial%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DT.%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DDatry%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-010-0139-6%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D346%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D335-346%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D335%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D72%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DLafont%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLarned%252C%2BST&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00027-010-0139-6,"Oligochaetes,Interstitial sediments,Drying,SW-GW exchanges,Longitudinal patterns,Temporary river","CYST FORMATION,NEW-ZEALAND,INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,OLIGOCHAETE ASSEMBLAGES,LONGITUDINAL PATTERNS,INTERMITTENT-STREAM,TEMPORARY STREAMS,GLACIAL RIVER,PARANA RIVER,DROUGHT",,"Irstea, UR MALY, 3 Bis Quai Chauveau-CP 220, F-69336 Lyon 09, France"

We present a dimensionless metric that quantifies river connectivity as the balance between downstream flow and the exchange of water with the bed, banks, and floodplains. The degree of connectivity directly influences downstream water quality - too little connectivity limits the amount of river water exchanged and leads to biogeochemically inactive water storage, while too much connectivity limits the contact time with sediments for reactions to proceed. Using a metric of reaction significance based on river connectivity, we provide evidence that intermediate levels of connectivity, rather than the highest or lowest levels, are the most efficient in removing nitrogen from Northeastern United States' rivers. Intermediate connectivity balances the frequency, residence time, and contact volume with reactive sediments, which can maximize the reactive processing of dissolved contaminants and the protection of downstream water quality. Our simulations suggest denitrification dominantly occurs in riverbed hyporheic zones of streams and small rivers, whereas vertical turbulent mixing in contact with sediments dominates in mid-size to large rivers. The metrics of connectivity and reaction significance presented here can facilitate scientifically based prioritizations of river management strategies to protect the values and functions of river corridors.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000464285900008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2BHydrologic%2BConnectivity%2BRegulates%2BWater%2BQuality%2Bin%2BRiver%2BCorridors%26rft.aufirst%3DJud%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DHarvey%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.12691%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D381%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D369-381%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D369%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DChoi%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/1752-1688.12691,"hydrologic connectivity,river corridor,hyporheic flow,Clean Water Rule","HYPORHEIC ZONE,DENITRIFICATION,SURFACE,TRANSPORT,EXCHANGE,NETWORKS,SCIENCE,STREAMS,FLUX",,"US Geol Survey, Earth Surface Proc Div, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA"
14,14,"Banzhaf, S",May 2011 ,Investigative approaches to determine exchange processes in the hyporheic zone of a low permeability riverbank,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"The hydraulic and hydrochemical interactions of surface water and groundwater in the riverbank of an alluvial stream in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were investigated. Hydraulic conductivity in the riverbank is low and the aquifer is confined. Gauged surface-water levels and groundwater levels were recorded over several months to observe potential effluent and influent aquifer conditions. Water samples were taken under different hydraulic conditions in the stream and from three observation wells in the riverbank. Samples were analysed for inorganic parameters and selected dissolved pharmaceuticals. The recorded groundwater levels in the riverbank responded almost without delay to changes in stream stage, which is very dynamic. Frequent changes from effluent to influent aquifer conditions were observed. The analyses for selected ions and pharmaceuticals support the assumption that the pharmaceutical compounds enter the riverbank via the stream only. The chosen trace organics are therefore suitable as anthropogenic tracers for groundwater and surface-water interactions at this field site. They prove that water exchanges also take place in riverbanks even where the hydraulic conductivity is low and for this reason indicate the existence of a hyporheic zone in the investigated section of the stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000289002500006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInvestigative%2Bapproaches%2Bto%2Bdetermine%2Bexchange%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Blow%2Bpermeability%2Briverbank%26rft.aufirst%3DStefan%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DBanzhaf%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-011-0707-4%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D591-601%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D591%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DBanzhaf%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DKrein%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DScheytt%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-011-0707-4,"Groundwater/surface-water relations,Pharmaceuticals,Hyporheic exchange,Solute transport,Luxembourg","ORGANIC PERSISTENT POLLUTANTS,SURFACE-WATER,WASTE-WATER,GROUNDWATER,ENVIRONMENT,RESIDUES,PHARMACEUTICALS,COEFFICIENTS,SUBSTANCES,REMOVAL",,"Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Appl Geosci, Hydrogeol Res Grp, Ackerstr 76, D-13355 Berlin, Germany"
15,15,"O'Connor, BL",Dec 17 2008 ,Scaling hyporheic exchange and its influence on biogeochemical reactions in aquatic ecosystems,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical reactions are difficult to quantify because of the range in fluid-flow and sediment conditions inherent to streams, wetlands, and nearshore marine ecosystems. Field measurements of biogeochemical reactions in aquatic systems are impeded by the difficulty of measuring hyporheic flow simultaneously with chemical gradients in sediments. Simplified models of hyporheic exchange have been developed using Darcy's law generated by flow and bed topography at the sediment-water interface. However, many modes of transport are potentially involved ( molecular diffusion, bioturbation, advection, shear, bed mobility, and turbulence) with even simple models being difficult to apply in complex natural systems characterized by variable sediment sizes and irregular bed geometries. In this study, we synthesize information from published hyporheic exchange investigations to develop a scaling relationship for estimating mass transfer in near-surface sediments across a range in fluid-flow and sediment conditions. Net hyporheic exchange was quantified using an effective diffusion coefficient ( De) that integrates all of the various transport processes that occur simultaneously in sediments, and dimensional analysis was used to scale De to shear stress velocity, roughness height, and permeability that describe fluid-flow and sediment characteristics. We demonstrated the value of the derived scaling relationship by using it to quantify dissolved oxygen ( DO) uptake rates on the basis of DO profiles in sediments and compared them to independent flux measurements. The results support a broad application of the De scaling relationship for quantifying coupled hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical reaction rates in streams and other aquatic ecosystems characterized by complex fluid-flow and sediment conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000261889400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW12423%26rft.atitle%3DScaling%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bits%2Binfluence%2Bon%2Bbiogeochemical%2Breactions%2Bin%2Baquatic%2Becosystems%26rft.aufirst%3DBen%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DBL%26rft.aulast%3DO%2527Connor%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007160%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DO%2527Connor%252C%2BBL%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2008WR007160,,"STREAM-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,BED FORMS,DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,SEDIMENT TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,OXYGEN-UPTAKE,FLOW-THROUGH,FLUX,DENITRIFICATION",,"US Geol Survey, Mail Stop,430 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 20192 USA"
16,16,"Marion, A",May 2003 ,Parameter estimation of the transient storage model for stream-subsurface exchange,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,"The transient storage model (TSM) is the most commonly used model for stream-subsurface exchange of solutes. The TSM provides a convenient, simplified representation of hyporheic exchange, but its lack of a true physical basis causes its parameters to be difficult to predict. However, the simple formulation makes the model a useful practical tool for many applications. This work compares the TSM with a physically based pumping model. This comparison is advantageous for two reasons: Advective pumping is known to be an important hyporheic exchange process in many streams, and the pumping model can be used to derive dimensionless transient storage parameters that are properly scaled with important physical stream parameters. Transient storage model parameters are shown to be dependent on both the timescale of observation and the shape of the breakthrough curve, i.e., on the temporal evolution of the solute concentration in the surface water. This indicates that the transient storage model can, in practice, lead to incorrect predictions when model parameters are obtained without consideration of the stream flow dynamics, the properties of the stream bed, or the process timescale. This work emphasizes the limitations of simplified models for hyporheic transport, and indicates that such models need to be carefully applied.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000182297500010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DParameter%2Bestimation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bstream-subsurface%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarion%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9372%25282003%2529129%253A5%2528456%2529%26rft.eissn%3D1943-7870%26rft.epage%3D463%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9372%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D456-463%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D456%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D129%26rft.au%3DMarion%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DZaramella%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2003)129:5(456),"models,subsurface environment,solutes,hydraulic transients,streams","SOLUTE TRANSPORT,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,WATER EXCHANGE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,BED,RETENTION,CHANNEL",,"Univ Padua, Dept Hydraul Maritime Environm & Geotech Engn, Via Loredon 20, I-35100 Padua, Italy"
17,17,"McGarr, JT",Sep 2021 ,Geophysical mapping of hyporheic processes controlled by sedimentary architecture within compound bar deposits,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hyporheic exchange influences water quality and controls numerous physical, chemical, and biological processes. Despite its importance, hyporheic exchange and the associated dynamics of solute mixing are often difficult to characterize due to spatial (e.g., sedimentary heterogeneity) and temporal (e.g., river stage fluctuation) variabilities. This study coupled geophysical techniques with physical and chemical sediment analyses to map sedimentary architecture and quantify its influence on hyporheic exchange dynamics within a compound bar deposit in a gravel-dominated river system in southwestern Ohio. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) was used to quantify variability in electrical conductivity within the compound bar. EMI informed locations of electrode placement for time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) surveys, which were used to examine changes in electrical resistivity driven by hyporheic exchange. Both geophysical methods revealed a zone of high electrical conductivity in the center of the bar, identified as a fine-grained cross-bar channel fill. The zone acts as a baffle to flow, evidenced by stable electrical conditions measured by time-lapse ERI over the study period. Large changes in electrical resistivity throughout the survey period indicate preferential flowpaths through higher permeability sands and gravels. Grain size analyses confirmed sedimentological interpretations of geophysical data. Loss on ignition and x-ray fluorescence identified zones with higher organic matter content that are locations for potentially enhanced geochemical activity within the cross-bar channel fill. Differences in the physical and geochemical characteristics of cross-bar channel fills play an important role in hyporheic flow dynamics and nutrient processing within riverbed sediments. These findings enhance our understanding of the applications of geophysical methods in mapping riverbed heterogeneity and highlight the importance of accurately representing geomorphologic features and heterogeneity when studying hyporheic exchange processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000700789300010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14358%26rft.atitle%3DGeophysical%2Bmapping%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bprocesses%2Bcontrolled%2Bby%2Bsedimentary%2Barchitecture%2Bwithin%2Bcompound%2Bbar%2Bdeposits%26rft.aufirst%3DJeffery%2BTyler%26rft.auinit%3DJT%26rft.aulast%3DMcGarr%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14358%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DMcGarr%252C%2BJT%26rft.au%3DWallace%252C%2BCD%26rft.au%3DSoltanian%252C%2BMR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14358,"compound bar,cross-bar channel,electrical resistivity imaging,electromagnetic induction,heterogeneity,hyporheic exchange","ELECTRICAL-RESISTIVITY TOMOGRAPHY,ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION,HOT MOMENTS,WATER,SOIL,ZONE,EXCHANGE,INVERSION,FLOW,NITROGEN",,"Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA"
18,18,"Wu, YX",Sep 25 2013 ,Hyporheic exchange in a karst conduit and sediment system - A laboratory analog study,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Karst conduits are often partly filled by clastic sediments. Flow through such sediments can have a strong impact on the fate of sediment-entrapped contaminants. In contrast to stream bed sediments, hyporheic flow in karst sediments has received little attention so far. For karst sediments, conduit bends could induce hyporheic flow, in addition to bedforms or obstacles. The main aim of this study was to investigate flow processes in a conduit-sediment system using a laboratory model resembling a siphon and numerical modeling. In the laboratory system, zones with forward and reserve flow occurred in the sediment due to the conduit bends. As demonstrated with sediment-source tracer test, entrapped solutes were generally flushed out more rapidly at a higher flow rate and steeper conduit angle. Numerical modeling assuming pressure continuity across the conduit-sediment interface reproduced the flow patterns and breakthrough curves (BTCs) well. Based on the model, the magnitude of hyporheic exchange is expected to increase linearly with the flow rate and was higher for a steeper conduit angle. However, the increase in flushing intensity was not evenly distributed throughout the sediments but occurred mainly adjacent to the conduit bends consistent with observations from tracer tests. This study confirms that conduit bends could have a strong influence on hyporheic flow in karst sediments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This exchange of water and solutes that occurs across the stream-sediment interface plays an important role for fluvial ecology because of the unique biochemical conditions, rich biodiversity, and high rates of metabolism. While many studies have observed the extent of the hyporheic zone to be modified by changes in the level of the groundwater table, the actual importance of this interaction is still difficult to quantify. Here, we focus on the case of bedform induced hyporheic exchange to show how the the volume of hyporheic sediments that receive water from the stream is significantly reduced by the upwelling of subsurface water. A simple scaling relationship for the assessment of maximum depth of the hyporheic zone is proposed by relating hyporheic flow to the groundwater discharge in an aquifer with given hydraulic properties and head difference between the stream and the aquifer.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000255593400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BL09401%26rft.atitle%3DReduction%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bvolume%2Bdue%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bstream-aquifer%2Binteraction%26rft.aufirst%3DFulvio%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DBoano%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008GL033554%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DBoano%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DRevelli%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DRidolfi%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2008GL033554,,"SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,BED FORMS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,SURFACE-WATER,MODEL,GROUNDWATER,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS",,"Politecn Torino, Dept Hydraul Transport & Civil Infrastruct, Corso Duca Degli Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy"

Two laboratory analogues consisting of siphon structured glass tubes (with bend angles of 15 and 45A degrees) were used for the experimental studies. Tracer experiments were performed in each analogue with sediments of variable grain size (0.45 mm, 0.4-0.7 mm, 1 mm) to characterize the transport properties of contaminants originating from the sediments. Numerical simulations were used to probe the exchange flow patterns and exchange flux magnitudes between the conduit and sediment. Tracer experiments demonstrated a zone of forward flow and a zone of reverse flow in the sediments that were independent of grain size, which were reproduced well by numerical simulations. The exchange flux ranged from 0.02% for fine grains to 2% for coarse grains under the experimental flow conditions. A linear relationship between the exchange flux and the conduit Re value, which was independent of the conduit geometry and sediment grain size, was established with numerical simulations.

Hyporheic flow in pool-riffle channels is particularly complex because of three-dimensional topography that spans a range of partially to fully submerged conditions, inducing both static and dynamic head variations. Hence, these channels exhibit transitional conditions of streambed pressure and hyporheic flow compared to previous studies of fully submerged, two-dimensional bed forms. Here, we conduct a series of three-dimensional simulations to investigate the effects of bed topography, depth of alluvium, and stream discharge on hyporheic flow in pool-riffle reaches with variable bed form submergence, and we propose three empirical formulae to predict the mean depth of hyporheic exchange and characteristic values of the residence time distribution (mean and standard deviation). Hyporheic exchange is predicted with a three-dimensional pumping model, and hyporheic flow is modeled as a Darcy flow. We find that the hyporheic residence time is well approximated by a lognormal distribution for both partially and entirely submerged pool-riffle topography, with the parameters of the distribution defined by the mean and variance of the log-transformed residence time. Depth of alluvium has a substantial effect on hyporheic flow when alluvial depth is less than a third of the bed form wavelength for the conditions examined.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000293650200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08508%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bdischarge%252C%2Balluvial%2Bdepth%2Band%2Bbar%2Bamplitude%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bin%2Bpool-riffle%2Bchannels%26rft.aufirst%3DDaniele%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DTonina%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR009140%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DBuffington%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2010WR009140,,"SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE,BED FORMS,HYDRAULIC ROUGHNESS,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,SPAWNING HABITAT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,RESIDENCE TIME,SURFACE,ZONE",,"Univ Idaho, Coll Engn Boise, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, 322 E Front St,Ste 340, Boise, ID 83702 USA"
23,23,"Storey, RG",Feb 18 2003 ,Factors controlling riffle-scale hyporheic exchange flows and their seasonal changes in a gaining stream: A three-dimensional groundwater flow model,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Subsurface flow within a single riffle of a low-gradient gravel bed stream was modeled in three dimensions using MODFLOW, a finite difference groundwater flow model. Model simulations showed that exchange flows can only occur in this low-gradient, gaining stream because of a zone of alluvial sediment around the stream that has much higher permeability than the surrounding catchment (K = 10(-4) m s(-1), compared with K = 10(-6) to 10(-8) m s(-1)). The key factors controlling exchange flow within the alluvial zone were identified as the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium, the hydraulic gradient between upstream and downstream ends of the riffle, and the flux of groundwater entering the alluvium from the sides and beneath. In the study riffle each of these factors changes with season, causing a reversal of flow paths in the alluvium and a reduction in exchange flows from about 0.2 - 0.5 m(3) d(-1) per meter stream length in summer to about 0.008-0.04 m(3) d(-1) per meter stream length during fall to spring. The model also revealed that exchange flows are up to twice as strong, but more variable, at the sides of the stream than near the center, and that vertical flow paths beneath the channel are more persistent under the range of conditions modeled than lateral flow paths into the banks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000181988000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1034%26rft.atitle%3DFactors%2Bcontrolling%2Briffle-scale%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bflows%2Band%2Btheir%2Bseasonal%2Bchanges%2Bin%2Ba%2Bgaining%2Bstream%253A%2BA%2Bthree-dimensional%2Bgroundwater%2Bflow%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DRG%26rft.auinit%3DRG%26rft.aulast%3DStorey%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2002WR001367%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DStorey%252C%2BRG%26rft.au%3DHoward%252C%2BKWF%26rft.au%3DWilliams%252C%2BDD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2002WR001367,"hyporheic zone,groundwater-surface water interactions,modeling,MODFLOW","SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,HEADWATER STREAMS,MOUNTAIN STREAM,ZONE,RETENTION,RIVERS,TEMPERATURE,ECOSYSTEMS,TRANSPORT",,"A Rocha Lebanon, The Bekaa, Lebanon"
24,24,"Stonedahl, SH",Oct 6 2012 ,Physical controls and predictability of stream hyporheic flow evaluated with a multiscale model,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Improved predictions of hyporheic exchange based on easily measured physical variables are needed to improve assessment of solute transport and reaction processes in watersheds. Here we compare physically based model predictions for an Indiana stream with stream tracer results interpreted using the Transient Storage Model (TSM). We parameterized the physically based, Multiscale Model (MSM) of stream-groundwater interactions with measured stream planform and discharge, stream velocity, streambed hydraulic conductivity and porosity, and topography of the streambed at distinct spatial scales (i.e., ripple, bar, and reach scales). We predicted hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic residence times using the MSM. A Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) model was used to convert the MSM output into predictions of in stream solute transport, which we compared with field observations and TSM parameters obtained by fitting solute transport data. MSM simulations indicated that surface-subsurface exchange through smaller topographic features such as ripples was much faster than exchange through larger topographic features such as bars. However, hyporheic exchange varies nonlinearly with groundwater discharge owing to interactions between flows induced at different topographic scales. MSM simulations showed that groundwater discharge significantly decreased both the volume of water entering the subsurface and the time it spent in the subsurface. The MSM also characterized longer timescales of exchange than were observed by the tracer-injection approach. The tracer data, and corresponding TSM fits, were limited by tracer measurement sensitivity and uncertainty in estimates of background tracer concentrations. Our results indicate that rates and patterns of hyporheic exchange are strongly influenced by a continuum of surface-subsurface hydrologic interactions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales rather than discrete processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309609000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW10513%26rft.atitle%3DPhysical%2Bcontrols%2Band%2Bpredictability%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bevaluated%2Bwith%2Ba%2Bmultiscale%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DSusa%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DSH%26rft.aulast%3DStonedahl%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011582%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DStonedahl%252C%2BSH%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2011WR011582,,"SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,TRANSIENT STORAGE,RANDOM-WALKS,GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,SEASONAL-VARIATION,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,ORGANIC-MATTER,MATLAB-TOOLBOX",,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd,Tech A314, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"
25,25,"Marzadri, A",Feb 2016 ,"Mixing interfaces, fluxes, residence times and redox conditions of the hyporheic zones induced by dune-like bedforms and ambient groundwater flow",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Recent studies highlighted the importance of the interface between streams and their surrounding sediment, known as the hyporheic zone, where stream waters flow through the alluvium. These pore water fluxes stem from the interaction among streambed morphology, stream hydraulics and surrounding groundwater flow. We analytically model the hyporheic hydraulics induced by a spatially uniform ambient groundwater flow made of a horizontal, underflow, and a vertical, basal, component, which mimics gaining and losing stream conditions. The proposed analytical solution allows to investigate the control of simple hydromorphological quantities on the extent, residence time and redox conditions of the hyporheic zone, and the thickness of the mixing interface between hyporheic and groundwater cells. Our analysis shows that the location of the mixing zone shallows or deepens in the sediment as a function of bedform geometry, surface hydraulic and groundwater flow. The point of stagnation, where hyporheic flow velocities vanish and where the separation surface passes through, is shallower than or coincides with the deepest point of the hyporheic zone only due to underflow. An increase of the ambient flow causes a reduction of the hyporheic zone volume similarly in both losing and gaining conditions. The hyporheic residence time is lognormally distributed under neutral, losing and gaining conditions, with the residence time moments depending on the same set of parameters describing dune morphology and stream flow.

26,26,"Mathers, KL",Nov 2014 ,Faunal response to benthic and hyporheic sedimentation varies with direction of vertical hydrological exchange,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Sedimentation and clogging of benthic and hyporheic zone substrata is increasingly being recognised as one of the greatest threats to the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems globally. This ex situ study examined the influence of sedimentation (surface and subsurface) and pattern of hydrological exchange on the vertical distribution of the freshwater shrimp Gammarus pulex within the experimental substrata of running water mesocosms.2. Six sediment treatments representing a continuum from a clean gravel substratum to heavy sediment loading of both surface (benthic) and subsurface (hyporheic) substrata were used to examine the distribution of G. pulex in relation to the direction of hydrological exchange (downwelling, upwelling and no exchange).3. The distribution of G. pulex between the sediment layers was dependent on the pattern of hydrological exchange, sediment treatment and the interaction between these two factors.4. Sedimentation of the surface layer under no-exchange conditions resulted in a lower proportion of G. pulex being recorded in the benthic sediments, whilst there were no significant differences under downwelling and upwelling flow conditions.5. Sedimentation of multiple layers of the column (benthic and subsurface) reduced the ability of individuals to utilise the subsurface layers of the substratum (i.e. the hyporheic zone) under no-exchange and upwelling conditions. However, with downwelling conditions, the abundance of G. pulex declined with depth regardless of the fine sediment distribution or volume.6. This study demonstrates that faunal movement, and use of benthic and hyporheic substrata, may be influenced by sedimentation and modified by the pattern of vertical hydrological exchange. Severe sedimentation (colmation) has the potential to prevent benthic fauna from accessing the hyporheic zone and its resources which may ultimately lead to a reduction in stream diversity and metabolism, thereby limiting overall productivity and lotic ecosystem resilience.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000343047000006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFaunal%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Bbenthic%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bsedimentation%2Bvaries%2Bwith%2Bdirection%2Bof%2Bvertical%2Bhydrological%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DKate%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DKL%26rft.aulast%3DMathers%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffwb.12430%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D2289%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2278-2289%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2278%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D59%26rft.au%3DMathers%252C%2BKL%26rft.au%3DMillett%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DWood%252C%2BPJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/fwb.12430,"colmation,fine sediment,mesocosm experiments,surface water and groundwater exchange,upwelling and downwelling","GAMMARUS SPP.

27,27,"Peter, KT",Mar 1 2019 ,Evaluating emerging organic contaminant removal in an engineered hyporheic zone using high resolution mass spectrometry,WATER RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone (HZ), located at the interface of surface and groundwater, is a natural bioreactor for attenuation of chemical contaminants. Engineered HZs can be incorporated into stream restoration projects to enhance hyporheic exchange, with flowpaths optimized to promote biological habitat, water quantity, and water quality improvements. Designing HZs for in-stream treatment of stormwater, a significant source of flow and contaminant loads to urban creeks, requires assessment of both the hydrology and biogeochemical capacity for water quality improvement. Here, we applied tracer tests and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to characterize an engineered hyporheic zone unit process, called a hyporheic design element (HDE), in the Thornton Creek Watershed in Seattle, WA. Dye, NaCl, and bromide were used to hydrologically link downwelling and upwelling zones and estimate the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of hyporheic flowpaths. We then compared water quality improvements across hydrologically-linked surface and hyporheic flowpaths (3-5 m length; similar to 30 min to >3 h) during baseflow and stormflow conditions. We evaluated fate outcomes for 83 identified contaminants during stormflow, including those correlated with an urban runoff mortality syndrome in coho salmon. Non-target HRMS analysis was used to assess holistic water quality improvements and evaluate attenuation mechanisms. The data indicated substantial water quality improvement in hyporheic flowpaths relative to surface flow and improved contaminant removal with longer hyporheic HRT (for similar to 1900 non-target compounds detected during stormflow, <17% were attenuated >50% via surface flow vs. 59% and 78% via short and long hyporheic residence times, respectively), and strong contributions of hydrophobic sorption towards observed contaminant attenuation.

Among the factors that drive water exchange between a stream and its sediments, turbulence is the most ubiquitous as rivers are always in turbulent flow regime. However, there is still much uncertainty about the role of turbulent processes in hyporheic exchange, probably because of the complex nonlinearities that characterize the dynamics of turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations. In this paper, we adopt a numerical modeling approach to investigate the relationship between turbulent pressure properties and the resulting features of surface-subsurface exchange.

29,29,"Hester, ET",Sep 2013 ,Mixing of surface and groundwater induced by riverbed dunes: Implications for hyporheic zone definitions and pollutant reactions,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone is often defined as where mixing of surface water and groundwater occurs in shallow sediments beneath and adjacent to rivers. This mixing is credited with creating unique biogeochemical conditions that can attenuate contaminants from either upstream surface water or groundwater under gaining conditions. However, reactions of contaminants upwelling from groundwater may be more dependent on such mixing than contaminants from surface water. We numerically modeled mixing between hyporheic flow paths induced by riverbed dunes and flow paths of adjacent upwelling of deeper groundwater. Results show that only 12.7% or less tracer mass upwelling from deeper groundwater dispersed across into hyporheic flow paths originating in surface water. The spatial extent of a mixing-defined hyporheic zone was smaller than a hyporheic zone defined as hydrologic flow paths leaving and returning to surface water. Mixing-dependent reactions will therefore be localized within a thin mixing zone yet vary considerably with site conditions. For example, mixing in homogeneous sediments was controlled most by variation in hydraulic conductivity and upwelling flow rate which primarily affected mixing zone length. By contrast, introduction of heterogeneity increased mixing primarily by increasing mixing zone thickness, consistent with studies of flow focusing in aquifers. Finally, dispersivity is a critical parameter for which data are needed for shallow sediments. Our results help clarify hyporheic zone definitions and potential for mixing-dependent reactions. In particular, the biogeochemically reactive portion of riverbed sediments from the perspective of upwelling contaminants does not necessarily spatially coincide with more traditional hydrologic conceptions of the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000325991100008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMixing%2Bof%2Bsurface%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Binduced%2Bby%2Briverbed%2Bdunes%253A%2BImplications%2Bfor%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bdefinitions%2Band%2Bpollutant%2Breactions%26rft.aufirst%3DE.%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20399%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D5237%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5221-5237%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5221%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DYoung%252C%2BKI%26rft.au%3DWiddowson%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20399,"contaminants,hyporheic exchange,natural attenuation,sediments,streams,surface water groundwater interaction","SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,GRAVEL-BED RIVER,NONSORBING SOLUTES,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,STREAM,EXCHANGE,FLOW,DISPERSION,FORMS",,"Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 220-D Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"

The corroborated results suggest that the CHZ represents a typically shallow habitat (approx. 40-50 cm deep), with a homogenous distribution of both fauna and chemistry between heads and tails of riffles (putative down and, respectively, upwelling zones). Despite being groundwater fed, the CHZ is equally influenced by surface waters, chemically and biologically. However, despite its shallowness, the CHZ plays a very important role in nutrients (re)cycling and in the energy flux towards river ecosystems, fuelling benthic food webs with surface-derived macronutrients and subsurface chemosynthetic C. Although groundwater variation influences strongly the river flow during winter, the effects on interstitial fauna dynamic are limited, suggesting the active role of CHZ played in the stochastic events of down/upward migration of fauna across habitats. Overall, the CHZ represents a confined, but critical habitat in the structure and functionality of chalk river ecosystems and fulfils most properties of a true ecotone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394354700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bchalk%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2Ba%2Btrue%2Becotone%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DOctavian%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DPacioglu%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-016-3035-9%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D12%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1-12%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D790%26rft.au%3DPacioglu%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DParvulescu%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-016-3035-9,"Chalk hyporheic zone,Ecotone properties,Groundwater,Chalk streams","GROUNDWATER INTERFACE,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,ORGANIC-MATTER,RIVER LAMBOURN,LOWLAND RIVER,STREAM,INVERTEBRATES,CATCHMENT,SEDIMENT,DYNAMICS",,"West Univ Timisoara, Dept Biol Chem, Fac Chem, Biol,Geog, Timisoara 300115, Romania"
31,31,"Heppell, C",Mar 2014 ,Interpreting spatial patterns in redox and coupled water-nitrogen fluxes in the streambed of a gaining river reach,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Water pathways through permeable riverbeds are multi-dimensional, including lateral hyporheic exchange flows as well as vertical (upwelling and downwelling) fluxes. The influence of different pathways of water on solute patterns and the supply of nitrate and other redox-sensitive chemical species in the riverbed is poorly understood but could be environmentally significant. For example, nitrate-rich upwelling water in the gaining reaches of groundwater-fed rivers has the potential to supply significant quantities of nitrate through the riverbed to surface waters, constraining opportunities to deliver the goals of the EU Water Framework Directive to achieve 'good ecological status'. We show that patterns in porewater chemistry in the armoured river bed of a gaining reach (River Leith, Cumbria) reflect the spatial variability in different sources of water; oxic conditions being associated with preferential discharge from groundwater and reducing conditions with longitudinal and lateral fluxes of water due to water movement from riparian zones and/or hyporheic exchange flows. Our findings demonstrate the important control of both vertical and lateral water fluxes on patterns of redox-sensitive chemical species in the river bed. Furthermore, under stable, baseflow conditions (< Q(90)) a zone of preferential discharge, comprising 20 % of the reach by area contributes 4-9 % of the total nitrate being transported through the reach in surface water, highlighting the need to understand the spatial distribution of such preferential discharge locations at the catchment scale to establish their importance for nitrate delivery to the stream channel.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000333703400017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInterpreting%2Bspatial%2Bpatterns%2Bin%2Bredox%2Band%2Bcoupled%2Bwater-nitrogen%2Bfluxes%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bstreambed%2Bof%2Ba%2Bgaining%2Briver%2Breach%26rft.aufirst%3DCatherine%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DHeppell%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-013-9895-4%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D509%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D2-3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D491-509%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D491%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D117%26rft.au%3DHeppell%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DHeathwaite%252C%2BAL%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10533-013-9895-4,"Hyporheic,Nitrate,Hydrological pathways,Groundwater-fed,Rivers,Water quality,Pollution","GROUNDWATER NITRATE,RIPARIAN ZONE,DENITRIFICATION,DISCHARGE,RESTORATION,PATHWAYS,DYNAMICS,UK",,"Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England"
32,32,"Dai, LQ",Dec 2013 ,A Coupled Model for predicting the Effect of the Three Gorges Reservoir on Downstream River-Connected Lakes,DISASTER ADVANCES,"Reservoirs construction along with associated regulation of the downstream water course is a major way by which human activity can modify the hydrologic regime of rivers and then has a potential effect on downstream river-connected lakes which are sensitive to water level variation. In order to quantitatively predict and assess the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) on river-connected lakes in the middle region of the Yangtze River, we developed an integrated one-dimensional (1D)/two-dimensional (2D) coupled hydrodynamic model which covers Yangtze River from dam site to Datong hydrologic station, Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake and their main tributaries. On the basis of calibrated and validated the coupled model, we used actual and unregulated release from the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) as upstream boundary condition, compared actual releases and the water level of Poyang Lake to unregulated releases from TGR.The results indicate that dam regulation has changed the temporal patterns in discharge in the Yangtze River especially in the emptying stage from May to June and the impoundment stage from September to October. During the emptying stage the release averagely increased by 3760 m(3)/s and the lake water level increased by 0.42m respectively. On the contrary, during the impoundment stage, the release decreased by 4200m(3)/s and the lake water level decreased by 0.57m respectively. But this has limited impacts on the Poyang Lake in normal year. When the Poyang Lake basin is in extreme dry years, other measures such as building a floodgate at the lake mouth to regulate the lake water level should be taken.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000327882500010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BCoupled%2BModel%2Bfor%2Bpredicting%2Bthe%2BEffect%2Bof%2Bthe%2BThree%2BGorges%2BReservoir%2Bon%2BDownstream%2BRiver-Connected%2BLakes%26rft.aufirst%3DL.%2BQ.%26rft.auinit%3DLQ%26rft.aulast%3DDai%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft.eissn%3D2278-4543%26rft.epage%3D83%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0974-262X%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DDISASTER%2BADVANCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D78-83%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D78%26rft.stitle%3DDISASTER%2BADV%26rft.volume%3D6%26rft.au%3DDai%252C%2BLQ%26rft.au%3DDai%252C%2BHC%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BPP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=DISASTER+ADVANCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"1D/2D coupled model,Three Gorges Reservoir(TGR),river-connected lakes,Poyang Lake,effect","IMPOUNDMENT,IMPACT,DAM",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
33,33,"Kasahara, T",Apr 1 2008 ,Modeling the effects of lowland stream restoration projects on stream-subsurface water exchange,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"The relative effect of individual elements of restoration projects on stream-subsurface water exchange was studied by identifying elements that were most effective in increasing downwelling stream water (DSW) into subsurface environments using groundwater flow modeling. Several restoration projects studied in lowland streams involved riffle-pool construction, lateral gravel bar construction and channel re-meandering. Simulations using a homogeneous field of mean hydraulic conductivity that removed heterogeneity showed a large decline in DSW in the four restoration projects studied, suggesting that use of coarse sediments in construction initially increases stream-subsurface water exchange, but the effects may not persist in streams where fine sediments clog streambeds. In two riffle-pool construction projects studied, modification of the channel gradient showed a greater effect on DSW than the alteration of substrate texture. In the gravel bar construction site, modeling results indicated that the construction of a riffle-pool sequence along the bar had a greater effect than the construction of the gravel bar itself. In contrast in the channel re-meandering site, the combination of a greater sinuosity and a lower hydraulic head along the small riffles resulted in re-meandering having a greater effect than the associated riffle-pool construction. A simulation in which the floodplain sediments of low saturated hydraulic conductivity at the re-meandered site were replaced with sandy gravels increased DSW by 10 times. This modeling suggests that the addition of coarse sediments in combination with re-meandering would be required to significantly enhance stream-subsurface water exchange in reaches with fine-grained floodplain sediments. Designing the size and type of morphologic features constructed in restoration projects is somewhat flexible, and the use of modeling to simulate stream-groundwater interactions may help to enhance the hydrologic link with a stream and the subsurface environment in restored stream reaches.

34,34,"Daniluk, TL",Dec 15 2013 ,Surface water-groundwater interaction at restored streams and associated reference reaches,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream restoration goals include improving habitat and water quality through reconstruction of morphological features found at analogous, pristine stream reaches. Enhancing hyporheic exchange may facilitate achieving these goals. Although hyporheic exchange at restoration sites has been explored in a few previous studies, comparative studies of restored versus reference or control streams are largely absent. We hypothesized that restoration cross-vanes enhance hyporheic exchange, resulting in biogeochemical alteration of stream water chemistry in the streambed. Two streams restored using cross-vanes to control erosion and improve habitat were compared with their associated reference reaches, which provided the basis for the restoration design. Thirteen temperature profile rods with vertically stacked sensors were installed at each site for 2weeks. Heat tracing was used to quantify vertical flux in the streambed from the diurnal temperature fluctuations in the subsurface. Stream water and bed pore waters from mini-piezometers were analysed for ion and nutrient chemistry. In general, mean vertical flux rates through the streambed were small throughout reference sites (-0.3 to 0.3m/day) and at most locations at restored sites. Immediately adjacent to cross-vanes, vertical flux rates were larger (up to 3.5m/day). Geochemistry of pore waters shows distinct differences in the sources for the reference and restored sites. Strong downwelling zones adjacent to cross-vanes showed high dissolved oxygen (10.75mg/l) and geochemistry in the streambed similar to surface water. Reference sites had lower dissolved oxygen in the streambed (0.66-5.14mg/l), and geochemical patterns suggest a mixture of discharging groundwater and surface water in the hyporheic zone. Restored sites also clearly show sulfate and nitrate reduction occurring in the streambed, which is not observed at the reference sites. The stream restoration sites studied here enhance rapid hyporheic exchange, but upwelling of groundwater has a stronger influence on streambed geochemistry at reference sites.

35,35,"Ellis, PA",Apr 1 2007 ,Quantifying urban river-aquifer fluid exchange processes: A multi-scale problem,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,"Groundwater-river exchanges in an urban setting have been investigated through long term field monitoring and detailed modelling of a 7 km reach of the Tame river as it traverses the unconfined Triassic Sandstone aquifer that lies beneath the City of Birmingham, UK. Field investigations and numerical modelling have been completed at a range of spatial and temporal scales from the metre to the kilometre scale and from event (hourly) to multi-annual time scales. The objective has been to quantify the spatial and temporal flow distributions governing mixing processes at the aquifer-river interface that can affect the chemical activity in the hyporheic zone of this urbanised river. The hyporheic zone is defined to be the zone of physical mixing of river and aquifer water. The results highlight the multi-scale controls that govern the fluid exchange distributions that influence the thickness of the mixing zone between urban rivers and groundwater and the patterns of groundwater flow through the bed of the river. The morphologies of the urban river bed and the adjacent river bank sediments are found to be particularly influential in developing the mixing zone at the interface between river and groundwater. Pressure transients in the river are also found to exert an influence on velocity distribution in the bed material. Areas of significant mixing do not appear to be related to the areas of greatest groundwater discharge and therefore this relationship requires further investigation to quantify the actual remedial capacity of the physical hyporheic zone.

Yet, there is a lack of methods for assessing the spatial extent and distribution of these mixing zones. This study applied time-lapse electrical resistivity (ER) imaging in a 60-m wide and 0.7-m deep alluvial river whose stage periodically varied by 0.7 m due to dam operations to assess dynamic hyporheic mixing and surface water-groundwater interactions. Sixteen channel-spanning repeat ER tomograms (2D sections) over one flood cycle captured the dynamic ER distribution. We mapped a laterally discontinuous hyporheic zone, which had mainly river water circulating through it, several meters into the bed. Underneath the hyporheic zone was a transitional mixing zone intermittently flushed by mixing river water and deep groundwater. Minimally mixed groundwater dominated the deepest areas. ER imaging allows for unraveling hyporheic and deep mixing zone dynamics in large regulated rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000287122400037,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGeoelectrical%2BImaging%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Band%2BMixing%2Bof%2BRiver%2BWater%2Band%2BGroundwater%2Bin%2Ba%2BLarge%2BRegulated%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BBayani%26rft.auinit%3DMB%26rft.aulast%3DCardenas%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes103438a%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D1411%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1407-1411%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1407%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DMarkowski%252C%2BMS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es103438a,,"STREAMBED TOPOGRAPHY,ZONE,CREEK,RESISTIVITY,TOMOGRAPHY,FLUXES",,"Univ Texas Austin, 1 Univ Stn C9000, Austin, TX 78712 USA"

The hyporheos was sampled along a 130-m stretch at depths of 0.3, 0.6 and 1 m in a pool-riffle sequence and a lateral gravel bar. Benthic fauna was collected on each sampling occasion from different locations in the studied sections. Sampling was conducted in two consecutive years (2014 and 2015) at the end of the spring (high waters) and over a 2-month period during the low summer flow. The results indicated that high surface water temperatures may initiate the movement of some taxa into the interstitial habitat, thus supporting the hyporheic refuge hypothesis. In the hyporheic zone, the low oxygen rates recorded deeper in the sediment and in the last low-flow months caused significant declines in taxonomic richness, and lower pH values resulted in a reduction in invertebrate abundances. In the benthic zone, high flow velocities increased richness but decreased invertebrate abundances. A large number of taxa were found in the gravel bar section reflecting the more suitable living conditions in this habitat compared with the river reach (high DO rates).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000559934200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DChanges%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bvertical%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Band%2Bbenthic%2Bfauna%2Bassociated%2Bwith%2Blow%2Bflow%2Bconditions%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bheadwaters%2Bof%2Bthe%2BTafna%2Briver%2B%2528northwest%2BAlgeria%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DZeyneb%26rft.auinit%3DZ%26rft.aulast%3DBenkebil%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10201-020-00635-x%26rft.eissn%3D1439-863X%26rft.epage%3D80%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1439-8621%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D69-80%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D69%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DBenkebil%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DTaleb%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBelaidi%252C%2BN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10201-020-00635-x,"Invertebrate community,Stream,Hyporheic refugee,Drought","NEW-ZEALAND,MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,INVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES,THERMAL TOLERANCES,WATER EXCHANGE,STREAM,RESPONSES,DROUGHT,HABITAT,SURFACE",,"Univ Tlemcen, Lab Ecol & Management Nat Ecosyst LECGEN, BP 119, Tilimsen 13000, Algeria"

Consistently with recent experimental and numerical results, a physically based one-dimensional solute transport model is presented that represents hyporheic mixing as a diffusion process exponentially attenuated with depth. When vertical diffusion in the sediment bed is not limited by an impermeable boundary, the moments of the breakthrough curves (BTCs) generated by the model exhibit persistent non-Fickian behavior and are shown to scale consistently with existing experimental evidence. The ability of the exponentially attenuated mixing model to represent experimental BTCs was tested using data from field and flume tracer experiments, and its performance was compared with that of a classic two-storage zone model. While both models provided an equally good approximation for the BTCs observed in field tracer tests, the exponentially attenuated mixing model provided better fits for the flume experiments. Analysis of the model equations and their solutions shows that, if the flow cross-sectional area and wetted perimeter are not predetermined, there are infinite sets of parameter values that produce the same space-time concentration distributions. The result implies that the physical parameters of hyporheic exchange cannot be determined by sole measurements of the solute BTCs in the surface water unless flow cross-sectional area and average flow depth can be independently estimated.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000543939800090,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bthe%2BEffect%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BMixing%2Bon%2BStream%2BSolute%2BTransport%26rft.aufirst%3DAndrea%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DBottacin-Busolin%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025697%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D10011%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D9995-10011%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D9995%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR025697,,"TRANSIENT STORAGE,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,EXCHANGE,BED,TURBULENCE,FLOW,BEHAVIOR,RIVERS,SCALE",,"Univ Manchester, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England"
39,39,"Boano, F",Jul 27 2010 ,A linear model for the coupled surface-subsurface flow in a meandering stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The interest about the exchange of water between streams and aquifers has been increasing among the hydrologic community because of the implications of the exchange of heat, solutes, and colloids for the water quality of aquatic environments. Unfortunately, our understanding of the relevance of the exchange processes is limited by the great number of coupled hydrological and geomorphological factors that interact to generate the complex spatial patterns of exchange. In this context, the present work presents a mathematical model for the surface-subsurface exchange through the streambed of a meandering stream. The model is based on the linearization of the equations that govern the hydrodynamics and the morphodynamics of the system, and it provides a first-order analytical solution of the coupled flow field of both the surface and the subsurface flows. The results show that stream curvature determines a characteristic spatial pattern of hyporheic exchange, with water upwelling and downwelling concentrated near the stream banks. The exchange can drive surface water deep into the sediments, thus keeping deep alluvium regions connected with the stream. The relationships between hyporheic exchange flux and the geometrical and hydrodynamical properties of the stream-aquifer system are also investigated.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000280591000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW07535%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Blinear%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bcoupled%2Bsurface-subsurface%2Bflow%2Bin%2Ba%2Bmeandering%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DFulvio%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DBoano%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009WR008317%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DBoano%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DCamporeale%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DRevelli%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2009WR008317,,"HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,UPSTREAM INFLUENCE,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,WATER,SOLUTES,ZONE,DOWNSTREAM,CHANNEL",,"Politecn Torino, Dept Hydraul Transports & Civil Infrastruct, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy"

A tracer injection experiment using bromide (Br-) was conducted in the stream system. Simulations with a transport model showed that rates of exchange between the stream and hyporheic zone were rapid (alpha approximate to 10(-3) s(-1)). Parallel factor analysis of fluorescence spectra was used to quantify the redox state of dissolved fulvic acids. The rate coefficient for oxidation of reduced fulvic acids (lambda = 6.5 x 10(-3) s(-1)) in the stream indicates that electron-transfer reactions occur over short time scales. The rate coefficients for decay of ammonium (lambda = 1.2 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and production of nitrate (lambda = -1.0 x 10(-3) s(-1)) were opposite in sign but almost equal in magnitude.

41,41,"Menichino, GT",Oct 2015 ,The effect of macropores on bi-directional hydrologic exchange between a stream channel and riparian groundwater,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Macropores and soil pipes in stream banks are common geomorphic features. Macropores and soil pipes that are open to the channel (i.e. ""bank face-connected"" macropores) are inundated when channel stage is elevated (e.g., from precipitation, snowmelt, dam release). However, previous studies have not investigated macropore impact on bi-directional water exchange between the channel and bank/riparian groundwater under variable hydrologic conditions. We monitored two transects of riparian groundwater wells perpendicular to the bank of a 2nd order stream for a year: one with bank face-connected macropores (M transect) and one without bank face-connected macropores (NM transect). Fluctuations in water level and temperature during storms in those wells closest to the channel were on average 139% and 29% higher, respectively, in the presence of macropores. Rising head tests in the same wells indicated that hydraulic conductivity was 61-140 times higher in the presence of macropores. Bank storage, indicated by gradient reversals between channel and riparian zone, occurred on two temporal scales. Bank storage during storms was more frequent in the M transect (occurred all year) than in the NM transect (occurred just in winter and spring). Smaller magnitude gradient reversals at the M transect are consistent with faster head equilibration and greater exchange volume. Bank storage also occurred on an annual basis, with channel water entering storage during summer and fall and returning to the channel during winter and spring. Taken together, these results suggest that macropores act as preferential flow paths that enhance the connectivity between channels and riparian groundwater that influences bank storage. Where bank macropores are present, conceptual models of hyporheic and groundwater flow should account for their effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the potential removal of nitrate (NO3-) from surface and ground water sources, the spatial variations in dinitrogen (N-2) gas concentrations and direct measurements of sediment denitrification potential (DNP), with amended NO3- and carbon (C) treatments, were investigated in the summer along a 95-km reach of the San Joaquin River. Excess N-2 in hyporheic porewaters ranged from <0.1 to 8.65 mg L-1 and was significantly higher in porewaters from the 1.3 m (ground water source) versus 0.3 m (mixed surface and ground water) depths. In deep groundwater wells (3-7 m), median excess N-2 concentration was 5.39 mg L-1 (range = <0.1 -14.6 mg L-1). Excess N-2 concentrations were inversely correlated with dissolved oxygen and NO3- concentrations suggesting denitrification as an important process in the dominantly anaerobic sediments. Hyporheic porewater NO3- concentrations exceeded the detection limit of 0.01 mg L-1 in only 20% of the hyporheic porewaters, in spite of high NO3- concentrations measured in both surface waters (mean = 2.25 mg N L-1) and surrounding groundwaters. Sediment DNP rates averaged 253 and 297 mu g N kg(-1) hr(-1) for NO3- amended, and NO3- + C amended sediments, respectively, supporting the prevalence of denitrification in hyporheic sediments.

43,43,"Radspinner, RR",Dec 2010 ,River Training and Ecological Enhancement Potential Using In-Stream Structures,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING,"The use of in-stream flow training structures for channel stabilization has become increasingly popular due to its potential cost effectiveness and ecological benefits. When properly designed and maintained, these structures help to protect the channel from erosion and lateral migration and may also provide grade control. Additionally, in-stream structures may improve fish and macroinvertebrate habitat and increase hyporheic exchange. However, a large number of these projects fail due to inadequate design guidelines. In this study, various types of in-stream sill and deflector structures are described. A literature review including case studies, journal articles, and standards developed by various agencies suggests design guidelines which are currently available but do not meet the rigorous engineering-based hydraulic design criteria necessary for success. A practitioner opinion survey of personnel from state agencies, federal agencies, and private firms indicates that these structures are being used extensively in at least 76% of the USGS physiographic provinces. In general, respondents indicated that in the areas of cost, performance, maintenance, and environmental enhancement in-stream structures are preferable to the most common alternative: riprap revetment. Information from 39 case studies suggests that successful projects involve multiple structures and are located in rivers with relatively high aspect ratios.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000284276300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiver%2BTraining%2Band%2BEcological%2BEnhancement%2BPotential%2BUsing%2BIn-Stream%2BStructures%26rft.aufirst%3DR.%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DRR%26rft.aulast%3DRadspinner%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HY.1943-7900.0000260%26rft.eissn%3D1943-7900%26rft.epage%3D980%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9429%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D967-980%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D967%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D136%26rft.au%3DRadspinner%252C%2BRR%26rft.au%3DDiplas%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DSotiropoulos%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000260,"Stream stability,Stream restoration,Infrastructure protection","SUBMERGED VANES,SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT,FLOW STRUCTURE,RESTORATION,RIFFLES,SCOUR,REHABILITATION",,"Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Baker Environm Hydraul Lab, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
44,44,"Harvey, JW",Aug 1996 ,Evaluating the reliability of the stream tracer approach to characterize stream-subsurface water exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream water was locally recharged into shallow groundwater flow paths that returned to the stream (hyporheic exchange) in St. Kevin Gulch, a Rocky Mountain stream in Colorado contaminated by acid mine drainage. Two approaches were used to characterize hyporheic exchange: sub-reach-scale measurement of hydraulic heads and hydraulic conductivity to compute streambed fluxes (hydrometric approach) and reach-scale modeling of in-stream solute tracer injections to determine characteristic length and timescales of exchange with storage zones (stream tracer approach). Subsurface data were the standard of comparison used to evaluate the reliability of the stream tracer approach to characterize hyporheic exchange. The reach-averaged hyporheic exchange flux (1.5 mL s(-1) m(-1)), determined by hydrometric methods, was largest when stream base flow was low (10 L s(-1)); hyporheic exchange persisted when base flow was 10-fold higher, decreasing by approximately 30%. Reliability of the stream tracer approach to detect hyporheic exchange was assessed using first-order uncertainty analysis that considered model parameter sensitivity. The stream tracer approach did not reliably characterize hyporheic exchange at high base flow: the model was apparently more sensitive to exchange with surface water storage zones than with the hyporheic zone. At low base flow the stream tracer approach reliably characterized exchange between the stream and gravel streambed (timescale of hours) but was relatively insensitive to slower exchange with deeper alluvium (timescale of tens of hours) that was detected by subsurface measurements. The stream tracer approach was therefore not equally sensitive to all timescales of hyporheic exchange. We conclude that while the stream tracer approach is an efficient means to characterize surface-subsurface exchange, future studies will need to more routinely consider decreasing sensitivities of tracer methods at higher base flow and a potential bias toward characterizing only a fast component of hyporheic exchange. Stream tracer models with multiple rate constants to consider both fast exchange with streambed gravel and slower exchange with deeper alluvium appear to be warranted.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1996VA83400010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluating%2Bthe%2Breliability%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bstream%2Btracer%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Bcharacterize%2Bstream-subsurface%2Bwater%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DJW%26rft.auinit%3DJW%26rft.aulast%3DHarvey%26rft.date%3D1996%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F96WR01268%26rft.epage%3D2451%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2441-2451%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2441%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DWagner%252C%2BBJ%26rft.au%3DBencala%252C%2BKE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/96WR01268,,"TRANSIENT STORAGE MODEL,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,MOUNTAIN STREAM,GROUNDWATER,FLOW,RIVER,SEDIMENT,AQUIFER,CALIFORNIA",,"US GEOL SURVEY,DIV WATER RESOURCES,430 NATL CTR,RESTON,VA, USA"
45,45,"Butturini, A",May 1999 ,Importance of transient storage zones for ammonium and phosphate retention in a sandy-bottom Mediterranean stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The ability of hyporheic sediments to exchange water and retain ammonium and phosphate in the Riera Major stream,North-East Spain, under different discharge conditions was measured by conducting short-term nutrient and chloride additions.2. The mean exchange coefficients from free-flowing water to the storage zone (k(1)) and vice versa (k(2)) were 0.82 x 10(-4) s(-1) and 7 x 10(-3) s(-1), respectively. The ratio of storage zone cross-sectional area to stream cross-sectional area (A(S)/A) averaged 2.8 x 10-2 and was negatively correlated with discharge (r = -0.85, d.f. = 13, P < 0.001).3. The percentage of hyporheic zone water which came from surface water varied as a function of discharge and hyporheic depth, ranging between 33% and 95% at 25 cm depth, and between 78% and 100% at 10 cm depth.4. The nutrient retention efficiency in the hyporheic zone at 10 cm depth measured as uptake length (S-wh) was less than 3.3 cm for ammonium and 37 cm for phosphate. Higher nutrient retentions were measured in the sediments at 10 cm depth than at 25 cm, indicating that near-surface sediments were involved more actively in phosphate retention than the deeper hyporheic sediments. The lack of ammonium at any depth of the hyporheic zone showed that ammonium was very rapidly taken up in the surfacial sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000081362000011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImportance%2Bof%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bzones%2Bfor%2Bammonium%2Band%2Bphosphate%2Bretention%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsandy-bottom%2BMediterranean%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DButturini%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.1999.00406.x%26rft.epage%3D603%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D593-603%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D593%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DButturini%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSabater%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00406.x,"hyporheic zone,Mediterranean stream,nutrient retention,transient storage","HYPORHEIC ZONE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS,HEADWATER STREAMS,WATER EXCHANGE,DYNAMICS,GROUNDWATER,ECOSYSTEMS,CHANNEL",,"Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, Avgda Diagonal 645, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain"
46,46,"Packman, A",Jul 2004 ,Hyporheic exchange with gravel beds: Basic hydrodynamic interactions and bedform-induced advective flows,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Stream-subsurface exchange processes are important because of their role in controlling the transport of contaminants and ecologically relevant substances in streams. Laboratory flume experiments were conducted to examine solute exchange with gravel streambeds. Two morphologies were studied: flat beds and beds covered by dune-shaped bedforms. High rates of exchange were observed with flat beds under a wide range of stream flow conditions, indicating that there was considerable turbulent coupling of stream and pore water flows. The presence of bedforms produced additional exchange under all flow conditions. The exchange with bedforms could be represented well by considering solute flux caused by bedform-induced advective pumping. Pumping exchange was enhanced by inertial effects, including non-Darcy flow and turbulent diffusion. For the flat bed case, dye injections showed that exchange also occurred by a combination of advective pore water flow and turbulent diffusion near the stream-subsurface interface. The relative effects of advective and diffusive transport processes could not be separated due to the complex nature of the induced flows in the gravel bed. However, exchange was found to scale with the square of the stream Reynolds number in all cases. Comparison of these results with those obtained with coarser and finer sediments demonstrated that the exchange rate is also proportional to the square of the characteristic bed sediment size. These scaling relationships can be used to,improve interpretation of solute transport observed in natural rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000222249500007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bwith%2Bgravel%2Bbeds%253A%2BBasic%2Bhydrodynamic%2Binteractions%2Band%2Bbedform-induced%2Badvective%2Bflows%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DPackman%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9429%25282004%2529130%253A7%2528647%2529%26rft.epage%3D656%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9429%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BENGINEERING-ASCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D647-656%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D647%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BENG-ASCE%26rft.volume%3D130%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSalehin%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DZaramella%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+ENGINEERING-ASCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2004)130:7(647),"streambeds,streams,porous media,turbulent diffusion,pore water,interfaces","LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,STREAM,TRANSPORT,SEDIMENTS,FORMS,RIVERS,MODEL",,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"
47,47,"Varricchione, JT",Dec 2005 ,Vertical and seasonal distribution of hyporheic invertebrates in streams with different glacial histories,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"We investigated the vertical, lateral, and seasonal distribution of hyporheic invertebrates at five stream sites in Idaho (unglaciated areas) and seven sites in Montana (glaciated areas), U.S.A. Conservative tracer releases and transient storage zone analyses were conducted to help characterize study sites. Hyporheic invertebrates and substrate were sampled by freeze-coring with electro-shocking, and mini-piezometers were used to measure other hyporheic conditions, including vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG). Wells were installed at some Montana sites (range: 5-175 m lateral to the channel) and shallow pits were excavated at some Idaho sites (5 m lateral to the channel) to sample hyporheic invertebrates in these saturated sediments regions. Environmental conditions varied widely among sites and between surface and hyporheic zones at each site, and most hyporheic habitat measures differed significantly between glaciated and unglaciated streams. In-channel invertebrate density and taxa richness generally decreased with increasing depth into the streambed, regardless of geographic location, history of glaciation, or season. Although hyporheic invertebrate mean density and (to a lesser extent) richness values at individual depth layers (e.g., 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm) mostly were greater in the glaciated region than the unglaciated region, density and richness between 10-50 cm did not differ significantly between the two regions. Hydrologic variables (VHG; A(S)/A [ratio of transient-storage-zone- to channel- cross-sectional areas]; TTS [turnover time of storage]; and R-h [hydraulic retention factor]) provided the best explanation for differences in sub-channel invertebrate density and richness patterns. The observation that benthic invertebrates occurred in freeze-core, well, and open-pit samples contributes to existing evidence that aquatic invertebrates occupy habitats that extend considerable distances from the active channel.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000233867700005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVertical%2Band%2Bseasonal%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Binvertebrates%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Bwith%2Bdifferent%2Bglacial%2Bhistories%26rft.aufirst%3DJT%26rft.auinit%3DJT%26rft.aulast%3DVarricchione%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-005-0784-3%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D453%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D434-453%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D434%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D67%26rft.au%3DVarricchione%252C%2BJT%26rft.au%3DThomas%252C%2BSA%26rft.au%3DMinshall%252C%2BGW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00027-005-0784-3,"vertical hydrologic exchange,transient storage zone,hyporheos,glaciated,unglaciated","SURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,ALLUVIAL RIVERS,FAUNA,COMMUNITIES,SEDIMENT,ZONES,MACROINVERTEBRATES,PERSPECTIVE",,"Maine Dept Environm Protect, 312 Canco Rd, Portland, ME 04103 USA"
48,48,"Larsen, LG",Jan 2014 ,Dynamic hyporheic exchange at intermediate timescales: Testing the relative importance of evapotranspiration and flood pulses,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic fluxes influence ecological processes across a continuum of timescales. However, few studies have been able to characterize hyporheic fluxes and residence time distributions (RTDs) over timescales of days to years, during which evapotranspiration (ET) and seasonal flood pulses create unsteady forcing. Here we present a data-driven, particle-tracking piston model that characterizes hyporheic fluxes and RTDs based on measured vertical head differences. We used the model to test the relative influence of ET and seasonal flood pulses in the Everglades (FL, USA), in a manner applicable to other low-energy floodplains or broad, shallow streams. We found that over the multiyear timescale, flood pulses that drive relatively deep (approximate to 1 m) flow paths had the dominant influence on hyporheic fluxes and residence times but that ET effects were discernible at shorter timescales (weeks to months) as a break in RTDs. Cumulative RTDs on either side of the break were generally well represented by lognormal functions, except for when ET was strong and none of the standard distributions applied to the shorter timescale. At the monthly timescale, ET increased hyporheic fluxes by 1-2 orders of magnitude; it also decreased 6 year mean residence times by 53-87%. Long, slow flow paths driven by flood pulses increased 6 year hyporheic fluxes by another 1-2 orders of magnitude, to a level comparable to that induced over the short term by shear flow in streams. Results suggest that models of intermediate-timescale processes should include at least two-storage zones with different RTDs, and that supporting field data collection occur over 3-4 years.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000331798800023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDynamic%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bat%2Bintermediate%2Btimescales%253A%2BTesting%2Bthe%2Brelative%2Bimportance%2Bof%2Bevapotranspiration%2Band%2Bflood%2Bpulses%26rft.aufirst%3DLaurel%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DLG%26rft.aulast%3DLarsen%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR014195%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D335%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D318-335%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D318%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DLarsen%252C%2BLG%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DMaglio%252C%2BMM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR014195,"hyporheic zone,effective diffusion,transient storage,residence times","TRANSIENT STORAGE MODEL,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,CONCENTRATION PROFILES,MOUNTAIN STREAM,BED FORMS,WATER,ZONE,EVERGLADES,RIVER",,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, 507 McCone Hall, Berkeley, CA 94710 USA"

Among spawning tributary streams, the abundance of bull trout redds increased with increased area of alluvial valley segments that were longitudinally confined by geomorphic knickpoints. Among all valley segment types, bull trout redds were primarily found in these bounded alluvial valley segments, which possessed complex patterns of hyporheic exchange and extensive upwelling zones. Bull trout used stream reaches for spawning that were strongly influenced by upwelling. However, within these selected reaches, bull trout redds were primarily located in transitional bedforms that possessed strong localized downwelling and high intragravel flow rates. The changing relationship of spawning habitat selection, in which bull trout selected upwelling zones at one spatial scale and downwelling zones at another spatial scale, emphasizes the importance of considering multiple spatial scales within a hierarchical geomorphic context when considering the ecology of this species or plans for bull trout conservation and restoration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000087780700015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGeomorphology%252C%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%252C%2Band%2Bselection%2Bof%2Bspawning%2Bhabitat%2Bby%2Bbull%2Btrout%2B%2528Salvelinus%2Bconfluentus%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DCV%26rft.auinit%3DCV%26rft.aulast%3DBaxter%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252Ff00-056%26rft.eissn%3D1205-7533%26rft.epage%3D1481%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1470-1481%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1470%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DBaxter%252C%2BCV%26rft.au%3DHauer%252C%2BFR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E5Avk58TK7W3r1vskSv3t2&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1139/f00-056,,"ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE,RIVER CONTINUUM,STREAM,GROUNDWATER,FISH,FONTINALIS,PATTERNS,ECOLOGY,ZONES,WATER",,"Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA"
