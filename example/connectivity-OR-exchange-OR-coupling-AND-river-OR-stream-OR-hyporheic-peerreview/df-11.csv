0,"Endreny, T",Feb 12 2011 ,Hyporheic flow path response to hydraulic jumps at river steps: Flume and hydrodynamic models,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The conceptual model of hyporheic exchange below river steps may oversimplify exchange flow paths if it depicts a uniform pattern of downstream-directed upwelling. This research used nonmobile, porous bed flume experiments and hydrodynamic simulation (CFD) to characterize hyporheic flow paths below a river step with a hydraulic jump. Bed slope was 1%, step height was 4 cm, downstream flow depth was 4 cm, substrate was 1 cm median diameter gravel, and hydraulic jump length was 25 cm in the flume and CFD experiments. With the hydraulic jump, flow paths changed to include downwelling beneath the water plunging into the pool and upstream-directed upwelling at the base of the step and beneath the length of jump. Failure to represent the influence of static and dynamic pressures associated with hydraulic jumps leads to erroneous prediction of subsurface flow paths in 75% of the streambed beneath the jump. A refined conceptual model for hyporheic flow paths below a step with a hydraulic jump includes reversed hyporheic circulation cells, in which downwelling water moves upstream and then upwells, and flow reversals, in which the larger flow net of downstream-directed upwelling encounters a nested flow path of upstream-directed upwelling. Heterogeneity in hyporheic flow paths at hydraulic jumps has the potential to explain field-observed mosaics in streambed redox patterns and expand structure-function relationships used in river management and restoration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000287327200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW02517%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bflow%2Bpath%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Bhydraulic%2Bjumps%2Bat%2Briver%2Bsteps%253A%2BFlume%2Band%2Bhydrodynamic%2Bmodels%26rft.aufirst%3DT.%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DEndreny%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009WR008631%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DLautz%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DSiegel%252C%2BDI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Crenshaw, CL",Apr 2010 ,Dissolved inorganic nitrogen dynamics in the hyporheic zone of reference and human-altered southwestern U. S. streams,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Canalization and incision are common morphological alterations associated with human land use that reduce hydrological/hydrodynamic linkages between surface and ground waters in stream ecosystems. To explore the impacts of these anthropogenic changes on nutrient spiraling in streams, we measured the linkage between hyporheic and surface zones of reference and human-altered streams using N-15-nitrate ((NO3-)-N-15) and bromide (Br-) tracer injection experiments. Experiments were conducted in 7 streams (3 reference, 3 agricultural and 1 urban) in Arizona and New Mexico, USA, over a 3 yr period during the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX II). Groundwater wells (6-9 in each stream) were inserted to 30 cm depth and multilevel samplers (MLS) were installed downstream from injection sites to measure inorganic nitrogen (N) and Br- concentrations in hyporheic water. There was measurable surface water-ground water (SW-GW) connectivity, as indicated by Br- concentrations in shallow alluvial ground water (0-30 cm depth) at all sites. SW-GW connectivity was higher in reference than in human-altered streams. Concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in MLS cells (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm below streambed) were inversely correlated, and N-15-enrichment of both N species was measurable in groundwater wells. Hyporheic zones with lower surface-water infiltration had higher quantities of (NH4+)-N-15 than of (NO3-)-N-15. Whole stream uptake (k(tot); calculated during the LINX II experiments) was correlated with delta(NH4+)-N-15 in wells; i.e., high delta(NH4+)-N-15 in wells was associated with high stream uptake, and both whole stream NO3- uptake and delta(NH4+)-N-15 were highest in the human-altered streams. The presence of enriched (NH4+)-N-15 in many of the wells within 24 h of injection suggested that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was occurring in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000281759300009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDissolved%2Binorganic%2Bnitrogen%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Breference%2Band%2Bhuman-altered%2Bsouthwestern%2BU.%2BS.%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DCL%26rft.aulast%3DCrenshaw%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F1863-9135%252F2010%252F0176-0391%26rft.epage%3D405%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D391-405%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D391%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D176%26rft.au%3DCrenshaw%252C%2BCL%26rft.au%3DGrimm%252C%2BNB%26rft.au%3DPershall%252C%2BAD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
2,"Ferencz, SB",Nov 2021 ,Aerobic respiration in riparian exchange zones of regulated river corridors,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"River stage fluctuations drive surface water-groundwater exchanges within river corridors. This study evaluates how repeated daily stage fluctuations, representative of hydropeaking conditions, influence aerobic respiration of river-sourced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the riparian exchange zone using reactive flow and transport simulations. Over 50 hypothetical scenarios were modelled to evaluate how the duration of the daily flood signal, river DOC concentration, aquifer hydraulic conductivity and ambient groundwater flow condition affect the fate and transport of DOC and DO in the riparian aquifer. Time series subsurface snapshots highlight how the various factors influence the subsurface distribution of DOC and DO. The total mass of DOC respired per meter of river had a wide range depending on the parameters, spanning from 1.4 to 71 g over 24-h, with high hydraulic conductivity and losing ambient groundwater flow conditions favouring the largest amount of DOC respired. The ratio of DOC mass entering the riparian zone with the mass returning to the river showed that as little as 5% to as much as 76% of the DOC that enters the bank during stage fluctuations returns to the river. This return ratio is dependent on river DOC concentration, hydraulic conductivity and ambient groundwater flow. The results illustrate that stage variations due to river regulation can be a significant control on aerobic respiration in riparian exchange zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000723020900012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14386%26rft.atitle%3DAerobic%2Brespiration%2Bin%2Briparian%2Bexchange%2Bzones%2Bof%2Bregulated%2Briver%2Bcorridors%26rft.aufirst%3DStephen%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DFerencz%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14386%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DFerencz%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DNeilson%252C%2BBT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

This included the drawing of potentiometric maps, measuring hydraulic conductivity and porosity, and the monthly analysis of major chemical elements in water samples.Use of the combined data led to the clarification of certain aspects of the characteristics, functioning and development of the hyporheic zone.Even though the area studied lies in a zone of groundwater recharge, the direct vertical exchange between surface-and groundwater does not seem to be determinant in the potentiometric and chemical development of the area. However, the state of reserves, which can be reduced or reconstituted, seems to play an essential role in flow dynamics, and thus of the chemistry of this area. Flow dynamics in the hyporheic zone apparently are of the longitudinal-transversal type, related to the local stream morphology.The results show how difficult it is to define the hyporheic zone in a structural sense, even though the zone represents an entity that is clearly characterized by specific and identifiable dynamics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1997YC64000006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2BHydrogeological%2Band%2Bgeochemical%2Bstudy%2Bof%2Ba%2Bstream%2Bin%2Bthe%2BPyrenees%2BMountains%26rft.aufirst%3DR%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DRouch%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Firoh.19970820310%26rft.epage%3D378%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0020-9309%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONALE%2BREVUE%2BDER%2BGESAMTEN%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D357-378%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D357%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BREV%2BGES%2BHYDROBIO%26rft.volume%3D82%26rft.au%3DRouch%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DMangin%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DDHulst%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONALE+REVUE+DER+GESAMTEN+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Ciszewski, D",2019 ,Groundwater Chemistry in a Meander Bend of the Polluted Biala Przemsza River,POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,"Groundwater chemistry in alluvia was investigated in a meander bend of the Biala Przemsza River in its middle course at Slawkow in Upper Silesia, southern Poland. Pollution of groundwater induced by inflow of river water enabled recognition of relative differences in the amount of inflowing water. Biogeochemical zonation is a characteristic feature of the investigated groundwater. Inflow of river water is most intensive in the zone of about 1/3 of the bend width, parallel to the channel. It is characterized by macroions concentrations higher than that in the river. Outside, in the central part of the bend, concentrations of macroions significantly decrease. In this part of the bend, the largest head gradient also is observed. It increases toward the apex, and close to the river channel it equals about 40 cm. Groundwaters in the distal part of the bend are the least mineralized as a result of dilution by rain water. Investigations suggest a slow exchange of the hyporheic waters because of the prevalence of sandy-silty sediments. It favours transformation of nitrates, sulphates, and iron mobility in reducing conditions. Reducing their load in the river can be remarkable over the 30 km meandering reach of this river.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000461800200056,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater%2BChemistry%2Bin%2Ba%2BMeander%2BBend%2Bof%2Bthe%2BPolluted%2BBiala%2BPrzemsza%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DDariusz%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DCiszewski%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.15244%252Fpjoes%252F86220%26rft.eissn%3D2083-5906%26rft.epage%3D1611%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1230-1485%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DPOLISH%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BSTUDIES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1601-1611%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1601%26rft.stitle%3DPOL%2BJ%2BENVIRON%2BSTUD%26rft.volume%3D28&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=POLISH+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+STUDIES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"Zhou, T",Sep 2017 ,A New Approach to Quantify Shallow Water Hydrologic Exchanges in a Large Regulated River Reach,WATER,"Hydrologic exchange is a crucial component of the water cycle. The strength of the exchange directly affects the biogeochemical and ecological processes that occur in the hyporheic zone and aquifer from micro to reach scales. Hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) can be quantified using many field measurement approaches, however, in a relatively large river (scale >10(3) m), these approaches are limited by site accessibility, the difficulty of performing representative sampling, and the complexity of geomorphologic features and subsurface properties. In rivers regulated by hydroelectric dams, quantifying HEF rates becomes more challenging because of frequent hydropeaking events, featuring hourly to daily variations in flow and river stages created by dam operations. In this study, we developed and validated a new approach based on field measurements to estimate shallow water HEF rates across the river bed along the shoreline of the Columbia River, USA. Vertical thermal profiles measured by self-recording thermistors were combined with time series of hydraulic gradients derived from river stages and inland water levels to estimate the HEF rates. The results suggest that the HEF rates had high spatial and temporal heterogeneities over the riverbed, with predicted flux rates varied from +1 x 10(-6) m s(-1) to -1.5 x 10(6) m s(-1) under different flow conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000411567200076,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B703%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BNew%2BApproach%2Bto%2BQuantify%2BShallow%2BWater%2BHydrologic%2BExchanges%2Bin%2Ba%2BLarge%2BRegulated%2BRiver%2BReach%26rft.aufirst%3DTian%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DZhou%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw9090703%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BMY%26rft.au%3DZachara%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
6,"Harrison, LR",Nov 2019 ,"Physical Controls on Salmon Redd Site Selection in Restored Reaches of a Regulated, Gravel-Bed River",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Large-scale river restoration programs have emerged recently as a tool for improving spawning habitat for native salmonids in highly altered river ecosystems. Few studies have quantified the extent to which restored habitat is utilized by salmonids, which habitat features influence redd site selection, or the persistence of restored habitat over time. We investigated fall-run Chinook salmon spawning site utilization and measured and modeled corresponding habitat characteristics in two restored reaches: a reach of channel and floodplain enhancement completed in 2013 and a reconfigured channel and floodplain constructed in 2002. Redd surveys demonstrated that both restoration projects supported a high density of salmon redds, 3 and 14 years following restoration. Salmon redds were constructed in coarse gravel substrates located in areas of high sediment mobility, as determined by measurements of gravel friction angles and a grain entrainment model. Salmon redds were located near transitions between pool-riffle bedforms in regions of high predicted hyporheic flows. Habitat quality (quantified as a function of stream hydraulics) and hyporheic flow were both strong predictors of redd occurrence, though the relative roles of these variables differed between sites. Our findings indicate that physical controls on redd site selection in restored channels were similar to those reported for natural channels elsewhere. Our results further highlight that in addition to traditional habitat criteria (e.g., water depth, velocity, and substrate size), quantifying sediment texture and mobility, as well as intragravel flow, provides a more complete understanding of the ecological benefits provided by river restoration projects.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000495817100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPhysical%2BControls%2Bon%2BSalmon%2BRedd%2BSite%2BSelection%2Bin%2BRestored%2BReaches%2Bof%2Ba%2BRegulated%252C%2BGravel-Bed%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DLee%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DLR%26rft.aulast%3DHarrison%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR024428%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D8966%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D8942-8966%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D8942%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DHarrison%252C%2BLR%26rft.au%3DBray%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DDunne%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
7,"Koch, JC",May 21 2011 ,"Simulating unsteady flow, anabranching, and hyporheic dynamics in a glacial meltwater stream using a coupled surface water routing and groundwater flow model",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Flooding affects ecosystems by transporting water and solutes across aquatic-terrestrial interfaces, removing nutrient and organic substrate limitations, and spurring biogeochemical activity. Few studies have considered the influence of flooding on surface water-groundwater interactions. This research examines the temporally variable water storage and exchange in a stream in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica, where diel flood pulses occur due to glacial melt. Several MDV streams display truncated discharge peaks, suggesting water storage between the source glacier and the gauging station. We tested the hypothesis that stream braids and subsurface water storage contribute to the difference between glacial melt and stream outflow hydrographs by constructing a coupled surface water routing and subsurface water flow model. This model routes water into stream braids at high flows and allows this water to infiltrate and return to the stream via subsurface flow paths as flows recede. Our simulation demonstrates the importance of surface-subsurface water interactions in controlling the hydrograph shape. Maximum simulated discharge was sensitive to storage parameters including aquifer depth and the flooding threshold, while minimum discharge was sensitive to hydraulic conductivity. Subsurface storage volume varied by 38% over a diel cycle and stream-subsurface exchange rates varied from 0 to 0.19 m(3) h(-1) m(-1), with exchange from the stream to the subsurface during high flows, and vice versa at low flows. These results underscore how unsteady flow can increase hyporheic interactions and ecosystem productivity, and provide support for maintaining natural stream morphology and flow regimes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000290910500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW05530%26rft.atitle%3DSimulating%2Bunsteady%2Bflow%252C%2Banabranching%252C%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Ba%2Bglacial%2Bmeltwater%2Bstream%2Busing%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2Bsurface%2Bwater%2Brouting%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bflow%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DJC%26rft.aulast%3DKoch%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR009508%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DKoch%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DNeupauer%252C%2BRM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
8,"Shih, WR",Sep 16 2020 ,Hyporheic Exchange Under Undular Flows Over a Coarse Granular Bed,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Undular flows over riffles (standing waves with underlying open-channel flows) facilitate a quality environmental setting for riverine habitats. Understanding their link with hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) is important from eco-hydro-geomorphic perspectives. We conduct refractive index-matched scanning experiments to resolve the exchange between surface and subsurface flows across a coarse granular bed. We show that the HEF includes wave pumping (WP) and grain-scale pumping (GP) components. Mechanistically, the dynamic pressure gradient best explains the HEF on both wave and grain scales. However, due to the underlying open-channel flow, the result exhibits a phase lag compared to the theoretical WP, suggesting a necessary shift from the existing water surface-based model to a pressure gradient-based approach. Quantitatively, with the present experimental setting, the GP flux is 1 order of magnitude smaller than the WP flux. The relative significance of WP to GP is further increased at higher discharges, indicating potential utility of WP in habitat vitalization.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000572406100028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020GL089114%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BExchange%2BUnder%2BUndular%2BFlows%2BOver%2Ba%2BCoarse%2BGranular%2BBed%26rft.aufirst%3DWuRong%26rft.auinit%3DWR%26rft.aulast%3DShih%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020GL089114%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D17%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DShih%252C%2BWR%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BFC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
9,"Hoagland, B",Jun 2017 ,Hyporheic zone influences on concentration-discharge relationships in a headwater sandstone stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Complex subsurface flow dynamics impact the storage, routing, and transport of water and solutes to streams in headwater catchments. Many of these hydrogeologic processes are indirectly reflected in observations of stream chemistry responses to rain events, also known as concentration-discharge (CQ) relations. Identifying the relative importance of subsurface flows to stream CQ relationships is often challenging in headwater environments due to spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, this study combines a diverse set of methods, including tracer injection tests, cation exchange experiments, geochemical analyses, and numerical modeling, to map groundwater-surface water interactions along a first-order, sandstone stream (Garner Run) in the Appalachian Mountains of central Pennsylvania. The primary flow paths to the stream include preferential flow through the unsaturated zone (""interflow""), flow discharging from a spring, and groundwater discharge. Garner Run stream inherits geochemical signatures from geochemical reactions occurring along each of these flow paths. In addition to end-member mixing effects on CQ, we find that the exchange of solutes, nutrients, and water between the hyporheic zone and the main stream channel is a relevant control on the chemistry of Garner Run. CQ relationships for Garner Run were compared to prior results from a nearby headwater catchment overlying shale bedrock (Shale Hills). At the sandstone site, solutes associated with organo-mineral associations in the hyporheic zone influence CQ, while CQ trends in the shale catchment are affected by preferential flow through hillslope swales. The difference in CQ trends document how the lithology and catchment hydrology control CQ relationships.Plain Language Summary Stream chemistry serves as a fingerprint for the processes that occur in the critical zone, which extends from unweathered bedrock to the top of the tree canopy. The critical zone thus includes all resources critical to life. This paper evaluates chemical and physical processes in the critical zone, specifically in soils, streams, and groundwater. Our work suggests the important influence of groundwater-surface water interactions on mountain streams with an emphasis on the transport of water and solutes through the streambed. By comparing these transport processes on sandstone and shale, we hypothesize that the type of rock underlying a watershed can influence the relative importance of groundwater-surface water interactions on stream chemistry.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000405997000009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bzone%2Binfluences%2Bon%2Bconcentration-discharge%2Brelationships%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bsandstone%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DBeth%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DHoagland%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019717%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4667%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4643-4667%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4643%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DHoagland%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DRusso%252C%2BTA%26rft.au%3DBrantley%252C%2BSL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Ward, AS",Sep 19 2014 ,Spatially distributed characterization of hyporheic solute transport during baseflow recession in a headwater mountain stream using electrical geophysical imaging,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The transport of solutes along hyporheic flowpaths is recognized as central to numerous biogeochemical cycles, yet our understanding of how this transport changes with baseflow recession, particularly in a spatially distributed manner, is limited. We conducted four steady-state solute tracer injections and collected electrical resistivity data to characterize hyporheic transport during seasonal baseflow recession in the RI Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, USA). We used temporal moment analysis of pixels generated from inversion of electrical resistivity data to compress time-lapse data into descriptive statistics (mean arrival time, temporal variance, and temporal skewness) for each pixel. A spatial visualization of these temporal moments in the subsurface at each of five 2-D transects perpendicular to the stream was interpreted to inform transport processes. As baseflow recession progressed we found increasing first arrival times, persistence, mean arrival time, temporal variance, and coefficient of variation, and decreasing skewness. These trends suggest that changes in hydrologic forcing alter the relative influence of transport phenomena (e.g., advection vs. other transport processes such as dispersion) along flowpaths. Spatial coverage obtained from electrical resistivity images allowed for qualitative comparison of spatial patterns in temporal moments both at an individual cross-section as well as between cross sections. We found that geomorphologic controls (e.g., bedrock confinement vs. gravel wedge deposits) resulted in different distributions and metrics of hyporheic transport. Results of this study provide further evidence that hyporheic transport is highly variable both in space and through the baseflow recession period. Geophysical images differentiate advection-dominated flowpaths from those that are more affected by other transport processes (e.g., dispersion, mobile-immobile exchange). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

11,"Haggerty, R",Jul 1 2002 ,Power-law residence time distribution in the hyporheic zone of a 2nd-order mountain stream,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"[1] We measured the hyporheic residence time distribution in a 2nd-order mountain stream at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, and found it to be a power-law over at least 1.5 orders of magnitude in time (1.5 hr to 3.5 d). The residence time distribution has a very long tail which scales as t(-1.28), and is poorly characterized by an exponential model. Because of the small power-law exponent, efforts to characterize the mean hyporheic residence time (t(s))in this system result in estimates that are scale invariant, increasing with the characteristic advection time within the stream channel (t(ad)). The distribution implies the hyporheic zone has a very large range of exchange timescales, with significant quantities of water and solutes stored over timescales very much longer than t(ad). The hyporheic zone in such streams may contribute to short-time fractal scaling in time series of solute concentrations observed in small-watershed studies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000178964300016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1640%26rft.atitle%3DPower-law%2Bresidence%2Btime%2Bdistribution%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2B2nd-order%2Bmountain%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DR%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DHaggerty%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2002GL014743%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DHaggerty%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DJohnson%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
12,"Yao, CC",Aug 2019 ,Field Experiments of Hyporheic Flow Affected by a Clay Lens,WATER,"As a typical water exchange of surface water and groundwater, hyporheic flow widely exists in streambeds and is significantly affected by the characteristics of sediment and surface water. In this study, a low-permeability clay lens was chosen to investigate the influence of the streambed heterogeneity on the hyporheic flow at a river section of the Xin'an River in Anhui Province, China. A 2D sand tank was constructed to simulate the natural streambed including a clay lens under different velocity of surface water velocity. Heat tracing was used in this study. In particular, six analytical solutions based on the amplitude ratio and phase shift of temperatures were applied to calculate the vertical hyporheic flux. The results of the six methods ranged from -102.4 to 137.5 m/day and showed significant spatial differences. In view of the robustness of the calculations and the rationality of the results, the amplitude ratio method was much better than the phase shift method. The existence of the clay lens had a significant influence on the hyporheic flow. Results shows that the vertical hyporheic flux in the model containing a clay lens was lower than that for the blank control, and the discrepancy of the hyporheic flow field on both sides of the lens was obvious. Several abnormal flow velocity zones appeared around the clay lens where the local hyporheic flow was suppressed or generally enhanced. The hyporheic flow fields at three test points had mild changes when the lens was placed in a shallow layer of the model, indicating that the surface water velocity only affect the hyporheic flow slightly. With the increasing depth of the clay lens, the patterns of the hyporheic flow fields at all test points were very close to those of the hyporheic flow field without a clay lens, indicating that the influence of surface water velocity on hyporheic flow appeared gradually. A probable maximum depth of the clay lens was 30 to 40 cm, which approached the bottom of the model and a clay lens buried lower than this maximum would not affect the hyporheic flow any more. Influenced by the clay lens, hyporheic flow was hindered or enhanced in different regions of streambed, which was also depended on the depth of lens and surface water velocity. Introducing a two-dimensional sand tank model in a field test is an attempt to simulate a natural streambed and may positively influence research on hyporheic flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000484561500087,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1613%26rft.atitle%3DField%2BExperiments%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2BAffected%2Bby%2Ba%2BClay%2BLens%26rft.aufirst%3DCongcong%26rft.auinit%3DCC%26rft.aulast%3DYao%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw11081613%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DYao%252C%2BCC%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BCP%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BJY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"Lee, A",May 2020 ,The Sensitivity of Hyporheic Exchange to Fractal Properties of Riverbeds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange in riverbeds is driven by current-bed topography interactions. Because riverbeds exhibit topographic roughness across scales, from individual grains to bedforms and bars, they can exhibit fractal patterns. This study analyzed the influence of fractal properties of riverbed topography on hyporheic exchange. A set of synthetic fractal riverbeds with different scaling statistics was used as inputs to sequentially coupled numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow and hyporheic flow. In the analysis, the maximum power spectrum (dune size) and the fractal dimension (topographic complexity) were considered as independent variables and we then investigated how interfacial fluxes and hyporheic travel times are functionally related to these variables. As the maximum power spectrum increases (i.e., dune height to flow depth ratio), the average interfacial flux increases logarithmically whereas it increases exponentially with an increase in fractal dimension. Hyporheic exchange is more sensitive to additional roughness (larger fractal dimensions) than to bedform size (larger maximum power). Our results imply that fractal properties of riverbeds are crucial to predicting hyporheic exchange. The predictive relationships we propose could be integrated with reduced complexity, large-scale models. They can also be used to design artificial topographies that target hyporheic ecosystem services.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000537736400018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR026560%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BSensitivity%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bto%2BFractal%2BProperties%2Bof%2BRiverbeds%26rft.aufirst%3DAnzy%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DLee%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR026560%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DAubeneau%252C%2BAF%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
14,"Quick, AM",Nov 1 2016 ,Controls on Nitrous Oxide Emissions from the Hyporheic Zones of Streams,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"The magnitude and mechanisms of nitrous oxide (N2O) release from rivers and streams are actively debated. The complex interactions of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical controls on emissions of this important greenhouse gas preclude prediction of when and where N2O emissions will be significant. We present observations from column and large-scale flume experiments supporting an integrative model of N2O emissions from stream sediments. Our results show a distinct, replicable, pattern of nitrous oxide generation and consumption dictated by subsurface (hyporheic) residence times and biological nitrogen reduction rates. Within this model, N2O emission from stream sediments requires subsurface residence times (and microbially mediated reduction rates) be sufficiently long (and fast reacting) to produce N2O by nitrate reduction but also sufficiently short (or slow reacting) to limit N2O conversion to dinitrogen gas. Most subsurface exchange will not result in N2O emissions; only specific, intermediate, residence times (reaction rates) will both produce and release N2O to the stream. We also confirm previous observations that elevated nitrate and declining organic carbon reactivity increase N2O production, highlighting the importance of associated reaction rates in controlling N2O accumulation. Combined, these observations help constrain when N2O release will occur, providing a predictive link between stream geomorphology, hydrodynamics, and N2O emissions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000386991100008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DControls%2Bon%2BNitrous%2BOxide%2BEmissions%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZones%2Bof%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAnnika%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DQuick%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.est.6b02680%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D11500%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D21%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D11491-11500%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D11491%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DQuick%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DReeder%252C%2BWJ%26rft.au%3DBenner%252C%2BSG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
15,"Knapp, JLA",Dec 2018 ,A Critical Assessment of Relating Resazurin-Resorufin Experiments to Reach-Scale Metabolism in Lowland Streams,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"The reactive tracer resazurin is frequently used to investigate metabolic processes and hyporheic exchange in streams, because its transformation to resorufin is considered a function of oxygen turnover in the presence of living cells and thus of ecosystem respiration. This has been investigated and confirmed in a number of laboratory and batch studies but so far not unanimously been verified in the field. In this study we conducted 13 tracer tests with resazurin in different small, low-gradient streams typical of lowland regions. We determined tracer processing rates and ratios based on metrics commonly used to assess reactive-tracer tests with resazurin and compared them to flow characteristics and respiration rates determined from diel-oxygen recordings following a two-station approach. We found no statistical relationship between tracer processing and parameters of transport, indicating that resazurin-to-resorufin transformation cannot be explained by hydrological parameters alone. The statistical relationship between resazurin processing and respiration rates based on diel-oxygen profiles was strongest if resazurin-to-resorufin transformation ratios were used, and uptake lengths were also found to be a good proxy. However, the relationships were not linear, and weak for individual streams, contrary to what was expected based on previous laboratory and batch studies. We attribute this finding to a lack of process understanding of resazurin reactions under field conditions, and generally insignificant hyporheic exchange fluxes in lowland streams. Our findings highlight important limitations of the tracer technique under field conditions.Plain Language Summary Resazurin is a compound that can be used to track the flow of water and metabolic processes in rivers. This has been tested in laboratory experiments before, but until now the method has not been fully verified in the field. In this study we apply resazurin to 13 different small rivers and measure its transformation. We compare our results to other, independent methods that are often used to determine metabolic processes. We find good relationships between the two different methods for all rivers together, but not for individual rivers.

In particular, for a smaller mountain stream where flow is fast and the flow field is irregular (a favorable environment to induce dead zones along the stream), long tails are normally observed in the stream tracer data, and adding transient storage terms in the advection-dispersion transport equation can result in more accurate simulation. While previous studies on transient storage modeling account for temporary, localized exchange between the stream and the shallow groundwater in the hyporheic zone, larger-scale exchange with the groundwater in the underlying aquifer has rarely been included or properly coupled to surface water modeling. In this paper, we complement previous modeling efforts by incorporating the transient storage concept in a conjunctive stream-aquifer model. Three well-documented and widely used USGS models have been coupled to form the core of this conjunctive model: MODFLOW handles the groundwater flow in the aquifer; DAFLOW accurately computes unsteady streamflow by means of the diffusive wave routing technique, as well as stream-aquifer exchange simulated as streambed leakage; and MOOD computes solute transport in the groundwater zone. In addition, an explicit finite difference package was developed to incorporate the one-dimensional transient storage equations for solute transport in streams. The quadratic upstream interpolation (QUICK) algorithm is employed to improve the accuracy of spatial differencing. An adaptive stepsize control algorithm for the Runge-Kutta method is incorporated to increase overall model efficiency. Results show that the conjunctive stream-aquifer model with transient storage can handle well the bank storage effect under a flooding event. When it is applied over a stream network, the results also show that the stream-aquifer interaction acts as a strong source or sink along the stream and is too significant to be ignored. The adaptive stepsize control for stream solute transport improves overall model performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A multiscale investigation of Se biogeochemistry in the hyporheic zone of East Mill Creek (EMC), southeastern Idaho, USA, was performed using in situ surface water and pore water geochemical measurements, a field-based stream tracer test and energy-dependent micro synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (mu-SXRF) measurements of Se speciation in sediments. The active hyporheic zone was determined to be 12 +/- 3 cm. Pore water redox profiles indicated that a transition to suboxic conditions begins at approximately 6 cm. Modeling pore water Se and solid phase analysis suggested Se uptake is occurring. Micro-SXRF analysis of sediments showed reduced elemental Se or selenides throughout the profile and selenite in surface sediments, Field geochemical measurements and microscale analysis both support the hypothesis that reduction in the hyporheic zone promotes sequestration of surface water Se.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000278003500025,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSelenium%2BBiogeochemical%2BCycling%2Band%2BFluxes%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bof%2Ba%2BMining-Impacted%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DLibbie%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DLL%26rft.aulast%3DOram%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes100149u%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D4183%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4176-4183%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4176%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DOram%252C%2BLL%26rft.au%3DStrawn%252C%2BDG%26rft.au%3DMoller%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We studied denitrification in the hyporheic zone and floodplains of an agriculturally influenced headwater stream in Indiana, USA, that had floodplains added as part of a ""two-stage ditch"" restoration project. To examine the potential for N removal in the hyporheic zone, we seasonally measured denitrification rates and nitrate concentrations by depth into the stream sediments. We found that nitrate concentration and denitrification rates declined with depth into the hyporheic zone, but denitrification was still measureable to a depth of at least 20 cm. We also measured denitrification rates on the restored floodplains over the course of a flood (pre, during, and post-inundation), and also compared denitrification rates between vegetated and non-vegetated areas of the floodplain. We found that floodplain denitrification rates increased over the course of a floodplain inundation event, and that the presence of surface water increased denitrification rates when vegetation was present. Stream ecotones in midwestern, agriculturally influenced streams have substantial potential for N removal via denitrification, particularly when they are hydrologically connected with high-nitrate surface water.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000306466000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG00N04%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bconnectivity%2Bincreases%2Bdenitrification%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Band%2Brestored%2Bfloodplains%2Bof%2Ban%2Bagricultural%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DSarah%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DSS%26rft.aulast%3DRoley%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2012JG001950%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D117%26rft.au%3DRoley%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DTank%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DWilliams%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Le Lay, H",Dec 2019 ,Characterization of Diffuse Groundwater Inflows into Stream Water (Part II: Quantifying Groundwater Inflows by Coupling FO-DTS and Vertical Flow Velocities),WATER,"Temperature has been used to characterize groundwater and stream water exchanges for years. One of the many methods used analyzes propagation of the atmosphere-influenced diurnal signal in sediment to infer vertical velocities. However, despite having good accuracy, the method is usually limited by its small spatial coverage. The appearance of fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) provided new possibilities due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. Methods based on the heat-balance equation, however, cannot quantify diffuse groundwater inflows that do not modify stream temperature. Our research approach consists of coupling groundwater inflow mapping from a previous article (Part I) and deconvolution of thermal profiles in the sediment to obtain vertical velocities along the entire reach. Vertical flows were calculated along a 400 m long reach, and a period of 9 months (October 2016 to June 2017), by coupling a fiber optic cable buried in thalweg sediment and a few thermal lances at the water-sediment interface. When compared to predictions of hyporheic discharge by traditional methods (differential discharge between upstream and downstream of the monitored reach and the mass-balance method), those of our method agreed only for the low-flow period and the end of the high-flow period. Our method underestimated hyporheic discharge during high flow. We hypothesized that the differential discharge and mass-balance methods included lateral inflows that were not detected by the fiber optic cable buried in thalweg sediment. Increasing spatial coverage of the cable as well as automatic and continuous calculation over the reach may improve predictions during the high-flow period. Coupling groundwater inflow mapping and vertical hyporheic flow allows flow to be quantified continuously, which is of great interest for characterizing and modeling fine hyporheic processes over long periods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000507378600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2430%26rft.atitle%3DCharacterization%2Bof%2BDiffuse%2BGroundwater%2BInflows%2Binto%2BStream%2BWater%2B%2528Part%2BII%253A%2BQuantifying%2BGroundwater%2BInflows%2Bby%2BCoupling%2BFO-DTS%2Band%2BVertical%2BFlow%2BVelocities%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DHugo%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DLe%2BLay%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw11122430%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DLe%2BLay%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DThomas%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DMoatar%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Brunke, M",Feb 1997 ,The ecological significance of exchange processes between rivers and groundwater,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. This review focuses on the connectivity between river and groundwater ecosystems, viewing them as linked components of a hydrological continuum. Ecological processes that maintain the integrity of both systems and those that are mediated by their ecotones are evaluated.2. The hyporheic zone, as the connecting ecotone, shows diverse gradients. Thus it can be characterized by hydrological, chemical, zoological and metabolic criteria. However, the characteristics of the hyporheic zone tend to vary widely in space and time as well as from system to system. The exact limits are difficult to designate and the construction of static concepts is inadequate for the representation of ecological processes. The hyporheic interstices are functionally a part of both the fluvial and groundwater ecosystems.3. The permeability of the ecotone depends on the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment layers which, because of their heterogeneity, form many flowpath connections between the stream and the catchment, from the small scale of a single microhabitat to the large scale of an entire alluvial aquifer. Local up- and downwellings are determined by geomorphologic features such as streambed topography, whereas large-scale exchange processes are determined mainly by the geological properties of the catchment. Colmation--clogging of the top layer of the channel sediments--includes all processes leading to a reduction of pore volume, consolidation of the sediment matrix, and decreased permeability of the stream bed. Consequently, colmation can hinder exchange processes between surface water and groundwater.4. Physicochemical gradients in the interstices result from several processes: (i) hyporheic flow pattern and the different properties of surface and groundwaters; (ii) retention, caused by the filtering effect of pore size and lithologic sorption as well as the transient storage of solutes caused by diminished water velocities; (iii) biogeochemical transformations in conjunction with local residence time. Each physicochemical parameter may develop its own vertical dynamics laterally from the active channel into the banks as well as longitudinally because of geomorphologic changes.5. The river-groundwater interface can act as a source or sink for dissolved organic matter, depending on the volume and direction of flow, dissolved organic carbon concentrations and biotic activity. Interstitial storage of particulate organic matter is influenced mainly by grain size distribution and by spates involving bedload movement that may import or release matter, depending on the season. After initial transient and abiotic storage, hyporheic organic matter is mobilized and transformed by the biota. Micro-organisms account for over 90% of the community respiration. In subterranean waters most bacteria are attached to surfaces and remain in a biofilm.6. Hyporheic interstices are functionally significant for phreatic and riverine metazoans because they act as a refuge against adverse conditions. The net flow direction exerts a dominant influence on interstitial colonization, but many other factors also seem to be important in structuring the hyporheos.7. The hyporheic corridor concept emphasizes connectivity and interactions between subterranean and surface flow on an ecosystem level for floodplain rivers. It is a complementary concept to others which focus on surficial processes in the lateral and longitudinal dimensions.8. The ecological integrity of groundwater and fluvial systems is often threatened by human activities: (i) by reducing connectivity; (ii) by altering exchange processes; and (iii) by toxic or organic contamination.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1997WJ19200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Becological%2Bsignificance%2Bof%2Bexchange%2Bprocesses%2Bbetween%2Brivers%2Band%2Bgroundwater%26rft.aufirst%3DM%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DBrunke%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.1997.00143.x%26rft.epage%3D33%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1-33%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D37%26rft.au%3DBrunke%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DGonser%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The significance of these biogeochemical `hotspots' to stream and groundwater metabolism is largely controlled by filtration capacity, defined as the extent to which subsurface flowpaths and matrix hydraulic conductivity modify water characteristics. Where hydraulic conductivity is high, gradients in biogeochemistry and microbial activity along subsurface flowpaths were hypothesized to be less marked than where hydraulic conductivity is low. This hypothesis was tested in two riffles and gravel bars in an Australian subtropical stream. At one site, gradients in chemical and microbial variables along flowpaths were associated with reduced hydraulic conductivity, longer water residence time and reduced filtration capacity compared with the second site where filtration capacity was greater and longitudinal biogeochemical trends were dampened. These results imply that factors affecting the sediment matrix in this subtropical stream can alter filtration capacity, interstitial microbial activity and biogeochemical gradients along subsurface flowpaths. This hydroecological approach also indicates potential for a simple field technique to estimate filtration capacity and predict the prevailing hyporheic gradients in microbial activity and biogeochemical processing efficiency, with significant implications for stream ecosystem function.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000262971600012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIntegrating%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bwith%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bgradients%2Band%2Bmicrobial%2Bactivity%2Balong%2Briver-groundwater%2Bexchange%2Bzones%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsubtropical%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DCecile%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DClaret%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-008-0373-3%26rft.epage%3D160%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D151-160%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D151%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DClaret%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Frei, S",Oct 24 2019 ,Occurence of microplastics in the hyporheic zone of rivers,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Although recent studies indicate that fluvial systems can be accumulation areas for microplastics (MPs), the common perception still treats rivers and streams primarily as pure transport vectors for MPs. In this study we investigate the occurrence of MPs in a yet unnoticed but essential compartment of fluvial ecosystems - the hyporheic zone (HZ). Larger MP particles (500-5,000 mu m) were detected using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) - Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Our analysis of MPs (500-5,000 mu m) in five freeze cores extracted for the Roter Main River sediments (Germany) showed that MPs were detectable down to a depth of 0.6 m below the streambed in low abundances (<< 1 particle per kg dry weight). Additionally, one core was analyzed as an example for smaller MPs (20-500 mu m) with focal plane array (FPA)- based mu FTIR spectroscopy. Highest MP abundances (similar to 30,000 particles per kg dry weight) were measured for pore scale particles (20-50 mu m). The detected high abundances indicate that the HZ can be a significant accumulation area for pore scale MPs (20-50 mu m), a size fraction that yet is not considered in literature. As the HZ is known as an important habitat for invertebrates representing the base of riverine food webs, aquatic food webs can potentially be threatened by the presence of MPs in the HZ. Hyporheic exchange is discussed as a potential mechanism leading to a transfer of pore scale MPs from surface flow into streambed sediments and as a potential vector for small MPs to enter the local aquifer. MPs in the HZ therefore may be a potential risk for drinking water supplies, particularly during drinking water production via river bank filtration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000492141700010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B15256%26rft.atitle%3DOccurence%2Bof%2Bmicroplastics%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFrei%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41598-019-51741-5%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2045-2322%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENTIFIC%2BREPORTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BREP-UK%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DFrei%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DPiehl%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DLaforsch%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=SCIENTIFIC+REPORTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
23,"Hussein, M",Aug 2003 ,Modeling of flow and contaminant transport in coupled stream-aquifer systems,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,"This paper describes an integrated approach for modeling flow and contaminant transport in hydraulically connected stream-aquifer systems. The code, FTSTREAM, extended the capabilities of the ground-water model, FTWORK, to incorporate chemical fate and transport in streams. Flow in the stream network is modeled as an unsteady, spatially varying flow, while transport modeling is based on a one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation. In addition to sorption and decay during transport in ground water, the model incorporates volatilization, settling and decay during transport in surface water. The interaction between surface water and ground water is accommodated by a leakage term and is implemented in the model using an iterative Picard-type procedure to ensure mass conservation across the interface between the two systems.The modeling approach is used to simulate contaminant transport in the Mad River, Ohio, which is hydraulically connected to a buried valley aquifer of sand and gravel outwash. The river is a receiving stream in the upstream part of the modeled area. Downstream, heavy pumping from a municipal well field causes the river to become a loosing stream. Induced infiltration from the river is responsible for a considerable portion of the well yield. The flow and transport model, developed for this study, simulates coupling between flow in the aquifer and the river. Hypothetical sources of contamination are introduced at selected locations in the upstream portion of the aquifer. The model is then used to simulate the expected transport in both the aquifer and the stream. A series of simulations elucidates the role of the river in facilitating the transport of the hypothetical contaminants in ground water and surface water. Effect of sorption, retardation and volatilization on contaminant transport is also examined for the case of the volatile organic compounds.

24,"Huang, P",Nov-dec 2018 ,Empirical Equations to Predict the Characteristics of Hyporheic Exchange in a Pool-Riffle Sequence,GROUNDWATER,"The hyporheic zone is the saturated interstitial space surrounding a stream. Water actively moves into, through, and out of the hyporheic zone, resulting in hyporheic exchange (HE), which is crucial to the physicochemical and biological processes in these systems. The HE in pool-riffle sequences is one of the most common forms of HE and has received a vast amount of attention. This study aimed to derive empirical equations to predict the scale, median residence time (RT), and flux of HE in a single pool-riffle sequence by considering stream discharge, bedform geometry, streambed hydraulic conductivity, and groundwater flow. The resulting equations, which were derived using previously published data, allow quick approximations of the mean depth, median RT, and flux of HE in a single pool-riffle sequence. Therefore, these equations can be used to conveniently and efficiently generate insights into the physicochemical and biological processes, facilitating the prediction of water quality and the restoration of HE in stream rehabilitation. The overall framework of the derived equations is also generally applicable to considering HE with additional influential factors (e.g., stream width, sinuosity, bed slope, alluvial depth) and cases with more available data.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000449769000011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEmpirical%2BEquations%2Bto%2BPredict%2Bthe%2BCharacteristics%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bin%2Ba%2BPool-Riffle%2BSequence%26rft.aufirst%3DPeng%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DHuang%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12641%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D958%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D947-958%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D947%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DChui%252C%2BTFM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
25,"Peterson, RN",Jan 20 2010 ,Evaluating groundwater discharge to tidal rivers based on a Rn-222 time-series approach,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"The natural flux of groundwater into coastal water bodies has recently been shown to contribute significant quantities of nutrients and trace metals to the coastal ocean. Groundwater discharge and hyporheic exchange to estuaries and rivers, however, is frequently overlooked though it often carries a distinctly different chemical signature than surface waters. Most studies that attempt to quantify this input to rivers use multiple geochemical tracers. However, these studies are often limited in their spatial and temporal extents because of the labor-intensive nature of integrating multiple measurement techniques. We describe here a method of using a single tracer, Rn-222, to rapidly characterize groundwater discharge into tidally-influenced rivers and streams. In less than one week of fieldwork, we determined that of six streams that empty into the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, three (Eau Gallie River, Turkey Creek, and Main Canal) did not receive substantial groundwater inputs, one canal (C-25 Canal) was dominated by groundwater exchange, and the remaining two (Sebastian River system and Crane Creek) fell somewhere in between. For more detailed discharge assessments, we focused on the Sebastian River system, a stratified tidal river estuary, during a relatively dry period (June) and a wet period July) in 2008. Using time-series 222Rn and current velocity measurements we found that groundwater discharge into all three branches of the Sebastian River increased by 1-2 orders of magnitude during the wetter period. The estimated groundwater flow rates were higher than those reported into the adjacent IRL, suggesting that discharge into these rivers can be more important than direct discharge into the IRL The techniques employed here should work equally well in other river/stream systems that experience significant groundwater discharge. Such assessments would allow area managers to quickly assess the distribution and magnitude of groundwater discharge nature into rivers over large spatial ranges. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

26,"Liu, BJ",Apr 2021 ,Optimal water resources operation for rivers-connected lake under uncertainty,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Due to the complex water system and diversified management requirements, the optimal water resources operation of the rivers-connected lake has always been a difficulty in current researches. Based on the discussion of characteristics of the rivers-connected lake, this paper quantified the forecasting uncertainty in the operation process, and set the quantified uncertainty as the objective function to establish the water resources optimal operation model of rivers-connected lake. The human factors were coupled to the optimal water resources operation in the model, in order to obtain the optimal plan of lake water resources operation with human adaptability. Hongze Lake was taken as an example for the analysis of water resources optimization operation plan of rivers-connected lake. Also, an integrated algorithm including the normal boundary crossing method, the primal-dual interior-point method, and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was proposed to solve the lake operation model. The results proved that the optimization calculation of multi-objective operation under the uncertainty conditions of Hongze Lake can be obtained by the proposed model and algorithm. Uncertainties related to forecasts of lake operation can be effectively reduced by the proposed model, which, thus, implied the obtained operation plan in this paper is more adaptive to changing environment than the existing other plans. The research results can provide technical methods for the lake water resources operation with plentiful and diverse objectives of China and other countries.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000641592600026,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B125863%26rft.atitle%3DOptimal%2Bwater%2Bresources%2Boperation%2Bfor%2Brivers-connected%2Blake%2Bunder%2Buncertainty%26rft.aufirst%3DBojun%26rft.auinit%3DBJ%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.125863%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D595%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BBJ%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BJZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"Knapp, JLA",Jun 2017 ,Determination of hyporheic travel time distributions and other parameters from concurrent conservative and reactive tracer tests by local-in-global optimization,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The complexity of hyporheic flow paths requires reach-scale models of solute transport in streams that are flexible in their representation of the hyporheic passage. We use a model that couples advective-dispersive in-stream transport to hyporheic exchange with a shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times. The model also accounts for two-site sorption and transformation of reactive solutes. The coefficients of the model are determined by fitting concurrent stream-tracer tests of conservative (fluorescein) and reactive (resazurin/resorufin) compounds. The flexibility of the shape-free models give rise to multiple local minima of the objective function in parameter estimation, thus requiring global-search algorithms, which is hindered by the large number of parameter values to be estimated. We present a local-in-global optimization approach, in which we use a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method as global-search method to estimate a set of in-stream and hyporheic parameters. Nested therein, we infer the shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times by a local Gauss-Newton method. The overall approach is independent of the initial guess and provides the joint posterior distribution of all parameters. We apply the described local-in-global optimization method to recorded tracer breakthrough curves of three consecutive stream sections, and infer section-wise hydraulic parameter distributions to analyze how hyporheic exchange processes differ between the stream sections.Plain Language Summary Compounds, dissolved in river water, are transported along the river, but also to some extent into the sediments and back into the river. While being in the sediments, they may react. In reactive stream-tracer tests, we add easy-to-detect reactive compounds into a stream and measure time-series of concentration in the river further downstream. We present an approach of analyzing such tracer tests in a flexible, yet reliable manner, which also provides the uncertainty of our interpretation.

28,"Mendoza-Lera, C",Feb 1 2017 ,Relating hydraulic conductivity and hyporheic zone biogeochemical processing to conserve and restore river ecosystem services,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River management practices commonly attempt to improve habitat and ecological functioning (e.g. biogeochemical processing or retention of pollutants) by restoring hydrological exchange with the hyporheic zone (i.e. hyporheic flow) in an effort to increase mass transfer of solutes (nutrients, carbon and electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrate). However, even when hyporheic flow is increased, often no significant changes in biogeochemical processing are detected. Some of these apparent paradox result from the simplistic assumption that there is a direct relationship between hyporheic flow and biogeochemical processing. We propose an alternative conceptual model that hyporheic flow is non-linearly related with biogeochemical processing. Based on the different solute mass transfer and area available for colonization among hydraulic conductivities, we hypothesize that biogeochemical processing in the hyporheic zone follows a Gaussian function depending on hyporheic hydraulic conductivity. After presenting the conceptual model and its domain of application, we discuss the potential implications, notably for river restoration and further hyporheic research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

29,"Datry, T",2008 ,Lateral and longitudinal patterns within the stygoscape of an alluvial river corridor,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"In landscape ecology, landscapes are viewed as hierarchically-organized groups of interacting components or zones. This perspective is applied in studies of riverscapes with increasing frequency, particularly ill Studies of channel habitats and channel-floodplain interactions. Stygoscapes, the subsurface portions of riverscapes, have received less attention. Stygoscapes are composed of three saturated zones beneath and lateral to river channels: the hyporheic, parafluvial and riparian zones. These zones are differentiated oil the basis of hydrological, biological and chemical conditions, and the degree of interaction with the channel surface. In this paper, we describe lateral and longitudinal patterns in the shallow (30 cm - 10 m depth) stygoscape of the alluvial Selwyn River, New Zealand. We used abutting hyporheic, parafluvial and riparian zones in large-scale downwelling (losing) and upwelling (gaining) sections of the river mainstem to compare physico-chemical and biological conditions across a broad stygoscape. The stygoscape zones had the same arrangement in both sections: hyporheic zones within the wetted channel, riparian zones furthest front the channel, and parafluvial zones between the hyporheic and riparian zones. Nitrate and dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations and electrical conductivity were significantly higher, and dissolved organic phosphorus concentrations and pH levels lower, in the gaining section than the losing section. In both Sections, ammonium, dissolved reactive phosphorus, and dissolved organic cat-boil concentrations and pH were higher in the hyporheic zone than the riparian zone. Within the losing section, DON and DOP concentrations were higher in the hyporheic zone than the riparian zone. Physico-chemical conditions were intermediate in the parafluvial zones of both river sections. These among-zone differences Suggest that hyporheic zones are sinks for dissolved nutrients, and that effects of hyporheic sinks are greatest in losing river sections with unidirectional flow front the surface to the hyporheic zone. There were large differences among stygoscape zones in invertebrate assemblage composition, and smaller differences between the losing and gaining sections. Invertebrate densities, taxon richness and % insect taxa were higher in hyporheic zones than riparian zones. Invertebrate densities were intermediate in the parafluvial zones, and taxon richness and % insect taxa were similar in parafluvial and riparian zones. The spatial patterns we observed in the Selwyn River suggest that hydrological connectivity between zones, and permeability within zones, are among the most important determinants of chemical and biological dynamics in stygoscapes. Differences in large-scale upwelling and downwelling, and differences in water Source (runoff and groundwater) appeared to be of secondary importance.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000258132200007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLateral%2Band%2Blongitudinal%2Bpatterns%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Bstygoscape%2Bof%2Ban%2Balluvial%2Briver%2Bcorridor%26rft.aufirst%3DThibault%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DDatry%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F1863-9135%252F2008%252F0171-0335%26rft.epage%3D347%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D335-347%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D335%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D171%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DScarsbrook%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DFenwick%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
30,"Cornut, J",2012 ,Coarse particulate organic matter in the interstitial zone of three French headwater streams,ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"Headwater woodland streams are primarily heterotrophic: they receive substantial inputs of organic matter from the riparian vegetation, while autochthonous primary production is generally low. A substantial part of leaf litter entering running waters may be buried in the streambed because of flooding and sediment movement. Although the general significance of the hyporheic zone for stream metabolism has been reported early, organic matter storage within the sediment of streams has received less attention, with most studies only quantifying accumulations at the streambed surface and ignoring other stream compartments. In the present study, the amounts of three fractions of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM; > 16, 4-16 and 1-4 mm) were determined in late autumn and early spring in the interstitial and benthic zones of three headwater streams of the Montagne Noire (South-Western France) differing in their substratum grain size. Our findings demonstrated that the total CPOM content in the interstitial zone can be much (up to one order of magnitude) higher than at the sediment surface. The sandy bottomed stream exhibited a higher amount of CPOM (whatever the size fraction) than the two other streams, suggesting that the sediment particle size may be a major determinant of CPOM storage. Given the large amount of organic matter stored in the interstitial zone, this compartment may play an important role for the carbon turnover and associated trophic dynamics in the stream ecosystem.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000310754500006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoarse%2Bparticulate%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bin%2Bthe%2Binterstitial%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bthree%2BFrench%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJulien%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DCornut%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Flimn%252F2012019%26rft.epage%3D313%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-4088%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DANNALES%2BDE%2BLIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D303-313%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D303%26rft.stitle%3DANN%2BLIMNOL-INT%2BJ%2BLIM%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DCornut%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DElger%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DChauvet%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=ANNALES+DE+LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
31,"Runkel, RL",Jun 1998 ,Analysis of transient storage subject to unsteady flow: diel flow variation in an Antarctic stream,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Transport of dissolved material in streams and small rivers may be characterized using tracer-dilution methods and solute transport models. Recent studies have quantified stream/substream interactions using models of transient storage. These studies are based on tracer-dilution data obtained during periods of steady flow. We present a modeling framework for the analysis of transient storage in stream systems with unsteady flows. The framework couples a kinematic wave routing model with a solute transport model that includes transient storage. The routing model provides time-varying flows and cross-sectional areas that are used as input to the solute transport model.The modeling framework was used to quantify stream/substream interaction in Huey Creek, an Antarctic stream fed exclusively by glacial meltwater. Analysis of tracer-dilution data indicates that there was substantial interaction between the flowing surface water and the hyporheic (substream) zone. The ratio of storage zone area to stream cross-sectional area (A(S)/A) was >1 in all stream reaches, indicating that the substream area contributing to hyporheic exchange was large relative to stream cross-sectional area. The rate of exchange, as governed by the transient storage exchange coefficient (alpha), was rapid because of a high stream gradient and porous alluvial materials. Estimates of alpha generally exceed those determined for other small streams. The high degree of hyporheic exchange supports the hypothesis that weathering reactions within the hyporheos account for observed increases in solute concentration with stream length as noted in other studies of Antarctic streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000075262700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAnalysis%2Bof%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bsubject%2Bto%2Bunsteady%2Bflow%253A%2Bdiel%2Bflow%2Bvariation%2Bin%2Ban%2BAntarctic%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DRL%26rft.auinit%3DRL%26rft.aulast%3DRunkel%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1467958%26rft.epage%3D154%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D143-154%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D143%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DRunkel%252C%2BRL%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DAndrews%252C%2BED&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
32,"BOULTON, AJ",Jul 1995 ,HYPORHEIC PROCESSES DURING FLOODING AND DRYING IN A SONORAN DESERT STREAM .2. FAUNAL DYNAMICS,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Spatial and temporal changes in assemblage structure of the hyporheos of a Sonoran Desert stream were monitored after re-wetting occurred in winter at three sites with different flow regimens. Diverse assemblages of hyporheic invertebrates were found at all sites within two days of re-wetting. At two sites, drying represented a gradual press disturbance to the hyporheos, altering the assemblage composition from a predominance of cyclopoid copepods and chironomids to one dominated by microturbellarians, ceratopogonid larvae, ostracods, nematodes, and, just before the hyporheic zone dried, several species of water mites. There were fewest hyporheic taxa at the most intermittent site where cyclopoid copepods were most numerous. The site that remained inundated during the entire study harbored a speciose hyporheos whose composition varied vertically and laterally. Amphipods, isopods, and bathynellaceans were found in the ''phreatic'' (deeper than 50 cm) zone whereas cyclopoids, cladocerans, chironomids, and water mites were common in the ''shallow'' (< 50 cm) hyporheic habitat. In wells sunk in the stream bank, nematodes, ostracods, and bathynellaceans characterized the ''parafluvial'' zone. Spates temporarily altered the assemblage composition of the parafluvial and shallow hyporheic habitats but recovery was rapid, implying a resilient fauna. Phreatic assemblages were not immediately influenced by spates. At the scale of an individual reach (122 m), a distinct longitudinal pattern in assemblage composition was correlated with trends in water chemistry and the gradual transition from zones of hyporheic upwelling (discharge) to downwelling (recharge). Upwelling areas were nitrate-rich, hypoxic, and harbored a typically ''phreatic'' fauna whereas downwelling zones were well-oxygenated, low in nitrate, and were characterized by taxa found in the shallow hyporheos. This longitudinal pattern was consistent over time but became truncated as surface water receded upstream, altering the exchange of surface and subsurface water. Recognition of temporal changes in the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal variation in subsurface biota and how they respond to surficial hydrologic extremes is essential to understanding the way these subsystems interact with the surface stream ecosystem; the next goal is to determine the causes of these patterns.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1995RJ33500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHYPORHEIC%2BPROCESSES%2BDURING%2BFLOODING%2BAND%2BDRYING%2BIN%2BA%2BSONORAN%2BDESERT%2BSTREAM%2B.2.%2BFAUNAL%2BDYNAMICS%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBOULTON%26rft.date%3D1995%26rft.epage%3D52%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D27-52%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D27%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D134%26rft.au%3DBOULTON%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DSTANLEY%252C%2BEH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
33,"Triska, FJ",Feb 2007 ,DIN retention-transport through four hydrologically connected zones in a headwater catchment of the Upper Mississippi River,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) retention-transport through a headwater catchment was synthesized from studies encompassing four distinct hydrologic zones of the Shingobee River Headwaters near the origin of the Mississippi River. The hydrologic zones included: (1) hillslope ground water (ridge to bankside riparian); (2) alluvial riparian ground water; (3) ground water discharged through subchannel sediments (hyporheic zone); and (4) channel surface water. During subsurface hillslope transport through Zone 1, DIN, primarily nitrate, decreased from similar to 3 mg-N/l to < 0.1 mg-N/l. Ambient seasonal nitrate:chloride ratios in hillslope flow paths indicated both dilution and biotic processing caused nitrate loss. Biologically available organic carbon controlled biotic nitrate retention during hillslope transport. In the alluvial riparian zone (Zone 2) biologically available organic carbon controlled nitrate depletion although processing of both ambient and amended nitrate was faster during the summer than winter. In the hyporheic zone (Zone 3) and stream surface water (Zone 4) DIN retention was primarily controlled by temperature. Perfusion core studies using hyporheic sediment indicated sufficient organic carbon in bed sediments to retain ground water DIN via coupled nitrification-denitrification. Numerical simulations of seasonal hyporheic sediment nitrification-denitrification rates from perfusion cores adequately predicted surface water ammonium but not nitrate when compared to 5 years of monthly field data (1989-93). Mass balance studies in stream surface water indicated proportionally higher summer than winter N retention. Watershed DIN retention was effective during summer under the current land use of intermittently grazed pasture. However, more intensive land use such as row crop agriculture would decrease nitrate retention efficiency and increase loads to surface water. Understanding DIN retention capacity throughout the system, including special channel features such as sloughs, wetlands and floodplains that provide surface water-ground water connectivity, will be required to develop effective nitrate management strategies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000244429900006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDIN%2Bretention-transport%2Bthrough%2Bfour%2Bhydrologically%2Bconnected%2Bzones%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bcatchment%2Bof%2Bthe%2BUpper%2BMississippi%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DFrank%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DFJ%26rft.aulast%3DTriska%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1752-1688.2007.00006.x%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D71%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D60-71%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D60%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DTriska%252C%2BFJ%26rft.au%3DDuff%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DAvanzino%252C%2BRJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
34,"Hall, RO",Jan 2016 ,"Metabolism, Gas Exchange, and Carbon Spiraling in Rivers",ECOSYSTEMS,"Ecosystem metabolism, that is, gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), controls organic carbon (OC) cycling in stream and river networks and is expected to vary predictably with network position. However, estimates of metabolism in small streams outnumber those from rivers such that there are limited empirical data comparing metabolism across a range of stream and river sizes. We measured metabolism in 14 rivers (discharge range 14-84 m(3) s(-1)) in the Western and Midwestern United States (US). We estimated GPP, ER, and gas exchange rates using a Lagrangian, 2-station oxygen model solved in a Bayesian framework. GPP ranged from 0.6-22 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and ER tracked GPP, suggesting that autotrophic production supports much of riverine ER in summer. Net ecosystem production, the balance between GPP and ER was 0 or greater in 4 rivers showing autotrophy on that day. River velocity and slope predicted gas exchange estimates from these 14 rivers in agreement with empirical models. Carbon turnover lengths (that is, the distance traveled before OC is mineralized to CO2) ranged from 38 to 1190 km, with the longest turnover lengths in high-sediment, arid-land rivers. We also compared estimated turnover lengths with the relative length of the river segment between major tributaries or lakes; the mean ratio of carbon turnover length to river length was 1.6, demonstrating that rivers can mineralize much of the OC load along their length at baseflow. Carbon mineralization velocities ranged from 0.05 to 0.81 m d(-1), and were not different than measurements from small streams. Given high GPP relative to ER, combined with generally short OC spiraling lengths, rivers can be highly reactive with regard to OC cycling.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000373017800006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMetabolism%252C%2BGas%2BExchange%252C%2Band%2BCarbon%2BSpiraling%2Bin%2BRivers%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BO.%26rft.auinit%3DRO%26rft.aulast%3DHall%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10021-015-9918-1%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0629%26rft.epage%3D86%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1432-9840%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D73-86%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D73%26rft.stitle%3DECOSYSTEMS%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO%26rft.au%3DTank%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DHotchkiss%252C%2BER&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=ECOSYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
35,"McCallum, JL",Mar 2016 ,Residence times of stream-groundwater exchanges due to transient stream stage fluctuations,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The biogeochemical functioning of stream ecosystems is heavily dependent on water and water-borne nutrient fluxes between the stream itself and the streambed and banks (i.e., the hyporheic zone). The travel time of water exchanges through the hyporheic zone has been investigated previously; however, these studies have primarily modeled exchanges under steady state conditions assuming spatial pressure variations. This assumes that the hydraulic gradients that drive the exchanges are maintained the whole time the stream water remains in the bed or banks, which is unrealistic. Therefore, in this study we use a transient approach to investigate residence time distributions (RTDs) of bank inflow and bank outflow during both regular, diurnal stream stage variations and storm flow events. We demonstrate that RTDs reflect the timing and magnitude bank inflows, rather than smooth RTDs. We also show that small percentages of water from a given bank inflow event may be present in bank outflows for long periods of time, due to dispersion and diffusion within the bank, and lower rates of bank outflow, relative to bank inflow. This is apparent in the synthetic model of a single storm flow event, where 10% remained in the bank after 50 days. Additionally, residence times for a given bank inflow event are longer when repeated events occur, because the bank outflows from one event are interrupted by an increase in stream stage during a successive event. For example, field data capturing events of variable timing and magnitude showed that 70 days after each of three storm flow events occurred, 40, 12 and 30% of the bank inflow event remained in the banks. These cases indicate that bank exchanges are temporally dynamic and the RTDs of return flows can have significant tailing, which will dictate rates of nutrient exchange within the near-stream environment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000374706300028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DResidence%2Btimes%2Bof%2Bstream-groundwater%2Bexchanges%2Bdue%2Bto%2Btransient%2Bstream%2Bstage%2Bfluctuations%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DMcCallum%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017441%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2073%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2059-2073%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2059%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DMcCallum%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DShanafield%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
36,"Mermillod-Blondin, F",Jun 2015 ,Links between sediment structures and ecological processes in the hyporheic zone: ground-penetrating radar as a non-invasive tool to detect subsurface biologically active zones,ECOHYDROLOGY,"At the scale of geomorphological units (riffles, pools, and gravel bars), the contribution of the hyporheic zone to the functioning of streams and rivers depends on the hydrological exchanges between surface water and groundwater. These exchanges are largely controlled by sediment structure and texture, which are difficult to assess with classical methods (shovelling and freeze coring). We aimed to evaluate the ability of a non-destructive method, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), to detect sediment structures associated with subsurface biologically active zones in a gravel-bed river. After GPR data acquisition and processing, a three-dimensional reconstruction of a gravel bar permitted the identification of two sediment facies: a cobble/gravel lithofacies denoted as coarse' and a sand/gravel lithofacies denoted as fine'. We installed piezometers along two longitudinal profiles (each corresponding to a lithofacies identified by GPR) and monitored hydraulic head and temperature for 20days. Water and sediments were sampled along the two profiles to measure water physicochemistry, sediment characteristics, bacterial abundance and activity, and interstitial invertebrate assemblages. These measurements confirmed that the two profiles were characterized by distinct hydrological flow rates and associated biological activities. Rapid water transport in the coarse profile fuelled the hyporheic zone with organic matter, whereas water and organic matter supplies were lower in the fine profile. Consequently, the higher supply of organic matter in the coarse profile was associated with higher microbial activities and invertebrate density and diversity. Therefore, GPR could be an efficient tool to detect the sediment features playing a key role in hyporheic zone functioning.

We characterised the invertebrate community at two depths (20 and 35 cm), in the heads and tails of riffles at low and high groundwater levels. Taxon density declined significantly with increasing depth. The abundance of invertebrates did not differ significantly between the heads and tails of riffles and also did not respond to changes in groundwater level. The results suggest that the chalk hyporheic zone is a shallow habitat that is relatively homogenous at the riffle scale with respect to the distribution of fauna and potentially resilient to seasonal groundwater level fluctuations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000399051100010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B10%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Binvertebrate%2Bcommunity%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bchalk%2Bstream%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2Bspatio-temporal%2Bdistribution%2Bpatterns%26rft.aufirst%3DOctavian%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DPacioglu%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Fkmae%252F2017001%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1961-9502%26rft.issue%3D418%26rft.jtitle%3DKNOWLEDGE%2BAND%2BMANAGEMENT%2BOF%2BAQUATIC%2BECOSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DKNOWL%2BMANAG%2BAQUAT%2BEC%26rft.au%3DPacioglu%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DRobertson%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=KNOWLEDGE+AND+MANAGEMENT+OF+AQUATIC+ECOSYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
38,"Stubbington, R",Dec 2019 ,Alpha and beta diversity of connected benthic-subsurface invertebrate communities respond to drying in dynamic river ecosystems,ECOGRAPHY,"Drying disturbances are the primary determinant of aquatic community biodiversity in dynamic river ecosystems. Research exploring how communities respond to disturbance has focused on benthic invertebrates in surface sediments, inadequately representing a connected community that extends into the subsurface. We compared subsurface and benthic invertebrate responses to drying, to identify common and context-dependent spatial patterns. We characterized community composition, alpha diversity and beta diversity across a gradient of drying duration. Subsurface communities responded to drying, but these responses were typically less pronounced than those of benthic communities. Despite compositional changes and in contrast to reductions in benthic alpha diversity, the alpha diversity of subsurface communities remained stable except at long drying durations. Some primarily benthic taxa were among those whose subsurface frequency and abundance responded positively to drying. Collectively, changing composition, stable richness and taxon-specific increases in occurrence provide evidence that subsurface sediments can support persistence of invertebrate communities during drying disturbances. Beta-diversity patterns varied and no consistent patterns distinguished the total diversity, turnover or nestedness of subsurface compared to benthic communities. In response to increasing drying duration, beta diversity increased or remained stable for benthic communities, but remained stable or decreased for subsurface communities, likely reflecting contrasts in the influence of mass effects, priority effects and environmental filtering. Dissimilarity between subsurface and benthic communities remained stable or increased with drying duration, suggesting that subsurface communities maintain distinct biodiversity value while also supporting temporary influxes of benthic taxa during drying events. As temporary rivers increase in extent due to global change, we highlight that recognizing the connected communities that extend into the subsurface sediments can enable holistic understanding of ecological responses to drying, the key determinant of biodiversity in these dynamic ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000486948300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAlpha%2Band%2Bbeta%2Bdiversity%2Bof%2Bconnected%2Bbenthic-subsurface%2Binvertebrate%2Bcommunities%2Brespond%2Bto%2Bdrying%2Bin%2Bdynamic%2Briver%2Becosystems%26rft.aufirst%3DRachel%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DStubbington%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fecog.04592%26rft.eissn%3D1600-0587%26rft.epage%3D2073%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0906-7590%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DECOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2060-2073%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2060%26rft.stitle%3DECOGRAPHY%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DStubbington%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DSarremejane%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=ECOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

GPR data interpretations from the alluvial-lined stream site illustrate greater thaw depths beneath riffle and gravel bar features relative to neighboring pool features. The peat-lined stream sites indicate the opposite; greater thaw depths beneath pools and shallower thaw beneath the connecting runs.

40,"Ryan, RJ",May 30 2006 ,"Changes in streambed sediment characteristics and solute transport in the headwaters of Valley Creek, an urbanizing watershed",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Changes in streambed sediments were monitored in conjunction with Q series of conservative solute tracer injections over a 2-year period to assess the effects of urbanization on two streams in the Valley Creek watershed, located in Chester County, Pennsylvania approximately 30 km west of Philadelphia. The modeling package OTIS was used to analyze the solute transport behavior. Comparison of the results from the two streams demonstrates that the fine sediment fraction of the streambed controls hydraulic conductivity and transient storage exchange in this gravel- and cobble-bed Piedmont system. One site had a narrow (10-40 m) riparian corridor of mowed lawn and woody brush. At this site, the silt-clay fraction (d < 50 mu m) of the fine sediment (d < 2 mm) increased from 6 to 25% during the course of the study. The relationship between sediment characteristics and transient storage exchange was evaluated using the method of Worman et al. [Worman, A., Packman, A.I., Johansson, H., Jonsson, K., 2002a. Effect of flow-induced exchange in hyporheic zones on longitudinal transport of solutes in streams and rivers. Water Resources Research 38. doi: 10.1029/2001WR000769], who showed that the hyporheic residence time, scaled by the hydraulic conductivity and stream depth, is a function of stream velocity and physical channel characteristics. This analysis indicated that the observed change in fine sediment composition caused a two-fold reduction in the hydraulic conductivity, a four-fold reduction in the transient storage area, and an order of magnitude reduction in the exchange coefficient. The second study site had a wide (100-300 m) riparian corridor of deciduous forest. During the study period, a parcel of woodland encompassing 11% of the drainage area was cleared and nine homes were constructed on the site. Despite this prominent development of the watershed, there was no significant change in sediment characteristics or solute transport during the study period. The model-derived transient storage exchange parameters in our urbanizing study sites were found to be statistically similar to the values for forested mountain streams given in the literature. Thus, the relationship between urbanization and transient storage should be determined by examining the temporal change in the characteristics of individual stream reaches rather than by comparing the solute transport parameters obtained in different types of streams.

41,"Pittroff, M",Jan 2017 ,Quantifying nitrate and oxygen reduction rates in the hyporheic zone using Rn-222 to upscale biogeochemical turnover in rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Quantifying and upscaling chemical turnover in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is difficult due to limited reaction rate data, unknown carbon quality, and few methods for upscaling local measurements to river networks. Here we develop a method for quantifying reaction kinetics in situ in the HZ and upscaling biogeochemical turnover to catchment scales. Radon-222 was used to quantify water residence times in the HZ of the Roter Main River (RM), Germany. Residence times were then combined with O-2, NO3-, CO2, DOC, and carbon quality (EEMs, SUVA) data to estimate Monod and first-order reaction rates. Monod parameters mu(max) and k(sat) for NO3- reduction were 11 mu mol l(-1) h(-1) and 52 mmol l(-1), respectively, while the first-order rate was 0.04 h(-1). Carbon quality was highly bioavailable in the HZ and is unlikely to be limiting. Reaction kinetics was incorporated into the FINIFLUX model to upscale NO3- mass loss over a 32 km reach of the RM. The aims were to (1) to estimate hyporheic efficiency using Damkohler numbers (Da), and (2) calculate NO3- mass loss in the HZ over the reach. The Da analysis suggests that the hyporheic zone is inefficient for NO3- processing, however, this is somewhat misleading as the largest NO3- mass loss occurs at the shortest residence times where Da << 1. This is due to the largest water flux occurring in the uppermost part of the sediment profile. Nitrate processing in the HZ accounted for 24 kg NO3- h(-1) over the reach, which was 20% of the NO3- flux from the catchment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394911200034,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bnitrate%2Band%2Boxygen%2Breduction%2Brates%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Busing%2BRn-222%2Bto%2Bupscale%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bturnover%2Bin%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DPittroff%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR018917%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D579%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D563-579%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D563%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DPittroff%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DFrei%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DGilfedder%252C%2BBS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Angermann, L",Oct 11 2012 ,Application of heat pulse injections for investigating shallow hyporheic flow in a lowland river,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic zone processes can have significant impact on groundwater and surface water resources. Detailed knowledge of exchange flow patterns is crucial for understanding the ecohydrological and biogeochemical functioning of river corridors. In particular, small-scale hyporheic exchange flow is still poorly understood, partially because of the lack of adequate in situ monitoring technology. This paper investigates the spatial heterogeneity of hyporheic exchange flow in a lowland river at multiple scales. It demonstrates the conjunctive use of active heat pulse tracing at shallow depths (15 cm) and vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) at 120-150 cm streambed depth for improving the understanding of hyporheic exchange flow processes. Generally positive VHG indicated a regional dominance of groundwater up-welling. High and temporally variable VHG were used to identify confined conditions caused by low conductivity layers in the subsurface (low connectivity), while locations with lower and temporally less variable VHG indicated free groundwater up-welling (high connectivity) in highly conductive sediments. A heat pulse sensor (HPS) was applied for identifying shallow hyporheic flow at three locations representative for high versus low streambed connectivity. Shallow hyporheic flow patterns were found to be spatially heterogeneous. Subsurface flow could only partially be explained by streambed topography. Surface water infiltration and horizontal flow coincided with inhibited groundwater upwelling, whereas locations with high streambed connectivity were characterized by increased up-welling. The combined information of spatiotemporal VHG variability and flow vector frequency distribution by HPS has the potential to improve the understanding of impacts of streambed topography and subsurface stratification on hyporheic flow patterns.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309835500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW00P02%26rft.atitle%3DApplication%2Bof%2Bheat%2Bpulse%2Binjections%2Bfor%2Binvestigating%2Bshallow%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bin%2Ba%2Blowland%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DLisa%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DAngermann%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2012WR012564%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DAngermann%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Duke, JR",Jan 15 2007 ,Riparian influence on hyporheic-zone formation downstream of a small dam in the Blackland Prairie region of Texas,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Small-order streams have highly variable flows that can result in large temporal and spatial variation of the hyporheic zone. Darn construction along these intermittent headwater streams alters downstream flow and influences the hydrologic balance between stream water and the adjacent riparian zone. A 3-year site study was conducted along an impounded second-order stream to determine the water balance between stream, unsaturated zone, groundwater and riparian vegetation. The presence of the upstream impoundment provided near-perennial water flow in the stream channel. The observed woody plant transpiration accounted for 71% of average annual water loss in the site. The overall contribution of stream water via the hyporheic zone to site water balance was 73 cut, or 44% of total inputs. This exceeded both rainfall and upland subsurface contribution to the site. A highly dynamic hyporheic zone was indicated by high water use from woody plants that fluctuated seasonally with stream water levels. We found leaf area development in the canopy layer to be closely coupled with stream and groundwater fluctuations, indicating its usefulness as a potential indicator of site water balance for small dam systems. The net result of upstream impoundment increased riparian vegetation productivity by influencing movement of stream water to storage in the groundwater system.

44,"Heathwaite, AL",Apr 2021 ,Spatial and temporal dynamics of nitrogen exchange in an upwelling reach of a groundwater-fed river and potential response to perturbations changing rainfall patterns under UK climate change scenarios,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"We report the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange flows (HEFs) and nitrogen exchange in an upwelling reach of a 200 m groundwater-fed river. We show how research combining hydrological measurement, geophysics and isotopes, together with nutrient speciation techniques provides insight on nitrogen pathways and transformations that could not have been captured otherwise, including a zone of vertical preferential discharge of nitrate from deeper groundwater, and a zone of rapid denitrification linking the floodplain with the riverbed. Nitrate attenuation in the reach is dominated by denitrification but is spatially highly variable. This variability is driven by groundwater flow pathways and landscape setting, which influences hyporheic flow, residence time and nitrate removal. We observed the spatial connectivity of the river to the riparian zone is important because zones of horizontal preferential discharge supply organic matter from the floodplain and create anoxic riverbed conditions with overlapping zones of nitrification potential and denitrification activity that peaked 10-20 cm below the riverbed. Our data also show that temporal variability in water pathways in the reach is driven by changes in stage of the order of tens of centimetres and by strength of water flux, which may influence the depth of delivery of dissolved organic carbon. The temporal variability is sensitive to changes to river flows under UK climate projections that anticipate a 14%-15% increase in regional median winter rainfall and a 14%-19% reduction in summer rainfall. Superimposed on seasonal projections is more intensive storm activity that will likely lead to a more dynamic and inherently complex (hydrologically and biogeochemically) hyporheic zone. We recorded direct evidence of suppression of upwelling groundwater (flow reversal) during rainfall events.

Despite the importance of hyporheic exchange on riverine ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles, research is limited on the effects of hyporheic fluxes on the fate of reactive solutes within the hyporheic zone. Consequently, we investigate the controls of hyporheic flowpaths, which we link to stream morphology and streamflow, on prevailing hyporheic redox conditions and on biogeochemical transformations occurring within streambeds. We focus on the dissolved inorganic reactive forms of nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate, because nitrogen is one of the most common reactive solutes and an essential nutrient found in stream waters. Our objectives are to explore the influence of stream morphology, hyporheic water temperature and relative abundance of ammonium and nitrate, on transformation of ammonium, removal of nitrates and production of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. We address our objectives with analytical solutions of the Multispecies Reactive Advection-Dispersion Equation coupled with linearized Monod's kinetics and analytical solutions of the hyporheic flow for alternate-bar morphology. We introduce a new Damkohler number, Da, defined as the ratio between the median hyporheic residence time and the time scale of oxygen consumption, which we prove to be a good indicator of where aerobic or anaerobic conditions prevail. In addition, Da is a key index to quantify hyporheic nitrification and denitrification efficiencies and defines a new theoretical framework for scaling results at both the morphological-unit and stream-reach scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309137300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG00N10%26rft.atitle%3DMorphodynamic%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bredox%2Bconditions%2Band%2Bon%2Bnitrogen%2Bdynamics%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2BApplication%2Bto%2Bgravel%2Bbed%2Brivers%2Bwith%2Balternate-bar%2Bmorphology%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarzadri%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2012JG001966%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D117%26rft.au%3DMarzadri%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DBellin%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
46,"Hannah, DM",Nov 2004 ,"Heat exchanges and temperatures within a salmon spawning stream in the cairngorms, Scotland: Seasonal and sub-seasonal dynamics",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Stream temperatures are often used to predict salmonid embryo development; but there are very few medium-term studies of the heat exchanges determining water column and bed temperatures. Furthermore, no research exists on the energy balance for sub-arctic Scottish rivers. This paper reports results of a hydrometeorological study of a Cairngorm stream (Girnock burn, northeast Scotland) over the salmon spawning-hatch season (late October 2001 to mid-April 2002) that aims: (1) to characterize seasonal and sub-seasonal stream energy budget and thermal dynamics; and (2) to explain these variations with respect to meteorological and hydrological factors. In terms of average energy flux contributions, sensible heat (38.7%), the bed heat flux (37.0%) and friction at the stream bed and banks (24.3%) are heat sources, while latent heat (73.1 %) and net radiation (26.9%) are heat sinks. All energy losses and 38.7% of heat gains occur at the air-water interface; and 61.3% of energy gains (including friction) take place at the water-channel bed interface. Typically, temperatures increase (+ 1.97degreesC) and show dampening of thermal response from the water column to depth in the stream bed. The most salient findings include: (1) the stream bed (atmosphere) is the dominant energy source (sink) for heating (cooling) channel water, which may be attributed to inferred heat advection by groundwater up-welling into the bed of this upland stream; (2) sensible heat is the primary atmospheric energy source due to limited net radiation; (3) friction at the stream bed and banks is an important heat source. Energy budget terms and temperatures exhibit (sub-)seasonal changes in response to meteorological and hydrological conditions; a schematic diagram is presented to summarize these results. This paper clearly illustrates the need for further medium- to long-term empirical stream energy balance research to characterize heat flux dynamics and, thus, understand and predict water temperature variations over time-scales of relevance to biological studies.

Surface water concentrations of chloride, dissolved organic carbon (DOG), and chlorophyll-a exceeded those of groundwater during most sampling periods. Groundwater and hyporheic concentrations of silica (SiO2), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate+nitrite (NO3-N), and ammonium (NH4-N) were generally higher than in surface water, particularly during summer. Hyporheic temperatures exhibited sharpest gradients with depth and distance downstream beneath a study riffle during summer and winter. Biologically reactive solutes (SRP, NO3-N, NH4-N, and DOC) generally decreased with depth and increased with distance beneath the riffle during summer and winter as well. Hyporheic patterns were indistinct or more variable during spring and fall and were attributed, in part, to the breakdown of thermal gradients within the bed, similar to seasonal lake turnover (mixis). Similarities between longitudinal/depth gradients in hyporheic patterns and longitudinal stream channel patterns for SiO2 and Cl (the more conservative solutes) indicated potential cumulative groundwater discharge effects through successive hyporheic zones over stream distance. Relationships between hyporheic patterns, stream channel patterns, and the biologically reactive solutes (SRP, NO3-N, NH4-N, DOC) were less clear because of potential biotic or abiotic uptake at the sediment-water interface. Groundwater-surface water interaction within a hyporheic zone forms a complex system structured not only by hydrologic forces but also by seasonal changes in temperature and discharge.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1995TE86900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSEASONAL%2BBIOGEOCHEMICAL%2BPATTERNS%2BIN%2BSURFACE-WATER%252C%2BSUBSURFACE%2BHYPORHEIC%252C%2BAND%2BRIPARIAN%2BGROUND-WATER%2BIN%2BA%2BTEMPERATE%2BSTREAM%2BECOSYSTEM%26rft.aufirst%3DSP%26rft.auinit%3DSP%26rft.aulast%3DHENDRICKS%26rft.date%3D1995%26rft.epage%3D490%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D459-490%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D459%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D134%26rft.au%3DHENDRICKS%252C%2BSP%26rft.au%3DWHITE%252C%2BDS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Brookfield, AE",Oct 1 2013 ,Implications of Hyporheic Flow on Temperature-Based Estimates of Groundwater/Surface Water Interactions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The hyporheic zone has received significant attention in recent years due to its role in regulating the physical, chemical, and biological processes that buffer fluvial systems at a variety of scales. The exchange of water through the hyporheic zone is also important for the regulation of stream and streambed temperatures. Recent research has utilized stream and streambed temperatures to quantify groundwater discharge to streams using a variety of methods, including one-dimensional analytical solutions for vertical flux across the streambed interface. The presence of lateral flows, including hyporheic flow, will cause uncertainty in these analytical solution results. In this study, HydroGeoSphere, a three-dimensional, fully integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic model, is used to simulate the manner in which streambed heterogeneity influences groundwater/surface water interactions along a stream section, and the uncertainty of groundwater/surface water flux estimates based upon streambed temperatures. Groundwater/surface water exchange fluxes from numerical experiments of an idealized linear reach with homogeneous and heterogeneous streambed materials are compared to the results of a one-dimensional analytical solution of groundwater discharge to a stream using the numerically simulated temperature results. Both low- and high-variance distributions of hydraulic conductivity (ln K variances of 0.85 and 17.0, respectively) along the streambed caused hyporheic flow, which caused significant discrepancies between the numerical and analytical groundwater/surface water flux results. A low variance in hydraulic conductivity did result in smaller discrepancies between the numerical and analytical solutions compared to the higher-variance simulations; however, the discrepancies between the low-K-variance simulations and the associated analytical solution interpretation still differed by up to an order in magnitude. The quantity of hyporheic flow increased with increased depth of heterogeneous streambed sediments, causing greater discrepancies between the analytical estimate and the numerical solution of groundwater/surface water exchange. In all simulations the analytical solution underestimated the exchange flux, and in the presence of hyporheic flow, the analytical solution was unable to capture the patterns of exchange flux at the streambed. The three-dimensional modeling approach produced an increase in the lateral flow components within the streambed compared to results inferred from one- and two-dimensional models employed in previous research. This three-dimensional approach enabled analysis of the spatial variability of error between the analytical and numerical results and determined that in environments with lateral flows, including hyporheic flow, the analytical solution is indicative of the patterns of the vertical component of fluid flow to the streambed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000324466700008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImplications%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2Bon%2BTemperature-Based%2BEstimates%2Bof%2BGroundwater%252FSurface%2BWater%2BInteractions%26rft.aufirst%3DAndrea%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DAE%26rft.aulast%3DBrookfield%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HE.1943-5584.0000726%26rft.eissn%3D1943-5584%26rft.epage%3D1261%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1084-0699%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1250-1261%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1250%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DBrookfield%252C%2BAE%26rft.au%3DSudicky%252C%2BEA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Zarnetske, JP",Mar 2015 ,Coupling multiscale observations to evaluate hyporheic nitrate removal at the reach scale,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Excess NO3- in streams is a growing and persistent problem for both inland and coastal ecosystems, and denitrification is the primary removal process for NO3-. Hyporheic zones can have high denitrification potentials, but their role in reach- and network-scale NO3- removal is unknown because it is difficult to estimate. We used independent and complementary multiscale measurements of denitrification and total NO3- uptake to quantify the role of hyporheic NO3- removal in a 303-m reach of a 3(rd)-order agricultural stream in western Oregon, USA. We characterized the reach-scale NO3- dynamics with steady-state N-15-NO3- tracer-addition experiments and solute-transport modeling, and measured the hyporheic conditions via in-situ biogeochemical and groundwater modeling. We also developed a method to link these independent multiscale measurements. Hyporheic NO3- removal (rate coefficient (HZ) = 0.007/h) accounted for 17% of the observed total reach NO3- uptake and 32% of the reach denitrification estimated from the N-15 experiments. The primary limitations on hyporheic denitrification at the reach scale were availability of labile dissolved organic C and the restricted size of the hyporheic zone caused by anthropogenic channelization (sediment thickness 1.5 m). Linking multiscale methods made estimates possible for hyporheic influence on stream NO3- dynamics. However, it also demonstrated that the traditional reach-scale tracer experimental designs and subsequent transport modeling cannot be used alone to directly investigate the role of the hyporheic zone on reach-scale water and solute dynamics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000349995000014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bmultiscale%2Bobservations%2Bto%2Bevaluate%2Bhyporheic%2Bnitrate%2Bremoval%2Bat%2Bthe%2Breach%2Bscale%26rft.aufirst%3DJay%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DZarnetske%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F680011%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D186%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D172-186%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D172%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DHaggerty%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39sMtAAwrQmqjxXhpPAZ9&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
