0,0,"Liu, YY",Feb 7 2017 ,Coupled Hydro-Biogeochemical Processes Controlling Cr Reductive Immobilization in Columbia River Hyporheic Zone,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"An experiment and modeling study was conducted to investigate coupled hydro-biogeochemical processes controlling reductive immobilization of groundwater Cr in the hyporheic zone (HZ) at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site, where dynamic surface water groundwater exchange occurs on a daily basis. Experiments were performed to calibrate kinetic models, and the calibrated models were incorporated into a multicomponent reactive transport model to simulate Cr redox transformation and immobilization under field hydrological conditions. The results revealed that the rates of Cr(VI) reduction, Cr(III) accumulation, and Cr(VI) release to the river are mostly affected by dynamic sediment redox conditions represented by Fe(II) reactivity, which is controlled by its cyclic interaction with O-2 carried by river water, microbial activities, and the supply and bioavailability of organic carbon (OC) that is present in the HZ and/or carried by transport. In addition, the HZ geophysical properties including hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the top alluvial layer have a significant influence on Cr reactive transport and immobilization by controlling residence times for reactions and the supply rates of O-2, Cr, and OC into the HZ. The results provide important insights into the dynamic redox environments in the HZ that can reductively immobilize contaminants.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000393738700058,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2BHydro-Biogeochemical%2BProcesses%2BControlling%2BCr%2BReductive%2BImmobilization%2Bin%2BColumbia%2BRiver%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DYuanyuan%26rft.auinit%3DYY%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.est.6b05099%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D1517%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1508-1517%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1508%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BYY%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BCX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/acs.est.6b05099,,"ORGANIC-CARBON,CHROMIUM(VI) REDUCTION,HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM,BACTERIAL REDUCTION,CHROMATE REDUCTION,TRANSIENT STORAGE,BATCH EXPERIMENTS,SURFACE-WATER,STREAM,GROUNDWATER",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99354 USA"
1,1,"Cheng, FY",Jun 2021 ,"Nevertheless, They Persisted: Can Hyporheic Zones Increase the Persistence of Estrogens in Streams?",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The presence of estrogens has been linked to adverse ecological effects in surface waters downstream of agricultural and domestic wastewater sources. While laboratory studies suggest that these estrogens should not persist because of fast degradation rates, elevated concentrations in surface waters impacted by agricultural activities are commonly observed. Using a combination of measured data and a stream-hyporheic zone (HZ) model applied to a 100 km reach in a tile-drained catchment, we show that the HZ can increase the persistence of estrogens. Field data reveal high concentrations of sorbed estrogens in sediments and elevated in-stream concentrations during low-flow summer months, suggesting that the HZ acts as a source of estrogens when transport into the streams is minimal. Model results provide further insight into the underlying mechanisms that enable sustained estrogen concentrations in streams, with the HZ acting as a source of dissolved estrogens for 95% of the year. We show that stream water interactions with the HZ may lead to overall suppression of degradation processes and an increase in the persistence of estrogens. Results suggest that when the model considered exchange in the HZ, approximately 28%-49% of estrogen mass remained in the stream ecosystem, while all estrogen mass was degraded in a 100-km reach in the model without the HZ. The remaining mass increased with increasing estrogen sorption coefficient, and this would potentially increase the lag time for lowering estrogen concentrations in surface water bodies even when inputs have ceased. Our findings highlight the importance of including HZ dynamics in estrogen transport models.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000667245100014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028518%26rft.atitle%3DNevertheless%252C%2BThey%2BPersisted%253A%2BCan%2BHyporheic%2BZones%2BIncrease%2Bthe%2BPersistence%2Bof%2BEstrogens%2Bin%2BStreams%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DFrederick%2BY.%26rft.auinit%3DFY%26rft.aulast%3DCheng%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028518%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BFY%26rft.au%3DPreisendanz%252C%2BHE%26rft.au%3DBasu%252C%2BNB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR028518,"agricultural legacies,contaminant fate,emerging contaminants,estrogen,hyporheic zone","ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS,NATURAL ESTROGENS,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,FATHEAD MINNOWS,MODEL STRUCTURE,ORGANIC-CARBON,UNITED-STATES,17-BETA-ESTRADIOL,WATER,RIVER",,"Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada"
2,2,"Mojarrad, BB",Feb 2019 ,Fragmentation of the Hyporheic Zone Due to Regional Groundwater Circulation,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"By use of numerical modeling and field observations, this work quantified the effects of catchment-scale upwelling groundwater on the hyporheic (below stream) fluxes over a wide range of spatial scales. A groundwater flow model was developed that specifically accounted for the hydrostatic and dynamic head fluctuations induced by the streambed topography. Although the magnitudes and relative importance of these streambed-induced fluxes were found to be highly sensitive to site-specific hydromorphological properties, we showed that streambed topographic structures exert a predominant control on the magnitude of hyporheic exchange fluxes in a Swedish boreal catchment. The magnitude of the exchange intensity evaluated at the streambed interface was found to be dominated by the streambed-induced hydraulic head across stream order. However, the catchment-scale groundwater flow field substantially affected the distribution of groundwater discharge points and thus decreased the fragmentation of the hyporheic zone, specifically by shifting the cumulative density function toward larger areas of coherent upwelling at the streambed interface. This work highlights the spectrum of spatial scales affecting the surface water-groundwater exchange patterns and resolves the roles of key mechanisms in controlling the fragmentation of the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000461858900020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFragmentation%2Bof%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BDue%2Bto%2BRegional%2BGroundwater%2BCirculation%26rft.aufirst%3DB.%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DBB%26rft.aulast%3DMojarrad%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR024609%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1262%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1242-1262%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1242%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DMojarrad%252C%2BBB%26rft.au%3DRiml%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DLaudon%252C%2BH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR024609,"GW-SW interaction,hyporheic zone,multiscale modeling,fragmentation of upwelling zones","SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,BED FORMS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,EXCHANGE PROCESSES,STREAM,DISCHARGE,RIVER,TRANSPORT,AQUIFER,FLOW",,"KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Stockholm, Sweden"
3,3,"Briggs, MA",Jun 2013 ,"Relating hyporheic fluxes, residence times, and redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes upstream of beaver dams",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Small dams enhance the development of patchy microenvironments along stream corridors by trapping sediment and creating complex streambed morphologies. This patchiness drives intricate hyporheic flux patterns that govern the exchange of O-2 and redox-sensitive solutes between the water column and the stream bed. We used multiple tracer techniques, naturally occurring and injected, to evaluate hyporheic flow dynamics and associated biogeochemical cycling and microbial reactivity around 2 beaver dams in Wyoming (USA). High-resolution fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing was used to collect temperature data over 9 vertical streambed profiles and to generate comprehensive vertical flux maps using 1-dimensional (1-D) heat-transport modeling. Coincident with these locations, vertical profiles of hyporheic water were collected every week and analyzed for dissolved O2, pH, dissolved organic C, and several conservative and redox-sensitive solutes. In addition, hyporheic and net stream aerobic microbial reactivity were analyzed with a constant-rate injection of the biologically sensitive resazurin (Raz) smart tracer. The combined results revealed a heterogeneous system with rates of downwelling hyporheic flow organized by morphologic unit and tightly coupled to the redox conditions of the subsurface. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the variability of all redox-sensitive species, and results indicated that hyporheic water varied from oxic-stream-like to anoxic-reduced in direct response to the hydrodynamic conditions and associated residence times. The anaerobic transition threshold predicted by the mean O-2 Damko ""hler number seemed to overestimate the actual transition as indicated by multiple secondary electron acceptors, illustrating the gradient nature of anaerobic transition. Temporal flux variability in low-flux morphologies generated a much greater range in hyporheic redox conditions compared to high-flux zones, and chemical responses to changing flux rates were consistent with those predicted from the empirical relationship between redox condition and residence time. The Raz tracer revealed that hyporheic flow paths have strong net aerobic respiration, particularly at higher residence time, but this reactive exchange did not affect the net stream signal at the reach scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000318774500021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRelating%2Bhyporheic%2Bfluxes%252C%2Bresidence%2Btimes%252C%2Band%2Bredox-sensitive%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bprocesses%2Bupstream%2Bof%2Bbeaver%2Bdams%26rft.aufirst%3DMartin%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DBriggs%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F12-110.1%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D641%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D622-641%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D622%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DBriggs%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DLautz%252C%2BLK%26rft.au%3DGonzalez-Pinzon%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1899/12-110.1,"hyporheic,biogeochemistry,residence time,redox,beaver dam,nitrate,hotspot,resazurin,smart tracer.","ELECTRON-ACCEPTING PROCESSES,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,HYDROLOGICAL EXCHANGE,WATER FLUX,STREAM,HEAT,ZONE,AQUIFER,TRACER,FLOW",,"US Geol Survey, Off Groundwater, Branch Geophys, Unit 5015, 11 Sherman Pl, Storrs, CT 06269 USA"
4,4,"Trauth, N",Jan 2017 ,Single discharge events increase reactive efficiency of the hyporheic zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In this study, we investigate the impact of single stream discharge events on water exchange, solute transport, and reactions in the hyporheic zone below a natural in-stream gravel bar. We set up a reactive transport groundwater model with streamflow scenarios that vary by event duration and peak discharge. A steady ambient groundwater flow field is assumed that results in losing, neutral, or gaining stream conditions depending on the stream stage. Across the streambed dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, and nitrate are transported into the subsurface. Additional nitrate is received from upwelling groundwater. Aerobic respiration and denitrification are simulated for scenarios with different stream solute concentrations. Results show that hyporheic exchange flux, solute transport, and consumption increase during events. However, their intensities depend highly on the interplay between event characteristics and ambient groundwater conditions. During events where reversals in the hydraulic gradient occur stream water and solutes infiltrate deeper into the aquifer where they have more time to react. For those events, the reactive efficiency of the hyporheic zone (solute consumption as fraction of influx) for aerobic respiration and denitrification is up to 2.7 and 10 times higher compared to base flow conditions. The fraction of stream nitrate load consumed in the hyporheic zone increases with stream discharge (up to 150 mg/m(2)/h), but remains below the value under base flow conditions for weak events. Events also increase denitrification of groundwater borne nitrate, but groundwater nitrate flux to the stream decreases by up to 33% due to temporary gradient reversals.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394911200046,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSingle%2Bdischarge%2Bevents%2Bincrease%2Breactive%2Befficiency%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DNico%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DTrauth%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019488%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D798%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D779-798%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D779%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DTrauth%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DFleckenstein%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR019488,"hyporheic zone,discharge events,transient groundwater model,reactive transport,denitrification","RIVER-AQUIFER INTERACTIONS,4TH-ORDER MOUNTAIN STREAM,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,EXCHANGE FLUXES,STORM DYNAMICS,RIPARIAN ZONE,GROUNDWATER,NITRATE,WATER,DENITRIFICATION",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Hydrogeol, Leipzig, Germany"
5,5,"Briggs, MA",Jun 22 2010 ,Surface and hyporheic transient storage dynamics throughout a coastal stream network,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Transient storage of stream water and associated solutes is expected to vary along stream networks in response to related changes in stream hydraulic conditions and morphologic gradients. These spatial changes are relevant to a wide variety of processes (e. g., biogeochemical cycling), yet data regarding these dynamics are limited and almost exclusively confined to the general storage terms of transient storage models with a single-storage zone (1-SZ). We used a transient storage model with two-storage zones (2-SZ) to simulate field data from conservative solute injections conducted in a coastal stream network in Massachusetts to separately quantify surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS). Solute tracer additions were performed at basin-wide, low-flow conditions, and results were compared with respect to stream size. Strong positive relationships with reach contributing area indicated that the size of the main channel and the size and residence time in surface and hyporheic storage zones all increased from small to large streams. Conversely, longitudinal dispersion and the storage zone exchange coefficients had no consistent trends downstream. The influence of storage exchange on median transport time (F-MED(200)) was consistently large for STS and negligible for HTS. When compared to 1-SZ model estimates, we found that the general 1-SZ model storage terms did not consistently describe either STS or HTS exchange. Overall our results indicated that many zone-specific (STS and HTS) storage dynamics were sensitive to the combination of hydraulic and morphologic gradients along the stream network and followed positive trends with stream size.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000279315900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW06516%26rft.atitle%3DSurface%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bdynamics%2Bthroughout%2Ba%2Bcoastal%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%26rft.aufirst%3DMartin%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DBriggs%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009WR008222%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DBriggs%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DHopkinson%252C%2BCS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2009WR008222,,"RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS,WATER EXCHANGE,RETENTION,NITROGEN,DENITRIFICATION,TRANSPORT,OREGON,RIVER,ZONE",,"Colorado Sch Mines, Hydrol Sci & Engn Program, Golden, CO 80401 USA"
6,6,"Ward, AS",Dec 20 2019 ,Spatial and temporal variation in river corridor exchange across a 5th-order mountain stream network,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Although most field and modeling studies of river corridor exchange have been conducted at scales ranging from tens to hundreds of meters, results of these studies are used to predict their ecological and hydrological influences at the scale of river networks. Further complicating prediction, exchanges are expected to vary with hydrologic forcing and the local geomorphic setting. While we desire predictive power, we lack a complete spatiotemporal relationship relating discharge to the variation in geologic setting and hydrologic forcing that is expected across a river basin. Indeed, the conceptual model of Wondzell (2011) predicts systematic variation in river corridor exchange as a function of (1) variation in baseflow over time at a fixed location, (2) variation in discharge with location in the river network, and (3) local geomorphic setting. To test this conceptual model we conducted more than 60 solute tracer studies including a synoptic campaign in the 5th-order river network of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, USA) and replicate-intime experiments in four watersheds. We interpret the data using a series of metrics describing river corridor exchange and solute transport, testing for consistent direction and magnitude of relationships relating these metrics to discharge and local geomorphic setting. We confirmed systematic decrease in river corridor exchange space through the river networks, from headwaters to the larger main stem. However, we did not find systematic variation with changes in discharge through time or with local geomorphic setting. While interpretation of our results is complicated by problems with the analytical methods, the results are sufficiently robust for us to conclude that space-for-time and time-for-space substitutions are not appropriate in our study system. Finally, we suggest two strategies that will improve the interpretability of tracer test results and help the hyporheic community develop robust datasets that will enable comparisons across multiple sites and/or discharge conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000504011700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Band%2Btemporal%2Bvariation%2Bin%2Briver%2Bcorridor%2Bexchange%2Bacross%2Ba%2B5th-order%2Bmountain%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-23-5199-2019%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D5225%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5199-5225%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5199%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DWisnoski%252C%2BNI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/hess-23-5199-2019,,"SCALE TRANSIENT STORAGE,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,CASCADE MOUNTAINS,GEOMORPHIC CONTROLS,MASS-TRANSFER,FLOW,ZONE,PARAMETERS",,"Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA"
7,7,"Bakke, PD",Feb 2020 ,Hyporheic Process Restoration: Design and Performance of an Engineered Streambed,WATER,"Stream restoration designed specifically to enhance hyporheic processes has seldom been contemplated. To gain experience with hyporheic restoration, an engineered streambed was built using a gravel mixture formulated to mimic natural streambed composition, filling an over-excavated channel to a minimum depth of 90 cm. Specially designed plunge-pool structures, built with subsurface gravel extending down to 2.4 m, promoted greatly enhanced hyporheic circulation, path length, and residence time. Hyporheic process enhancement was verified using intra-gravel temperature mapping to document the distribution and strength of upwelling and downwelling zones, computation of vertical water flux using diurnal streambed temperature patterns, estimation of hyporheic zone cross section using sodium chloride tracer studies, and repeat measurements of streambed sand content to document evolution of the engineered streambed over time. Results showed that vertical water flux in the vicinity of plunge -pool structures was quite large, averaging 89 times the pre -construction rate, and 17 times larger than maximum rates measured in a pristine stream in Idaho. Upwelling and downwelling strengths in the constructed channel were larger and more spatially diverse than in the control. Streambed sand content showed a variety of response over time, indicating that rapid return to an embedded, impermeable state is not occurring.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000519846500116,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B425%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BProcess%2BRestoration%253A%2BDesign%2Band%2BPerformance%2Bof%2Ban%2BEngineered%2BStreambed%26rft.aufirst%3DPaul%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DPD%26rft.aulast%3DBakke%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12020425%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DBakke%252C%2BPD%26rft.au%3DHrachovec%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLynch%252C%2BKD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w12020425,"hyporheic,hyporheic zone restoration,stream restoration,urban watercourse restoration,streambed temperature,tracer studies,streambed grain-size distribution,vertical water flux","PACIFIC-NORTHWEST,DENITRIFICATION,EXCHANGE,RIVERS,ZONE,HABITAT,GEOMORPHOLOGY,TEMPERATURE,SCIENCE,SALMON",,"Sci Rivers, 4031 Wexford Loop SE, Olympia, WA 98501 USA"
8,8,"Uzarski, DG",May 2004 ,The importance of hyporheic sediment respiration in several mid-order Michigan rivers: comparison between methods in estimates of lotic metabolism,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Metabolism was measured in four Michigan streams, comparing estimates made using a flow-through chamber designed to include the hyporheic zone to a 20 cm depth and a traditional closed chamber that enclosed to a 5 cm depth. Mean levels of gross primary productivity and community respiration were consistently greater in the flow-through chamber than the closed chamber in all streams. Ratios of productivity to respiration (P/R) were consistently greater in the closed chambers than the flow-through chambers. P/R ratios were consistently <1 in all streams when estimated with flow-through chambers, suggesting heterotrophic conditions. Maintenance of stream ecosystem structure and function therefore is dependent on subsidies either from the adjacent terrestrial system or upstream sources. Our results suggest that stream metabolism studies that rely on extrapolation of closed chambers to the whole reach will most likely underestimate gross primary productivity and community respiration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000220977100005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bimportance%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bsediment%2Brespiration%2Bin%2Bseveral%2Bmid-order%2BMichigan%2Brivers%253A%2Bcomparison%2Bbetween%2Bmethods%2Bin%2Bestimates%2Bof%2Blotic%2Bmetabolism%26rft.aufirst%3DDG%26rft.auinit%3DDG%26rft.aulast%3DUzarski%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FB%253AHYDR.0000025056.18736.d6%26rft.epage%3D57%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1-3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D47-57%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D47%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D518%26rft.au%3DUzarski%252C%2BDG%26rft.au%3DStricker%252C%2BCA%26rft.au%3DSteinman%252C%2BAD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1023/B:HYDR.0000025056.18736.d6,"stream metabolism,gross primary productivity,community respiration,hyporheic zone,P/R ratio","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,TEMPERATE STREAM ECOSYSTEM,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,SURFACE-WATER,COMMUNITY RESPIRATION,MOUNTAIN STREAM,PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY,CONTINUUM CONCEPT,ZONE,EXCHANGE",,"Grand Valley State Univ, Annis Water Resources Inst, 740 W Shoreline Dr, Muskegon, MI 49441 USA"
9,9,"Bencala, KE",Mar 26 2011 ,Rethinking hyporheic flow and transient storage to advance understanding of stream-catchment connections,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Although surface water and groundwater are increasingly referred to as one resource, there remain environmental and ecosystem needs to study the 10 m to 1 km reach scale as one hydrologic system. Streams gain and lose water over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Large spatial scales (kilometers) have traditionally been recognized and studied as river-aquifer connections. Over the last 25 years hyporheic exchange flows (1-10 m) have been studied extensively. Often a transient storage model has been used to quantify the physical solute transport setting in which biogeochemical processes occur. At the longer 10mto 1 km scale of stream reaches it is now clear that streams which gain water overall can coincidentally lose water to the subsurface. At this scale, the amounts of water transferred are not necessarily significant but the exchanges can, however, influence solute transport. The interpretation of seemingly straightforward questions about water, contaminant, and nutrient fluxes into and along a stream can be confounded by flow losses which are too small to be apparent in stream gauging and along flow paths too long to be detected in tracer experiments. We suggest basic hydrologic approaches, e. g., measurement of flow along the channel, surface and subsurface solute sampling, and routine measurements of the water table that, in our opinion, can be used to extend simple exchange concepts from the hyporheic exchange scale to a scale of stream-catchment connection.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000288874900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW00H03%26rft.atitle%3DRethinking%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Band%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bto%2Badvance%2Bunderstanding%2Bof%2Bstream-catchment%2Bconnections%26rft.aufirst%3DKenneth%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DKE%26rft.aulast%3DBencala%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR010066%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DBencala%252C%2BKE%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DKimball%252C%2BBA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2010WR010066,,"RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,ZONE,EXCHANGE,USA,ECOLOGY,TRACER,OREGON,CREEK",,"US Geol Survey, MS 466,345 Middlefield Rd,Menlo Pk, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA"
10,10,"Zimmer, MA",Feb 15 2014 ,Temporal and spatial response of hyporheic zone geochemistry to a storm event,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Although there has been recent focus on understanding spatial variability in hyporheic zone geochemistry across different morphological units under baseflow conditions, less attention has been paid to temporal responses of hyporheic zone geochemistry to non-steady-state conditions. We documented spatial and temporal variability of hyporheic zone geochemistry in response to a large-scale storm event, Tropical Storm Irene (August 2011), across a pool-riffle-pool sequence along Chittenango Creek in Chittenango, NY, USA. We sampled stream water as well as pore water at 15cm depth in the streambed at 14 locations across a 30 m reach. Sampling occurred seven times at daily intervals: once during baseflow conditions, once during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph, and five times during the receding limb. Principal component analysis was used to interpret temporal and spatial changes and dominant drivers in stream and pore water geochemistry (n=111). Results show the majority of spatial variance in hyporheic geochemistry (62%) is driven by differential mixing of stream and ground water in the hyporheic zone. The second largest driver (17%) of hyporheic geochemistry was temporal dilution and enrichment of infiltrating stream water during the storm. Hyporheic sites minimally influenced by discharging groundwater (connected' sites) showed temporal changes in water chemistry in response to the storm event. Connected sites within and upstream of the riffle reflected stream geochemistry throughout the storm, whereas downstream sites showed temporally lagged responses in some conservative and biogeochemically reactive solutes. This suggests temporal changes in hyporheic geochemistry at these locations reflect a combination of changes in infiltrating stream chemistry and hyporheic flowpath length and residence time. The portion of the study area strongly influenced by groundwater discharge increased in size throughout the storm, producing elevated Ca2+ and SO42- concentrations in the streambed, suggesting zones of localized groundwater inputs expand in response to storms.

11,11,"Wang, P",Dec 2017 ,Estimating groundwater-ephemeral stream exchange in hyper-arid environments: Field experiments and numerical simulations,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Surface water infiltration from ephemeral dryland streams is particularly important in hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical processes in arid and semi-arid regions. However, streamflow transmission losses can vary significantly, partly due to spatiotemporal variations in streambed permeability. To extend our understanding of changes in streambed hydraulic properties, field investigations of streambed hydraulic conductivity were conducted in an ephemeral dryland stream in north-western China during high and low streamflow periods. Additionally, streamflow transmission losses were numerically estimated using combined stream and groundwater hydraulic head data and stream and streambed temperature data. An analysis of slug test data at two different river flow stages (one test was performed at a low river stage with clean water and the other at a high river stage with muddy water) suggested that sedimentation from fine-grained particles, i.e., physical clogging processes, likely led to a reduction in streambed hydraulic properties. To account for the effects of streambed clogging on changes in hydraulic properties, an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance during the slug test was considered to correct the estimation of streambed hydraulic conductivity. The stream and streambed temperature can also greatly influence the hydraulic properties of the streambed. One-dimensional coupled water and heat flux modelling with HYDRUS-1D was used to quantify the effects of seasonal changes in stream and streambed temperature on streamflow losses. During the period from 6 August 2014 to 4 June 2015, the total infiltration estimated using temperature-dependent hydraulic conductivity accounted for approximately 88% of that using temperature-independent hydraulic conductivity. Streambed clogging processes associated with fine particle settling/wash up cycles during flow events, and seasonal changes in streamflow temperature are two considerable factors that affect water infiltration in ephemeral dryland streams. Our results show that time series measurements of stream and sediment temperature and surface and groundwater head can be used to effectively determine the seasonal dynamics of streambed water exchange. Such combined heat and head monitoring at field sites is useful for calibrating regional surface-groundwater models. The results of this study may provide insights into hyporheic exchange in ephemeral dryland streams. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

12,12,"Malcolm, IA",Apr 2010 ,Hyporheic zone processes in a canalised agricultural stream: implications for salmonid embryo survival,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Agricultural practices have the potential to influence hyporheic exchange through increased fine sediment loads and through reduced hydraulic conductivity, bed roughness and morphological diversity. These impacts can reduce connectivity between stream and hyporheic waters to the detriment of salmonid embryos. Salmonids bury their eggs in streambed gravels, typically to depths of up to 300 mm and for incubation periods of up to 6 months. Embryo survival is dependant on a complex range of factors which critically includes the delivery of oxygen from surface waters. This paper investigates hyporheic zone exchange processes, oxygen concentration and embryo survival in a canalised agricultural stream at a range of nested spatiotemporal scales. Results are contrasted with those from the Girnock Burn, a relatively undisturbed catchment. Conservative tracer experiments were used to assess reach average hyporheic exchange using the USGS OTIS model. Artificial redds were used to assess reach scale variability in hyporheic processes. Incubation stacks were used to assess embryo mortality and hyporheic water quality with depth at the scale of individual redds. Optodes (optical dissolved oxygen sensors) were used at a sub-set of sites to assess fine scale temporal variability in hyporheic oxygen and temperature. Stream and hyporheic hydrochemistry were used to infer source water contributions and provenance. Data showed that reach average hyporheic exchange in the Newmills Burn was ca. five times less than in the Girnock Burn. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations related strongly to spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater (GW) discharge. Embryo survival was significantly correlated with DO. It is suggested that low DO in the Newmills Burn relates to groundwater upwelling and limited hyporheic exchange caused by a combination of low morphological diversity, hydraulic conductivity and bed roughness. It is suggested that future studies of embryo survival should look beyond the single issue of fine sediment effects to include a broader understanding of hyporheic zone processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000281759300004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bzone%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Ba%2Bcanalised%2Bagricultural%2Bstream%253A%2Bimplications%2Bfor%2Bsalmonid%2Bembryo%2Bsurvival%26rft.aufirst%3DI.%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DIA%26rft.aulast%3DMalcolm%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F1863-9135%252F2010%252F0176-0319%26rft.epage%3D336%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D319-336%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D319%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D176%26rft.au%3DMalcolm%252C%2BIA%26rft.au%3DMiddlemas%252C%2BCA%26rft.au%3DYoungson%252C%2BAF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0176-0319,"fine sediment loads,bed roughness,reduced hydraulic conductivity,oxygen concentration,groundwater,surface waters,optodes","SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,TO-FRY SURVIVAL,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN,GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,SPAWNING GRAVELS,EXCHANGE FLOWS,PACIFIC SALMON,FINE SEDIMENT,CHUM SALMON,SEA-TROUT",,"Marine Scotland Freshwater Lab, Pitlochry PH16 5LB, Perth, Scotland"
13,13,"Yellen, B",Jul 15 2015 ,Hydropeaking induces losses from a river reach: observations at multiple spatial scales,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In humid regions, where gaining river conditions generally prevail, daily hydroelectric dam releases alter downstream surface water-groundwater interactions by reversing the head gradient between river and adjacent groundwater. Previously, it has been noted that artificial stage changes due to dam releases enhance hyporheic exchange. Here we investigate the regulated Deerfield River in northwestern Massachusetts at multiple scales to evaluate how changing downstream geologic conditions along the river mediate this artificial hyporheic pumping. Water budget analysis indicates that roughly 10% of bank-stored water is permanently lost from the 19.5-km river reach, likely as a result of transpiration by bank vegetation. An adjacent reference stream with similar dimensions and geomorphology, but without hydropeaking, shows predictable gaining conditions. Field observations from streambed piezometers and thermistors show that water losses are not uniform throughout the study reach. Riparian aquifer transmissivity in river sub-reaches largely determines the magnitude of surface water-groundwater exchange as well as net water loss from the river. These newly documented losses from hydropeaking river systems should inform decisions by river managers and hydroelectric operators of additional tradeoffs of oscillatory dam-release river management.

14,14,"Morris, MR",Sep 2010 ,Successional changes in soil and hyporheic nitrogen fertility on an alluvial flood plain: implications for riparian vegetation,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"In floodplain primary succession, vegetation colonizes nitrogen-poor alluvial deposits and fertility improves as soil nitrogen accumulates over time. It is generally assumed that vegetation assimilates the vast majority of its nitrogen from the soil; however, recent studies have suggested that the hyporheic zone also may be an important nitrogen source. We investigated the potential relative importance of hyporheic nitrogen by comparing fertility indices, specifically total (TN), dissolved inorganic (DIN), potentially mineralizable (PMN) and ion exchange resin nitrogen (IERN) in both soils and the hyporheic zone at early, mid and late succession stands on an expansive river flood plain. We also constructed mesocosms to assess growth of cottonwood cuttings with access to soil and/or hyporheic water. We found TN and PMN increased from early to mid succession in both the soil (to 10 cm) and hyporheic zone (in a 10 cm layer). While TN, DIN and PMN were an order of magnitude higher in the soil than in the hyporheic zone, IERN was higher in the hyporheic zone, indicating that subsurface flow through the flood plain may be important in delivering nitrogen to the root zone. However, even when flux was added to the hyporheic PMN pool, nitrogen availability in the hyporheic zone (in a 10 cm layer) was vastly lower than soil PMN (to 10 cm). Further, the instantaneous standing stock of DIN in the surface soil alone was about equal to the sum of the DIN pool, the mean subsurface flux and the PMN pool in a 10 cm layer of hyporheic zone. In the mesocosm experiment, cottonwood cuttings with access to both soil and hyporheic water grew fastest; however, they also had the lowest foliar nitrogen concentrations, indicating that this was not due to greater nitrogen availability. In the field, nitrogen content of cottonwood foliage increased along with soil (but potentially hyporheic as well) nitrogen accumulation during succession, suggesting the vegetation responded to increasing nitrogen fertility. We conclude that at least on a per unit-volume basis, the hyporheic zone probably provides little nitrogen relative to the surface soil, except on new alluvial bars that characteristically are nitrogen poor. Therefore, the hyporheic zone is probably a much smaller nitrogen source for mature forests relative to the surface soil unless the vegetation exploits a much larger volume of the hyporheic zone than surface soil.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000281934200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSuccessional%2Bchanges%2Bin%2Bsoil%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bnitrogen%2Bfertility%2Bon%2Ban%2Balluvial%2Bflood%2Bplain%253A%2Bimplications%2Bfor%2Briparian%2Bvegetation%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DMR%26rft.aulast%3DMorris%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-010-0153-8%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D532%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D519-532%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D519%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D72%26rft.au%3DMorris%252C%2BMR%26rft.au%3DBrouwer%252C%2BBO%26rft.au%3DStanford%252C%2BJA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00027-010-0153-8,"Flood plain,River,Nitrogen,Soil,Hyporheic,Ground water,Populus,Riparian","ION-EXCHANGE-RESIN,RIVER,STREAM,ACCUMULATION,GROUNDWATER,NITRATE,GROWTH,WATER,ZONE,AVAILABILITY",,"Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, 32125 Bio Stn Lane, Polson, MT 59860 USA"
15,15,"Fernald, AG",Jun 2001 ,"Transient storage and hyporheic flow along the Willamette River, Oregon: Field measurements and model estimates",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Transient storage is a measure of the exchange of main channel flow with subsurface hyporheic flow and surface water dead zones. Hyporheic flow, in which river water enters the channel bed and banks to reemerge downstream, promotes biochemical processes that are important for water quality and aquatic habitat. Previous studies have quantified transient storage and hyporheic flow on small streams but were not specifically developed to identify both of these processes over long reaches of large rivers. We studied transient storage on the eighth-order upper Willamette River, which flows through high-porosity gravel deposits conducive to hyporheic flow. We used main channel dye tracer studies and solute transport modeling to estimate transient storage on nine study reaches in a 26-km-long study area. We also took dye measurements within the transient storage zone to identify transient storage Bow paths. We obtained estimates of transient storage exchange coefficient, alpha (s) (mean equals 1.6 x 10(-4) s(-1)), and transient storage to main channel cross-sectional area, A(s)/A (mean equal to 0.28), that show that significant amounts of water follow flow paths with 0.2-30 hour transient storage zone residence times. Our dye measurements from the transient storage zone itself showed the occurrence of both subsurface and surface flow paths, confirming that hyporheic flow is an important component of estimated transient storage. We found that the two highest A(s)/A estimates were for reaches that spanned the only length of active main channel in our study area that is unconstrained and where the river can rework large gravel deposits. Much of the natural channel complexity that historically promoted hyporheic flow no longer exists on the upper Willamette River. River management targeting the ecological functions provided by hyporheic flow might best focus on restoring historic hydrogeomorphic processes for creating sites conducive to hyporheic flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000168845200012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTransient%2Bstorage%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Balong%2Bthe%2BWillamette%2BRiver%252C%2BOregon%253A%2BField%2Bmeasurements%2Band%2Bmodel%2Bestimates%26rft.aufirst%3DAG%26rft.auinit%3DAG%26rft.aulast%3DFernald%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2000WR900338%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1694%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1681-1694%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1681%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D37%26rft.au%3DFernald%252C%2BAG%26rft.au%3DWigington%252C%2BPJ%26rft.au%3DLanders%252C%2BDH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2000WR900338,,"SALMON ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH,SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,STREAMBED SEDIMENT,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,MASS-TRANSFER,SURFACE,DENITRIFICATION,AQUIFER,ZONE",,"New Mexico State Univ, Sustainable Agr Sci Sct, POB 159, Alcalde, NM 87511 USA"

We investigated streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) with two connected depths in three rivers of Nebraska. Our results demonstrated that streambed K-v in the upper sediment layer was much higher than that in the sediment of the lower layer. We speculate that hyporheic processes can result in larger streambed K-v in the upper layer. Specifically, water exchange through upwelling and downwelling zones can lead to bigger pore spaces and a more unconsolidated structure of sediments in the upper layer. The upward movement of gas produced by redox processes can loosen the sediments and further enlarge pore spaces in the upper layers. Also, permeability can increase as a result of expanded pore spaces caused by invertebrate activities in the upper part of streambed. The higher K-v will likely enhance exchange processes between stream and sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000245726600005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BL07409%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bprocesses%2Bon%2Bstreambed%2Bvertical%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bin%2Bthree%2Brivers%2Bof%2BNebraska%26rft.aufirst%3DJinxi%26rft.auinit%3DJX%26rft.aulast%3DSong%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2007GL029254%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXH%26rft.au%3DWen%252C%2BFJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2007GL029254,,"GAS-BUBBLES,ZONE,INVERTEBRATES,EXCHANGE,WATER,GROUNDWATER,AQUIFERS,FAUNA",,"Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, 623 Hardin Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA"
17,17,"Cornut, J",Dec 2010 ,Early stages of leaf decomposition are mediated by aquatic fungi in the hyporheic zone of woodland streams,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Leaf litter constitutes the major source of organic matter and energy in woodland stream ecosystems. A substantial part of leaf litter entering running waters may be buried in the streambed as a consequence of flooding and sediment movement. While decomposition of leaf litter in surface waters is relatively well understood, its fate when incorporated into river sediments, as well as the involvement of invertebrate and fungal decomposers in such conditions, remain poorly documented.2. We tested experimentally the hypotheses that the small interstices of the sediment restrict the access of the largest shredders to buried organic matter without compromising that of aquatic hyphomycetes and that fungal decomposers in the hyporheic zone, at least partly, compensate for the role of invertebrate detritivores in the benthic zone.3. Alder leaves were introduced in a stream either buried in the sediment (hyporheic), buried after 2 weeks of exposure at the sediment surface (benthic-hyporheic), or exposed at the sediment surface for the entire experiment (benthic). Leaf decomposition was markedly faster on the streambed surface than in the two other treatments (2.1- and 2.8-fold faster than in the benthic-hyporheic and hyporheic treatments, respectively).4. Fungal assemblages were generally less diverse in the hyporheic habitat with a few species tending to be relatively favoured by such conditions. Both fungal biomass and sporulation rates were reduced in the hyporheic treatment, with the leaves subject to the benthic-hyporheic treatment exhibiting an intermediate pattern. The initial 2-week stage in the benthic habitat shaped the fungal assemblages, even for leaves later subjected to the hyporheic conditions.5. The abundance and biomass of shredders drastically decreased with burial, except for Leuctra spp., which increased and was by far the most common leaf-associated taxon in the hyporheic zone. Leuctra spp. was one of the rare shredder taxa displaying morphological characteristics that increased performance within the limited space of sediment interstices.6. The carbon budgets indicated that the relative contributions of the two main decomposers, shredders and fungi, varied considerably depending on the location within the streambed. While the shredder biomass represented almost 50% of the initial carbon transformed after 80 days in the benthic treatment, its contribution was < 0.3% in the hyporheic one and 2.0% in the combined benthic-hyporheic treatment. In contrast, mycelial and conidial production in the permanently hyporheic environment accounted for 12% of leaf mass loss, i.e. 2-3 times more than in the two other conditions. These results suggest that the role of fungi is particularly important in the hyporheic zone.7. Our findings indicate that burial within the substratum reduces the litter breakdown rate by limiting the access of both invertebrate and fungal decomposers to leaves. As a consequence, the hyporheic zone may be an important region of organic matter storage in woodland streams and serve as a fungal inoculum reservoir contributing to further dispersal. Through the temporary retention of litter by burial, the hyporheic zone must play a significant role in the carbon metabolism and overall functioning of headwater stream ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000283725300009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEarly%2Bstages%2Bof%2Bleaf%2Bdecomposition%2Bare%2Bmediated%2Bby%2Baquatic%2Bfungi%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bwoodland%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJulien%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DCornut%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2010.02483.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D2556%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2541-2556%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2541%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DCornut%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DElger%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DChauvet%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02483.x,"aquatic hyphomycetes,litter breakdown,organic matter,river sediment,shredders","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,ORGANIC-MATTER STORAGE,LITTER BREAKDOWN,DECAYING FUNGI,LOW-GRADIENT,DEAD LEAVES,DRY MASS,INVERTEBRATES,BIOMASS,RIVER",,"Lab Ecol Fonct, 29 Rue Jeanne Marvig, F-31055 Toulouse, France"
18,18,"Palumbo-Roe, B",Jun 2013 ,The hyporheic zone composition of a mining-impacted stream: Evidence by multilevel sampling and DGT measurements,APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"The importance of the hyporheic zone in influencing stream solute loads and stream ecosystems has been increasingly recognised. The hyporheic zone physicochemical composition of a stream stretch of the Rookhope Burn, a tributary of the River Wear in the North Pennines, UK, affected by historical mining of Pb ore, was characterised at two contrasting flow and temperature regimes. Vertical element concentration gradients were obtained using multilevel samplers down to a depth of 40 cm below the water-sediment boundary. Additional in situ Diffuse Gradients in Thin films (DGT) measurements of surface water and pore water were obtained.Circumneutral pH and oxidising conditions characterised the hyporheic zone of the study reach, composed of coarse-textured bed sediments. The surface hyporheic zone (top 15-20 cm) was dominated by the chemistry of the overlying water, while interactions with the solid phase were important for some elements in the deeper section of the hyporheic zone.Manganese was attenuated in the hyporheic zone as shown by SEM analysis of Mn-rich grain coatings from the bed sediment. Fine resolution data obtained through the use of the DGT probe deployed in the sediment at one sampling location, showed localised loss in Mn and Zn concentrations at 1.5-4.5 cm below the water-sediment interface. There was clear evidence for hyporheic pore water enrichment in Pb, which was unaffected seasonally, while Zn was greater in the summer sampling. These temporal variations of the hyporheic zone composition warrant consideration when accounting for the contribution of disperse inputs to mining impacted catchments, highlighting the need for hyporheic zone studies taking into account differences in seasons.The significance of the observed sediment-scale hyporheic processes on the reach-scale geochemical mass balance was estimated by using surface water geochemical loading calculations. Water metal mass balance from four previous sampling events indicated a constant loss of Mn load, a continuous gain of Pb load and a more temporally variable loss of Zn load for a 700 m stream stretch which included the study site. These results closely agreed with the present observations at the stream bed sediment scale, supporting the importance of hyporheic dynamic solute exchanges in affecting surface water quality for the study stream.

It also plays a role in the energy balance of rivers. To complement previous theoretical studies, we investigated the effects of hyporheic flow due to bed topography on hyporheic thermal dynamics through flume experiments. Diel temperature cycles were imposed in the channel and propagation of temperature signals into the sediment was examined for three different bed morphologies (flat bed, pool-riffle-pool, and rippled bed), three-channel flow rates, and two sediment grain sizes. Results show that the downwelling upstream and downstream of the bedforms and upwelling focused near the crest caused substantial advective heat transport and distinct thermal patterns in the sediment, with downwelling zones reflecting most of the surface water diel thermal range whereas upwelling zones were more buffered. Increasing permeability and channel flow rates increased advective transport. The results corroborate previous theoretical models further showing that hyporheic flow distinctly affects thermal patchiness in sediment. The results also have implications for heat tracing using analytical models which work well for flow fields without pronounced divergence and convergence and minimal dispersion, features atypical of hyporheic flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000336026000046,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHeat%2Btransport%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%2Bdue%2Bto%2Bbedforms%253A%2BAn%2Bexperimental%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DFrancis%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DFA%26rft.aulast%3DNorman%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR014673%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D3582%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3568-3582%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3568%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DNorman%252C%2BFA%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR014673,"hyporheic zone,heat transport,streambed,bedform,hyporheic exchange,temperature","TEMPERATURE TIME-SERIES,STREAMBED TEMPERATURES,LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS,GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,METAL CONCENTRATIONS,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,EPHEMERAL CHANNELS,DIEL CYCLES,WATER FLUX",,"Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA"
20,20,"Musial, CT",Feb 28 2016 ,Surface water-groundwater exchange dynamics in a tidal freshwater zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In coastal rivers, tides can propagate for tens to hundreds of kilometres inland beyond the saltwater line. Yet the influence of tides on river-aquifer connectivity and solute transport in tidal freshwater zones (TFZs) is largely unknown. We estimate that along the TFZ of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA), 11% of river water exchanges through tidal bank storage zones. Additional hyporheic processes such as flow through bedforms likely contribute even more exchange. The turnover length associated with tidal bank storage is 150km, on the order of turnover lengths for all hyporheic exchange processes in non-tidal rivers of similar size. Based on measurements at a transect of piezometers located 17km from the coast, tides exchange 0.36m(3) of water across the banks and 0.86m(3) across the bed per unit river length. Exchange fluxes range from -1.66 to 2.26mday(-1) across the bank and -0.84 to 1.88mday(-1) across the bed. During rising tide, river water infiltrates into the riparian aquifer, and the downstream transport rate in the channel is low. During falling tide, stored groundwater is released to the river, and the downstream transport rate in the channel increases. Tidal bank storage zones may remove nutrients or other contaminants from river water and attenuate nutrient loads to coasts. Alternating expansion and contraction of aerobic zones in the riparian aquifer likely influence contaminant removal along flow paths. A clear need exists to understand contaminant removal and other ecosystem services in TFZs and adopt best management practices to promote these ecosystem services.

The present study aims at checking the elimination potential and analyzing the coupling of hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and micropollutant processing. To this end, two sites at the lowland stream Erpe, which receives a high sewage burden, were equipped and sampled with nested piezometers. From temperature depth profiles we determined that at one of the sites infiltration of surface water into the aquifer occurs while exfiltration dominates at the other site. Biogeochemical data reveal intense mineralization processes and strictly anoxic conditions in the streambed sediments at both sites. Concentrations of the pharmaceuticals indomethacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, bezafibrate, ketoprofen, naproxen and clofibric acid were high in the surface water and also in the subsurface at the infiltrating site. The evaluation of the depth profiles indicates some attenuation but due to varying surface water composition the evaluation of subsurface processes is quite complex. Borate and non-geogenic gadolinium were measured as conservative wastewater indicators. To eliminate the influence of fluctuating sewage proportions in the surface water, micropollutant concentrations are related to these indicators. The indicators can cope with different dilutions of the sewage but not with temporally varying sewage composition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The present study examined the effect of constructed riffles and a step on hyporheic exchange flow and chemistry in restored reaches of several N-rich agricultural and urban streams in southern Ontario. Hydrometric data collected from a network of piezometers and conservative tracer releases indicated that the constructed riffles and steps were effective in inducing hyporheic exchange. However, despite the use of cobbles and boulders in the riffle construction, high stream dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were depleted rapidly with depth into the hyporheic zones. Differences between observed and predicted nitrate concentrations based on conservative ion concentration patterns indicated that these hyporheic zones were also nitrate sinks. Zones of low hydraulic conductivity and the occurrence of interstitial fines in the restored cobble-boulder layers suggest that siltation and clogging of the streambed may reduce the downwelling of oxygen- and nitrate-rich stream water. Increases in streambed DO levels and enhancement of habitat for hyporheic fauna that result from riffle-step construction projects may only be temporary in streams that receive increased sediment and nutrient inputs from urban areas and croplands.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000235231400010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Briffle-step%2Brestoration%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bchemistry%2Bin%2BN-rich%2Blowland%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DT%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DKasahara%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252FF05-199%26rft.eissn%3D1205-7533%26rft.epage%3D133%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D120-133%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D120%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D63%26rft.au%3DKasahara%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DHill%252C%2BAR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1139/F05-199,,"GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,WATER EXCHANGE,SURFACE,DENITRIFICATION,RETENTION,FLOW,TOPOGRAPHY,TRANSPORT,HABITAT",,"Utah State Univ, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources, 5210 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA"
23,23,"Xu, SF",Mar 2017 ,Variability of Darcian Flux in the Hyporheic Zone at a Natural Channel Bend,WATER,"Channel bends are one of the most important characteristic features of natural streams. These bends often create the conditions for a hyporheic zone, which has been recognized as a critical component of stream ecosystems. The streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v), vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and Darcian flux (DF) in the hyporheic zone were estimated at 61 locations along a channel bend of the Beiluo River during July 2015 and January 2016. All the streambed attributes showed great spatial variability along the channel bend. Both upward fluxes and downward fluxes occurred during the two test periods, most of studied stream sections were controlled by downwelling, indicating stream water discharge into the subsurface. The average downward flux was higher at the downstream side than at the upstream side of the channel bend, especially in July 2015. The distribution of streambed sediment grain size has a significant influence on the variability of K-v; high percentages of silt and clay sediments generally lead to low K-v values. Higher K-v at the depositional left bank at the upstream site shifted toward the erosional right bank at the downstream site, with K-v values positively correlated with the water depth. This study suggested that the variabilities of K-v and VHG were influenced by the stream geomorphology and that the distribution of K-v was inversely related, to a certain extent, to the distribution of VHG across the channel bend. K-v and VHG were found to have opposite effects on the DF, and the close relationship between K-v and DF indicated that the water fluxes were mainly controlled by K-v.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000398721300021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B170%26rft.atitle%3DVariability%2Bof%2BDarcian%2BFlux%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bat%2Ba%2BNatural%2BChannel%2BBend%26rft.aufirst%3DShaofeng%26rft.auinit%3DSF%26rft.aulast%3DXu%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw9030170%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2073-4441%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BSF%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DXue%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w9030170,"hyporheic zone,Darcian flux,channel bend,vertical hydraulic conductivity,stream topography,grain size,porosity","STREAMBED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,GAINING STREAM,SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,POROSITY,RIVER,FLOW,NEBRASKA,AQUIFERS",,"Northwest Univ Xian, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China"
24,24,"Cornut, J",Dec 1 2012 ,Effect of acidification on leaf litter decomposition in benthic and hyporheic zones of woodland streams,WATER RESEARCH,"Anthropogenic acidification has deleterious effects on both structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. This study examined how it may affect the leaf decomposition rate and the community structure and activity of decomposers in both benthic and hyporheic zones of five headwater streams along an acidification gradient from highly acidic (pH 4.6) to circumneutral (pH 7.4). Overall, responses to acidification in hyporheic zones were less pronounced, but followed the same pattern as in their benthic counterparts. Leaf decomposition was much faster in the circumneutral stream, both in the hyporheic and benthic zones (k = 0.0068 and 0.0534 d(-1), respectively), than in the most acidic one (k = 0.0016 and 0.0055 d(-1), respectively), and correlated well with the acidic gradient in both compartments. Interestingly, leaf litter decomposition was less affected by acidification in hyporheic compared to benthic compartments, likely due to the relatively low sensitivity of fungi, which were the main decomposers of buried coarse particulate organic matter. These results argue in favour of conserving hyporheic habitats in acidified streams as they can maintain matter and species fluxes that are essential to the ecosystem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have focused on the flux of phosphorus at the water-sediment interface, and very little is known about the transport and distribution of phosphorus in bedforms. In this study, a series of flume experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate phosphorus dynamics in the hyporheic zone. The results show that the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water decreases faster than that of conservative solutes because of sediment adsorption. It is also found that the hyporheic exchange flux of phosphorus is more sensitive to the maximum adsorption capacity than to the equilibrium isotherm distribution coefficient, and the penetration depth is inhibited at higher maximum adsorption capacity. The mass proportion of phosphorus is decreased by 19.5% in the pore water but increased by 95.9% in the sediment with the increase of the maximum adsorption capacity from 0.5 to 1. These findings provide a better understanding of the transport and distribution of phosphorus in the riverbed and the contribution of transient flows such as flood to phosphorus dynamics in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000773693900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR031292%26rft.atitle%3DTransport%2Bof%2BPhosphorus%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DGuangqiu%26rft.auinit%3DGQ%26rft.aulast%3DJin%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR031292%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BHX%26rft.au%3DTang%252C%2BHW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR031292,"phosphorus,bedform,hyporheic exchange,nonlinear adsorption,recirculating flume","WATER EXCHANGE,FRESH-WATER,SEDIMENT,NITROGEN,RIVER,EUTROPHICATION,LIMITATION,MORPHOLOGY,ADSORPTION,BASEFLOW",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Peoples R China"
26,26,"Gandy, CJ",Feb 15 2007 ,Attenuation of mining-derived pollutants in the hyporheic zone: A review,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Mine water pollution is a major cause of surface- and groundwater pollution in former mining districts throughout Europe. It is a potential barrier to achieving good status water bodies, which is a requirement of the EU Water Framework Directive. In the UK, a concerted effort has been made over the last decade or so to address the scientific and practical challenges relating to the remediation of mine water pollution. However, most of this work has focused on remediation of point sources of pollution (typically arising from abandoned mines and shafts), while the behaviour of mine water at the groundwater-surface water interface (the ""hyporheic zone"") has received far less attention in relevant scientific and engineering literature. The extent of mine water pollution and capacity for its attenuation at the hyporheic zone has not been well quantified while, furthermore, the complex chemical and microbial processes occurring there (specifically with reference to mining-derived pollutants) have not been investigated in any depth. The absence of such data may relate, in a large part, to the difficulty in physically measuring volumes and concentrations associated with these river inputs/exports. A far greater body of literature addresses biogeochemical processes at the hyporheic zone (especially relating to manganese), albeit many such articles relate to aqueous metal dynamics in general, rather than mine water specifically. This paper presents a review of the natural attenuation processes that may limit the movement and availability of mining-derived pollutants at the groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interface, and specifically within the hyporheic zone. A substantial part focuses on precipitation and adsorption processes at the hyporheic zone, as well as discussing the role of microbial processes in governing metal ion mobility.

27,27,"Reeder, WJ",Jul 2018 ,Hyporheic Source and Sink of Nitrous Oxide,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas with an estimated 10% of anthropogenic N2O coming from the hyporheic zone of streams and rivers. However, difficulty in making accurate fine-scale field measurements has prevented detailed understanding of the processes of N2O production and emission at the bedform and flowline scales. Using large-scale, replicated flume experiments that employed high-density chemical concentration measurements, we have been able to refine the current conceptualization of N2O production, consumption, and emission from the hyporheic zone. We present a predictive model based on a Damkohler-type transformation ((tau) over tilde) in which the hyporheic residence times (tau) along the flowlines are multiplied by the dissolved oxygen consumption rate constants for those flowlines. This model can identify which bedforms have the potential to produce and emit N2O, as well as the portion and location from which those emissions may occur. Our results indicate that flowlines with (tau) over tilde (up) ((tau) over tilde as the flowline returns to the surface flow) values between 0.54 and 4.4 are likely to produce and emit N2O. Flowlines with (tau) over tilde (up) values of less than 0.54 will have the same N2O as the surface water and those with values greater than 4.4 will likely sink N2O (reference conditions: 17C, surface dissolved oxygen 8.5mg/L). N2O production peaks approximately at (tau) over tilde =1.8. A cumulative density function of (tau) over tilde (up) values for all flowlines in a bedform (or multiple bedforms) can be used to estimate the portion of flowlines, and in turn the portion of the streambed, with the potential to emit N2O.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000442502100046,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BSource%2Band%2BSink%2Bof%2BNitrous%2BOxide%26rft.aufirst%3DW.%2BJeffery%26rft.auinit%3DWJ%26rft.aulast%3DReeder%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR022564%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D5016%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5001-5016%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5001%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DReeder%252C%2BWJ%26rft.au%3DQuick%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR022564,"nitrous oxide,hyporheic,predictive model","N2O EMISSIONS,STREAM,BATHYMETRY,WATER,DENITRIFICATION,TOPOGRAPHY,DYNAMICS,EXCHANGE,IMAGERY,SCALE",,"Univ Idaho, Dept Civil Engn, Moscow, ID 83843 USA"
28,28,"Jonsson, K",Jul 25 2003 ,Hyporheic exchange of reactive and conservative solutes in streams - tracer methodology and model interpretation,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A transient storage model is evaluated using results from a tracer experiment, where a conservative and a reactive tracer (H-3 and Cr-51(III)) were injected simultaneously and monitored in stream water and bed sediment. About 76% of the chromium was lost from the stream water on the reach 30 km downstream of the injection point directly after the passage of the pulse in the flowing water. The bed sediment hosted the main part of the retained chromium. The time to washout 75% of the maximum solute uptake in the sediment was similar to 85 times longer for chromium than for tritium (i.e. similar to 45 days). It was possible to describe the sediment-water exchange with a diffusive flux formulation that could be evaluated using tritium breakthrough curves in the stream water or the tritium inventory breakthrough curves in the sediment. This experiment revealed further that observations of chromium concentrations in the sediment were essential for the quantifying of sorption properties, as it was not possible to catch accurately the time scale of sorption within the duration of the breakthrough curves in the stream water. There was a clear need for a rate-limited description of the sorption of chromium in the sediment. We found that a first-order kinetic description of the sorption process could acceptably describe the breakthrough curves in both the stream water and the bed sediment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

29,29,"Fortner, SK",Jan 30 2013 ,"Diel stream geochemistry, Taylor Valley, Antarctica",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Unlike temperate and polythermal proglacial streams, the proglacial streams in Taylor Valley ( TV), Antarctica, are derived primarily from glacier surface melt with no subglacial or groundwater additions. Solute responses to flow reflect only the interaction of glacial meltwater with the valley floor surrounding the stream channel. We have investigated the major, minor and trace element 24-h variations of two proglacial melt streams, Andersen Creek and Canada Stream, originating from the Canada Glacier in TV, Antarctica. Both streams exhibited diel mid-austral summer diurnal flow variation, with maximum flow being more than 50 times the minimum flow. Dissolved (< 0.4 mu m) major, minor and trace solute behaviors through diel periods were strongly controlled by the availability of readily solubilized material on the valley floor and hyporheic-biological exchanges. Anderson Creek had generally greater solute concentrations than Canada Stream because of its greater receipt of eolian sediment. Andersen Creek also acquired greater solute concentrations in the rising limb of the hydrograph than the falling limb because of dissolution of eolian material at the surface of the stream channel coupled with minimal hyporheic-biological exchange. Conversely, Canada Stream had less available eolian sediment, but a greater hyporheic-biological exchange, which preferentially removed trace and major solutes in the rising limb and released them in the falling limb. Given the dynamic nature of discharge, eolian, and hyporheic-biological processes, solute loads in TV streams are difficult to predict.

30,30,"Jiang, QH",Aug 2020 ,Density-dependent solute transport in a layered hyporheic zone,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Hyporheic exchange is affected by bedform geometry, which induces complex flow paths within the bedform. Additional factors that influence flow and solute transport in the hyporheic zone are layered profile sediments and density-driven flow. This study explored the combined effects of these factors on hyporheic exchange through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations involving infiltrating solute displacing less-dense resident water in a layered bedform with a low permeability layer (LPL). The bedform consisted of three horizontal layers, in which the hydraulic conductivity of the middle layer (LPL) was less than that of the top (TL) and bottom layers (BL). The results demonstrated that a previously unexplored combination of mechanisms (density effects and layered bedform) produces irregular spatial patterns of solute transport in the hyporheic zone. For instance, the width of solute plume within the bottom layers becomes narrowed compared with tracer transport. With increasing density contrast between infiltrating solute and resident water, the solute plume becomes much narrower, forming fingers. Numerical modeling further shows that the hydraulic conductivity contrast (HCC) and relative thickness (RT) of the hyporheic zone layers also affect the spatial solute transport patterns. As the hydraulic conductivity contrast or relative thickness increases, the plume becomes much narrower. Horizontal ambient flow (HAF) dominated in the bottom layers, and lateral solute spreading and mixing intensified with a higher hydraulic conductivity contrast and relative thickness. Furthermore, the vertical solute plume was detached by the horizontal ambient flow in the bottom layers with a discontinuous low permeability layer, forming a discontinuous zone of vertical solute transport.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000550807600007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B103645%26rft.atitle%3DDensity-dependent%2Bsolute%2Btransport%2Bin%2Ba%2Blayered%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DQihao%26rft.auinit%3DQH%26rft.aulast%3DJiang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2020.103645%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D142%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BQH%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DBarry%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103645,"Hyporheic exchange,Layered profile,Density-driven flow,Low- permeability layer","SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,ORGANIC-CARBON,WASTE-WATER,GROUNDWATER,STREAM,FLOW,FLUXES,DISCHARGE,BEDFORMS",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Peoples R China"

32,32,"Constantz, J",Apr 2013 ,Streambed exchanges along tributary streams in humid watersheds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Tributary streams flow from the headwaters directly to the main stem in the valley axis and represent an important general stream type with high surface areas to volume and high streambed exchanges along much of their length. These characteristics strongly influence water quantity and quality in tributary streams, as well as the underlying groundwater and, eventually, the main stem. Tributary streams can be described as consisting of upland, central, and distal reaches, each with temporal trends in streambed exchanges unique to their spatial position along the tributary stream. In this work, thermal tracing and hydraulic monitoring reported in earlier works have been analyzed to compare surface-water/groundwater streambed exchange patterns along Fish Creek Wyoming (US), a well-studied tributary stream in a humid watershed. Results of this analysis demonstrate that composite thermal/hydraulic techniques successfully differentiated reach-specific streambed exchanges to distinguish upland, central, and distal reaches along Fish Creek above the Snake River. The upland and central reaches streambed exchanges were primarily vertical and horizontal streambed exchanges normal to general streamflow, while the distal reach streambed exchanges were lower in magnitude and more longitudinal in the same direction as streamflow. Heat-based streambed hydraulic conductivities were highest (and isotropic) for the upland reach and lowest (and strongly anisotropic) for the distal reach, in accordance with general downstream sediment fining approaching a main stem. These distinct reach patterns should show general transfer value, since general tributary streambed exchange patterns are expected to be influenced by proximity to headwaters in the upland reach, by buffering within alluvial fill in the central reach, and by proximity to the main stem in the distal reach.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000319282100031,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStreambed%2Bexchanges%2Balong%2Btributary%2Bstreams%2Bin%2Bhumid%2Bwatersheds%26rft.aufirst%3DJim%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DConstantz%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20194%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2204%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2197-2204%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2197%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DConstantz%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DEddy-Miller%252C%2BCA%26rft.au%3DEssaid%252C%2BHI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20194,"tributary stream,streambed exchanges,groundwater,heat tracing","GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,TEMPERATURE PROFILES,HEAT,FLOW,TRANSPORT,SOLUTE,FLUX,SUBSURFACE,SIMULATION,TRANSIENT",,"US Geol Survey, Natl Res Program, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA"
33,33,"Zachara, JM",Feb 2020 ,Kilometer-Scale Hydrologic Exchange Flows in a Gravel Bed River Corridor and Their Implications to Solute Migration,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A well-characterized field site along a major, gravel bed river corridor was used to investigate the dynamic pathways and impacts of subsurface hydrogeologic structure on kilometer-scale hydrologic exchange flows between river water and groundwater. An aqueous uranium (U-aq) plume exists within a hyporheic alluvial aquifer at the site that discharges to the Columbia River. We performed temporally intensive monitoring of specific conductance (SpC) and U-aq concentrations within the plume for a 2-year period at varying distances from the river shoreline, both within and outside a presumed subsurface pathway of lateral hydrologic exchange. SpC and U-aq were utilized as in situ tracers of hydrologic exchange and associated groundwater-surface water mixing. Seasonal river stage variations by more than 2 m caused distinct events of river water intrusion and retreat from the nearshore, hyporheic alluvial aquifer, resulting in highly dynamic SpC and U-aq patterns in monitoring wells. Simulations of hydrologic exchange and mixing were performed with PFLOTRAN to understand the observed SpC and U-aq behaviors linked to predominant flow directions and velocities in the river corridor as influenced by river stage dynamics and variable aquitard topography. By coupling robust monitoring with numerical flow and transport modeling, we demonstrate complicated multidirectional flow behaviors at the kilometer scale that strongly influenced plume dynamics. Therefore, hyporheic aquifer must be frequently monitored under different flow conditions if water quality is of concern. The resulting hydrologic understanding enables improved interpretation of hydrogeochemical data from this site and other large gravel bed river corridors in the United States and elsewhere.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000535672800040,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR025258%26rft.atitle%3DKilometer-Scale%2BHydrologic%2BExchange%2BFlows%2Bin%2Ba%2BGravel%2BBed%2BRiver%2BCorridor%2Band%2BTheir%2BImplications%2Bto%2BSolute%2BMigration%26rft.aufirst%3DJohn%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DZachara%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025258%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DZachara%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DResch%252C%2BCT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR025258,"surface water-groundwater interaction,gravel bed river corridor,hydrologic exchange,subsurface hydrogeologic structures,riverine and groundwater modeling,contaminant plume dynamics","SURFACE-WATER INTERACTIONS,HYPORHEIC ZONE,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,DAM OPERATIONS,BANK STORAGE,AQUIFER,STREAM,CONNECTIVITY,DYNAMICS,HETEROGENEITY",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA"

These invertebrate activities could loosen the thin layer of clogging sediments and result in an increase of pore size in the sediments, leading to greater vertical hydraulic conductivity of the streambed (K (v) ). The measurements of the vertical hydraulic gradient across the submerged streambed show that vertical flux in the hyporheic zone can alter directions (upward versus downward) for two locations only a few meters apart. In situ permeameter tests show that streambed K (v) in the upper sediment layer is much higher than that in the lower sediment layer, and the calculated K (v) in the submerged streambed is consistently greater than that in the clogged sediments around the shorelines of the sand bars. Moreover, a phenomenon of gas bubble release at the water-sediment interface from the subsurface sediments was observed in the groundwater seepage zone where flow velocity is extremely small. The bursting of gas bubbles can potentially break the thin clogging layer of sediments and enhance the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the streambed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000281668700011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DObservation%2Bof%2Bbioturbation%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bflux%2Bin%2Bstreambeds%26rft.aufirst%3DJinxi%26rft.auinit%3DJX%26rft.aulast%3DSong%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11783-010-0233-y%26rft.eissn%3D1673-7520%26rft.epage%3D348%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1673-7415%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BENGINEERING%2BIN%2BCHINA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D340-348%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D340%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BENVIRON%2BSCI%2BEN%26rft.volume%3D4%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXH%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+ENGINEERING+IN+CHINA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11783-010-0233-y,"invertebrate bioturbation,clogging,hyporheic exchange,streambed,the Elkhorn River","HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,GAS-BUBBLES,ZONE,SEDIMENT,GROUNDWATER,RIVER,INVERTEBRATES,ECOSYSTEMS",,"Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China"
35,35,"Byrne, P",Mar 15 2015 ,Diffusive equilibrium in thin films provides evidence of suppression of hyporheic exchange and large-scale nitrate transformation in a groundwater-fed river,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The hyporheic zone of riverbed sediments has the potential to attenuate nitrate from upwelling, polluted groundwater. However, the coarse-scale (5-10cm) measurement of nitrogen biogeochemistry in the hyporheic zone can often mask fine-scale (<1cm) biogeochemical patterns, especially in near-surface sediments, leading to incomplete or inaccurate representation of the capacity of the hyporheic zone to transform upwelling NO3-. In this study, we utilised diffusive equilibrium in thin-films samplers to capture high resolution (cm-scale) vertical concentration profiles of NO3-, SO42-, Fe and Mn in the upper 15cm of armoured and permeable riverbed sediments. The goal was to test whether nitrate attenuation was occurring in a sub-reach characterised by strong vertical (upwelling) water fluxes. The vertical concentration profiles obtained from diffusive equilibrium in thin-films samplers indicate considerable cm-scale variability in NO3- (4.4 +/- 2.9mg N/L), SO42- (9.9 +/- 3.1mg/l) and dissolved Fe (1.6 +/- 2.1mg/l) and Mn (0.2 +/- 0.2mg/l). However, the overall trend suggests the absence of substantial net chemical transformations and surface-subsurface water mixing in the shallow sediments of our sub-reach under baseflow conditions. The significance of this is that upwelling NO3--rich groundwater does not appear to be attenuated in the riverbed sediments at <15cm depth as might occur where hyporheic exchange flows deliver organic matter to the sediments for metabolic processes. It would appear that the chemical patterns observed in the shallow sediments of our sub-reach are not controlled exclusively by redox processes and/or hyporheic exchange flows. Deeper-seated groundwater fluxes and hydro-stratigraphy may be additional important drivers of chemical patterns in the shallow sediments of our study sub-reach. (c) 2015 The Authors.

36,36,"Singh, T",Aug 2020 ,Effects of Successive Peak Flow Events on Hyporheic Exchange and Residence Times,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange is a crucial control of the type and rates of streambed biogeochemical processes, including metabolism, respiration, nutrient turnover, and the transformation of pollutants. Previous work has shown that increasing discharge during an individual peak flow event strengthens biogeochemical turnover by enhancing the exchange of water and dissolved solutes. However, due to the nonsteady nature of the exchange process, successive peak flow events do not exhibit proportional variations in residence time and turnover, and in some cases, can reduce the hyporheic zones' biogeochemical potential. Here, we used a process-based model to explore the role of successive peak flow events on the flow and transport characteristics of bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. We conducted a systematic analysis of the impacts of the events' magnitude, duration, and time between peaks in the hyporheic zone's fluxes, penetration, and residence times. The relative contribution of each event to the transport of solutes across the sediment-water interface was inferred from transport simulations of a conservative solute. In addition to temporal variations in the hyporheic flow field, our results demonstrate that the separation between two events determines the temporal evolution of residence time and that event time lags longer than the memory of the system result in successive events that can be treated independently. This study highlights the importance of discharge variability in the dynamics of hyporheic exchange and its potential implications for biogeochemical transformations and fate of contaminants along river corridors.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000582701700019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR027113%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2BSuccessive%2BPeak%2BFlow%2BEvents%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Band%2BResidence%2BTimes%26rft.aufirst%3DTanu%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DSingh%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR027113%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DSingh%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR027113,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGES,STREAM DISCHARGE,STORM EVENTS,ZONE,NITRATE,DISTRIBUTIONS,PERMEABILITY,INTERFACES,PATTERNS",,"Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England"
37,37,"Jin, GQ",Nov 2018 ,Density effects on nanoparticle transport in the hyporheic zone,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"A carbon solution composed of nanoparticles (d(50) = 85.7 nm) was used in experiments designed to explore nanoparticle transport characteristics within the hyporheic zone of a riverbed. Experiments and numerical simulations demonstrated that nanoparticle transport in the hyporheic zone is affected by hydraulic head gradients due to river flow-bedform interactions as well as density gradients associated with the nano-carbon solution. Differences with similar flow/transport situations were examined, and it was found that particulate-enhanced density can change hyporheic transport appreciably. In addition to density, particle settling enhances downward movement of the nano-carbon plume in the riverbed. While nanoparticle transport in the upper hyporheic zone is largely controlled by advection due to flow driven by head gradients at the bed surface, density gradients and particle settling influence the transport process significantly in the lower hyporheic zone. During the transport process, nanoparticles become deposited due to attachment to sand particles and filtration by small pores in the bed. Compared with transport where density variations are minimal, the particulate-induced density gradient induces downward transport of nanoparticles and entrained liquids, leading to deposition/accumulation at the base of the bed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000447617000029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDensity%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bnanoparticle%2Btransport%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DGuangqiu%26rft.auinit%3DGQ%26rft.aulast%3DJin%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2018.09.004%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.epage%3D418%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D406-418%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D406%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D121%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BQH%26rft.au%3DBarry%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.09.004,"Nanoparticle,Hyporheic exchange,Density-driven flow,Settling,Attachment,Detachment,Bedform","POROUS-MEDIA,ENGINEERED NANOPARTICLES,COLLOID EXCHANGE,STREAM,AGGREGATION,ENVIRONMENT,DEPOSITION,MODEL,FLOW,BED",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"

The quantification of these hydraulic interactions is absolutely necessary for achieving sustainable water use and requires accurate analytical methodologies. This report proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the quantitative and qualitative characterization of hydraulic interactions between rivers and shallow aquifers, wherein it outlines the advantages of coupling groundwater modeling with biological markers. As a first step, we built independent diagnostic maps of hydrological exchanges at the sector scale on the basis of hydrogeological modeling and biological indicators. In a second step, these maps were compared to provide a quantitative and qualitative understanding of exchanges between groundwater and surface water. This comparison significantly improved the calibration of groundwater models through a better assessment of boundary zones. Our approach enabled us to identify the conditions under which it could be possible to use biological indicators instead of a large set of piezometric measures. The integration of such combined tools in a future decision support system will assist governmental authorities in proposing appropriate long-term water policies for the preservation of groundwater resources, such as for supplying potable water and/or mitigating pollution risks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000358948100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B68%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bgroundwater%2Bmodeling%2Band%2Bbiological%2Bindicators%2Bfor%2Bidentifying%2Briver%252Faquifer%2Bexchanges%26rft.aufirst%3DDidier%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DGraillot%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1186%252F2193-1801-3-68%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2193-1801%26rft.jtitle%3DSPRINGERPLUS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSPRINGERPLUS%26rft.volume%3D3%26rft.au%3DGraillot%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DParan%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DCadilhac%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=SPRINGERPLUS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1186/2193-1801-3-68,"Groundwater,Hydrological modeling,Aquatic vegetation,Aquatic invertebrates,Hyporheic zone","FORMER RIVER CHANNELS,INTERSTITIAL FAUNA,AQUATIC VEGETATION,SURFACE-WATER,RHONE RIVER,COMMUNITIES,FRANCE,FLOODPLAIN,WETLANDS,EUTROPHICATION",,"Ecole Natl Super Mines, CNRS, UMR Environm Ville & Soc 5600, 158 Cours Fauriel, F-42023 St Etienne 2, France"
39,39,"Rehg, KJ",Feb 15 2005 ,Effects of suspended sediment characteristics and bed sediment transport on streambed clogging,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Fine sediment deposition in streambeds can reduce pore water fluxes and the overall rate of hyporbeic exchange, producing deleterious effects on benthic and hyporheic ecological communities. To increase understanding of the factors that control the reduction of hyporheic exchange by fine sediment deposition, we conducted experiments in a laboratory flume to observe changes in the rates of solute exchange and kaolinite clay deposition as substantial amounts of kaolinite accumulated in the streambed. Two long-term experiments were conducted, with durations of 14 days and 29 days. Use of a laboratory flume system allowed steady stream flow conditions to be maintained throughout both experiments, and alternating injections of known quantities of kaolinite and a sodium chloride tracer were used to assess the effect of clay accumulation on hyporheic exchange directly. In the first experiment, there was no bed sediment transport and kaolinite deposition formed a highly clogged near-surface layer that greatly reduced hyporheic exchange. Application of a fundamental model for advective hyporheic exchange indicated that the effective permeability and porosity of the streambed decreased substantially during the course of the experiment. In the second experiment, the kaolinite was prepared with different surface properties to be more mobile, and the experiment was conducted with a small degree of bed sediment transport. As a result, no distinct clogged layer developed, and the rate of hyporheic exchange was found to remain approximately constant throughout the experiment (29 days). These results indicate that increasing fine sediment loads, e.g. those that occur from changes in land use, can have substantially different impacts on hyporheic exchange and associated ecological processes depending on the stream flow conditions, the rate and frequency of bed sediment transport, and the extent of interaction of the introduced fines with bed sediments.

40,40,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",Jan 2014 ,Assessing invertebrate assemblages in the subsurface zone of stream sediments ( 0-15 cm deep) using a hyporheic sampler,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Quantitative comparisons between benthic and hyporheic invertebrate communities are crucial for understanding the biological functions of the hyporheic zone, such as storage, migrations, and exchanges of invertebrates with the surface stream. Such comparisons are still hampered by the use of different techniques adapted to each habitat (benthic versus hyporheic). This work combines two different techniques for sampling the upper layers of bed sediments (0-15 cm): the semiquantitative Bou-Rouch pump classically used to sample the hyporheic zone (>15 cm), and the quantitative Hess sampler commonly used to sample the benthic zone (15 cm), in order to evaluate the quantitative efficiency of the pump in this 0-15 cm zone. First, a Bou-Rouch sample (BR) was taken within the cylinder of a Hess inserted within the streambed, then a second sample (benthic complement, BC) was collected within the Hess after removing the pump, in order to catch all invertebrates not extracted with the pump. The BR samples collected on average 14.5% of the total abundance and about 50% of the actual richness. The large range of variation indicates that the combination of the two techniques is not valid for a quantitative evaluation of benthic communities. Contrary to expectations, the pump did not collect more interstitial and groundwater invertebrates and no differences in faunal composition between upstream and downstream riffle positions were observed. Our results do not question the use of the BR technique under standard conditions i.e., when sampling the hyporheic zone, but underline how it is crucial to know its quantitative limits.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000331798800031,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAssessing%2Binvertebrate%2Bassemblages%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bsubsurface%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bsediments%2B%2528%2B0-15%2Bcm%2Bdeep%2529%2Busing%2Ba%2Bhyporheic%2Bsampler%26rft.aufirst%3DMarie-Jose%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DDole-Olivier%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2012WR013207%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D465%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D453-465%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D453%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DDole-Olivier%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DMaazouzi%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2012WR013207,"hyporheic zone,benthic zone,invertebrates,Bou-Rouch pump,abundance,richness","BOU-ROUCH METHOD,INTERSTITIAL COMMUNITIES,VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION,RHONE RIVER,RESPONSES,PATTERNS,RIFFLES,FAUNA,MACROINVERTEBRATES,INTERMITTENT",,"Univ Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, LEHNA, CNRS,UMR 5023, 43 Blvd 11 Novembre 1918, FR-69622 Villeurbanne, France"
41,41,"Gooseff, MN",Sep-dec 2004 ,Reach-scale cation exchange controls on major ion chemistry of an Antarctic glacial meltwater stream,AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY,"The McMurdo dry valleys of Antarctica represent the largest of the ice-free areas on the Antarctic continent, containing glaciers, meltwater streams, and closed basin lakes. Previous geochemical studies of dry valley streams and lakes have addressed chemical weathering reactions of hyporheic substrate and geochemical evolution of dry valley surface waters. We examine cation transport and exchange reactions during a stream tracer experiment in a dry valley glacial meltwater stream. The injection solution was composed of dissolved Li+, Na+, K+, and Cl-. Chloride behaved conservatively in this stream, but Li+, Na+, and K+ were reactive to varying degrees. Mass balance analysis indicates that relative to Cl-, Li+ and K+ were taken up in downstream transport and Na+ was released. Simulations of conservative and reactive (first-order uptake or generation) solute transport were made with the OTIS (one-dimensional solute transport with inflow and storage) model. Among the four experimental reaches of Green Creek, solute transport simulations reveal that Li+ was removed from stream water in all four reaches, K+ was released in two reaches, taken up in one reach, and Na+ was released in all four reaches. Hyporheic sediments appear to be variable with uptake of Li+ in two reaches, uptake of K+ in one reach, release of K+ in two reaches, and uptake of Na+ in one reach. Mass balances of the conservative and reactive simulations show that from 1.05 to 2.19 moles of Li+ was adsorbed per reach, but less than 0.3 moles of K+ and less than 0.9 moles of Na+ were released per reach. This suggests that either ( 1) exchange of another ion which was not analyzed in this experiment or ( 2) that both ion exchange and sorption control inorganic solute transport. The elevated cation concentrations introduced during the experiment are typical of initial flows in each flow season, which flush accumulated dry salts from the streambed. We propose that the bed sediments ( which compose the hyporheic zone) modulate the flushing of these salts during initial flows each season, due to ion exchange and sorption reactions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000224910300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DReach-scale%2Bcation%2Bexchange%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bmajor%2Bion%2Bchemistry%2Bof%2Ban%2BAntarctic%2Bglacial%2Bmeltwater%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DMN%26rft.auinit%3DMN%26rft.aulast%3DGooseff%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10498-004-2260-4%26rft.epage%3D238%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1380-6165%26rft.issue%3D3-4%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D221-238%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D221%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BGEOCHEM%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DMcknight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DRunkel%252C%2BRL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+GEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10498-004-2260-4,"ion exchange,major ion chemistry,McMurdo dry valleys,reactive solute transport,stream tracer experiment","MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,WATER CHEMISTRY,TAYLOR VALLEY,VICTORIA LAND,POLAR DESERT,SEDIMENT,FRYXELL,MODEL",,"Utah State Univ, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA"

43,43,"Hester, ET",Dec 2021 ,Hyporheic transverse mixing zones and dispersivity: Laboratory and numerical experiments of hydraulic controls,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,"Mixing of surface water and groundwater in shallow sediments is important to biogeochemical cycling and contaminant migration, and is often used to define the hyporheic zone. Yet knowledge of mixing processes in hyporheic zones is supported by surprisingly few rigorous lab or field observations, and differ from those in deeper groundwater by presence of enhanced head gradients, sediment heterogeneity, and temporal fluctuations. In a laboratory sediment (sand) tank we photographed a conservative dye to analyze transverse mixing zones between upwelling groundwater and bidirectional hyporheic exchange flows. We then conducted numerical modeling to investigate processes behind observed phenomena and estimate dispersivities. We found that transverse mixing zones were thin (i.e. mixing thickness measured in direction of steepest concentration gradient, delta, less than 5 cm), consistent with a small calibrated transverse dispersivity (similar to 0.1 mm) and prior lab studies conducted at similar scales. In steady-state experiments and simulations, delta and estimated dispersion coefficients increased with the surface water head drop driving exchange flows. Given relatively constant deeper groundwater heads, increased Delta h led to increased mixing zone length for both steady-state and transient conditions, indicating larger bedforms or weaker gaining conditions enhance subsurface mixing. However, Peclet number and flux-related dilution index simultaneously increased and decreased, respectively, indicating that enhancement of subsurface advection outpaced that of dispersion. In transient experiments and simulations, delta was greater than for steady-state, probably from temporary addition of longitudinal dispersion. During transient experiments, delta exhibited temporal noise, perhaps due to the mixing zone moving past varying patterns of sediment packing. Our results provide basic knowledge of mixing zone behavior in hyporheic zones with implications for hyporheic zone definitions, solute transport, mixing-dependent reaction, and water quality.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000702835000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B103885%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Btransverse%2Bmixing%2Bzones%2Band%2Bdispersivity%253A%2BLaboratory%2Band%2Bnumerical%2Bexperiments%2Bof%2Bhydraulic%2Bcontrols%26rft.aufirst%3DErich%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jconhyd.2021.103885%26rft.eissn%3D1873-6009%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0169-7722%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BCONTAMINANT%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BCONTAM%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D243%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DSantizo%252C%2BKY%26rft.au%3DWiddowson%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+CONTAMINANT+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jconhyd.2021.103885,"Hyporheic zone,Hyporheic exchange,Dispersion,Mixing-dependent reactions,Mixing-controlled reactions","IN-STREAM STRUCTURES,POROUS-MEDIA,PERMEABLE SEDIMENTS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,CHEMICAL-REACTIONS,INSET FLOODPLAINS,FLOW CONDITIONS,EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER,DENITRIFICATION",,"Virginia Tech, Charles E Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 200 Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
44,44,"Venditti, JG",Oct 1 2020 ,Struggles with stream power: Connecting theory across scales,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Two empirically consistent explanations exist for the morphology and dynamics of bedrock rivers. The stream power law appears to explain rates of rock incision at large scale (large drainage basins or landscape scale), but appears to be of limited value in predicting reach-scale morphology and dynamics. The underlying reason why stream power is such an effective tool for understanding landscape evolution is because it is an explicit representation of the inverse power relation between slope and area in rivers incising bedrock. This morphometric relation is nearly universal, subject to exogenous contingencies. Independent testing and validation of the stream power incision model is challenging because of the contingencies that exist in almost all landscapes. Mechanistic models of erosion have been tested and validated at small scales, generally below the reach scale, and opportunities exist for independent testing and validation by using them to predict reach-scale morphologies. Predicting larger scale bedrock river morphology requires the assumption that flow, sediment fluxes and bedrock erosion processes that occur at smaller scale are adequately averaged at larger scales, which is not well supported. Reconciling these two scales of explanation is one of the grand challenges of fluvial geomorphology, unless we accept that theory and explanations will be scale-delimited.

In addition, there is recent concern regarding the role of hyporheic flow on the contamination of rivers following oil spills. To better understand hyporheic flow paths and velocities, it is important to measure hyporheic flow at high spatial and temporal resolution. A practical method to measure hyporheic flow in a laboratory flume based on dye injection, digital images, and moment analysis was developed. An experiment conducted using a single gravel bar demonstrated good agreement between observations and estimates based on image processing. The measured hyporheic flow field showed upstream and downstream flow that discharged downstream of the bar top, the presence of a flow divide and flow stagnation, and hyporheic flow velocities indicative of turbulent flow for which Darcy's law is not applicable.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000466874200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Blaboratory%2Bmethod%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bvisualization%2Band%2Bquantification%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bpaths%2Band%2Bvelocities%26rft.aufirst%3DChristopher%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DFruetel%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252Fcjce-2018-0131%26rft.eissn%3D1208-6029%26rft.epage%3D457%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0315-1468%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BCIVIL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D448-457%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D448%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BCIVIL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DFruetel%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DMumford%252C%2BKG%26rft.au%3DBascom%252C%2BKS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+CIVIL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1139/cjce-2018-0131,"rivers,hyporheic flow,laboratory flume,gravel bar,image analysis","CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,EXCHANGE,ZONE,BED",,"Queens Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 58 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada"
46,46,"Grant, SB",Oct 7 2014 ,First-Order Contaminant Removal in the Hyporheic Zone of Streams: Physical Insights from a Simple Analytical Model,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"A simple analytical model is presented for the removal of stream-borne contaminants by hyporheic exchange across duned or rippled streambeds. The model assumes a steady-state balance between contaminant supply from the stream and first-order reaction in the sediment. Hyporheic exchange occurs by bed form pumping, in which water and contaminants flow into bed forms in high-pressure regions (downwelling zones) and out of bed forms in low-pressure regions (upwelling zones). Model-predicted contaminant concentrations are higher in downwelling zones than upwelling zones, reflecting the strong coupling that exists between transport and reaction in these systems. When flow-averaged, the concentration difference across upwelling and downwelling zones drives a net contaminant flux into the sediment bed proportional to the average downwelling velocity. The downwelling velocity is functionally equivalent to a mass transfer coefficient, and can be estimated from stream state variables including stream velocity, bed form geometry, and the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the sediment. Increasing the mass transfer coefficient increases the fraction of streamwater cycling through the hyporheic zone (per unit length of stream) but also decreases the time contaminants undergo first-order reaction in the sediment. As a consequence, small changes in stream state variables can significantly alter the performance of hyporheic zone treatment systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000343016600045,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFirst-Order%2BContaminant%2BRemoval%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bof%2BStreams%253A%2BPhysical%2BInsights%2Bfrom%2Ba%2BSimple%2BAnalytical%2BModel%26rft.aufirst%3DStanley%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DGrant%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes501694k%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D11378%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D11369-11378%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D11369%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DGrant%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DStolzenbach%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DBardini%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es501694k,,"BOUNDARIES INTERFACIAL FLUX,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSPORT,DENITRIFICATION,REHABILITATION,RESTORATION",,"Univ Calif Irvine, Henry Samueli Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA"
47,47,"Ward, AS",Feb 2016 ,Hydrogeomorphic controls on hyporheic and riparian transport in two headwater mountain streams during base flow recession,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Solute transport along riparian and hyporheic flow paths is broadly expected to respond to dynamic hydrologic forcing by streams, aquifers, and hillslopes. However, direct observation of these dynamic responses is lacking, as is the relative control of geologic setting as a control on responses to dynamic hydrologic forcing. We conducted a series of four stream solute tracer injections through base flow recession in each of two watersheds with contrasting valley morphology in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, monitoring tracer concentrations in the stream and in a network of shallow riparian wells in each watershed. We found hyporheic mean arrival time, temporal variance, and fraction of stream water in the bedrock-constrained valley bottom and near large roughness elements in the wider valley bottom were not variable with discharge, suggesting minimal control by hydrologic forcing. Conversely, we observed increases in mean arrival time and temporal variance and decreasing fraction stream water with decreasing discharge near the hillslopes in the wider valley bottom. This may indicate changes in stream discharge and valley bottom hydrology control transport in less constrained locations. We detail five hydrogeomorphic responses to base flow recession to explain observed spatial and temporal patterns in the interactions between streams and their valley bottoms. Models able to account for the transition from geologically dominated processes in the near-stream subsurface to hydrologically dominated processes near the hillslope will be required to predict solute transport and fate in valley bottoms of headwater mountain streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000373117300049,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrogeomorphic%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Band%2Briparian%2Btransport%2Bin%2Btwo%2Bheadwater%2Bmountain%2Bstreams%2Bduring%2Bbase%2Bflow%2Brecession%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR018225%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1497%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1479-1497%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1479%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DSchmadel%252C%2BNM%26rft.au%3DSingha%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015WR018225,"solute transport,solute tracer,riparian hydrology,time-variable transit time distribution,hyporheic","AMBIENT GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,ZONE,SURFACE,CATCHMENTS,DYNAMICS,MODELS,OREGON",,"Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA"
48,48,"Huizenga, A",Apr 2017 ,Stream-aquifer and in-stream processes affecting nitrogen along a major river and contributing tributary,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,"This study assesses the spatio-temporal patterns of water and nutrient mass exchange in a stream-riparian system of a major river and a contributing tributary in an irrigated semi-arid region. Field monitoring is performed along reaches of the Arkansas River (4.7 km) and Timpas Creek (2.0 km) in southeastern Colorado during the 2014 growing season, with water quantity and water quality data collected using a network of in-stream sampling sites and groundwater monitoring wells. Mass balance approaches were used to identify temporal and spatial trends in flow, nitrogen (N), and salinity in stream-aquifer exchange. In the Arkansas River, percent decrease of N concentration along the study reach averaged 36% over the period, with results from a stochastic mass balance simulation indicating a 90% probability that 44% to 50% of NO3-N mass in the study reach (109-124 kg/day/km) was removed by in-stream processes between 1 September and 8 November. Results suggest that contact with organic-rich river bed sediments has a strong impact on N removal. A greater decrease in concentrations of NO3-N along the reach during the low flow period suggests the effect of both in-stream processes and dilution by inflowing groundwater that undergoes denitrification as it flows through the riparian and hyporheic zones into the river. In contrast, N concentration decreases in the smaller Timpas Creek were negligible. Results for the Arkansas River also are in contrast with other large agriculturally-influenced rivers, which have not exhibited capacity to remove N at significant rates. Results provide important insights across spatial and temporal scales and point to the need for investigating nutrient dynamics in large streams draining agriculturally-dominated watersheds.

49,49,"Stern, N",Aug 2017 ,"Colonization Habitat Controls Biomass, Composition, and Metabolic Activity of Attached Microbial Communities in the Columbia River Hyporheic Corridor",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Hydrologic exchange plays a critical role in biogeochemical cycling within the hyporheic zone (the interface between river water and groundwater) of riverine ecosystems. Such exchange may set limits on the rates of microbial metabolism and impose deterministic selection on microbial communities that adapt to dynamically changing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources. This study examined the response of attached microbial communities (in situ colonized sand packs) from groundwater, hyporheic, and riverbed habitats within the Columbia River hyporheic corridor to ""cross-feeding"" with either groundwater, river water, or DOC-free artificial fluids. Our working hypothesis was that deterministic selection during in situ colonization would dictate the response to cross-feeding, with communities displaying maximal biomass and respiration when supplied with their native fluid source. In contrast to expectations, the major observation was that the riverbed colonized sand had much higher biomass and respiratory activity, as well as a distinct community structure, compared with those of the hyporheic and groundwater colonized sands. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed a much higher proportion of certain heterotrophic taxa as well as significant numbers of eukaryotic algal chloroplasts in the riverbed colonized sand. Significant quantities of DOC were released from riverbed sediment and colonized sand, and separate experiments showed that the released DOC stimulated respiration in the groundwater and piezometer colonized sand. These results suggest that the accumulation and degradation of labile particulate organic carbon (POC) within the riverbed are likely to release DOC, which may enter the hyporheic corridor during hydrologic exchange, thereby stimulating microbial activity and imposing deterministic selective pressure on the microbial community composition.IMPORTANCE The influence of river water-groundwater mixing on hyporheic zone microbial community structure and function is an important but poorly understood component of riverine biogeochemistry. This study employed an experimental approach to gain insight into how such mixing might be expected to influence the biomass, respiration, and composition of hyporheic zone microbial communities. Colonized sands from three different habitats (groundwater, river water, and hyporheic) were "" cross-fed"" with either groundwater, river water, or DOC-free artificial fluids. We expected that the colonization history would dictate the response to cross-feeding, with communities displaying maximal biomass and respiration when supplied with their native fluid source. By contrast, the major observation was that the riverbed communities had much higher biomass and respiration, as well as a distinct community structure compared with those of the hyporheic and groundwater colonized sands. These results highlight the importance of riverbed microbial metabolism in organic carbon processing in hyporheic corridors.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000406877500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be00260-17%26rft.atitle%3DColonization%2BHabitat%2BControls%2BBiomass%252C%2BComposition%252C%2Band%2BMetabolic%2BActivity%2Bof%2BAttached%2BMicrobial%2BCommunities%2Bin%2Bthe%2BColumbia%2BRiver%2BHyporheic%2BCorridor%26rft.aufirst%3DNoah%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DStern%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1128%252FAEM.00260-17%26rft.eissn%3D1098-5336%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0099-2240%26rft.issue%3D16%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BAND%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BMICROBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BENVIRON%2BMICROB%26rft.volume%3D83%26rft.au%3DStern%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DGinder-Vogel%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DRoden%252C%2BEE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39vUy74Y9nfvfg8aiKYkH&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+AND+ENVIRONMENTAL+MICROBIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1128/AEM.00260-17,"16S rRNA gene,biogeochemistry,biomass,composition,deterministic selection,dissolved organic carbon,hyporheic corridor,microbial communities,respiration,riverine","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SURFACE-WATER,ASSEMBLY PROCESSES,SEASONAL DYNAMICS,ZONE,MOBILIZATION,GROUNDWATER,SOIL,SEDIMENT,FLOW",,"Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geosci, Madison, WI 53706 USA"
