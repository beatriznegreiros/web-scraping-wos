0,0,"Brunke, M",Sep 1999 ,Hyporheic bacteria - relationships to environmental gradients and invertebrates in a prealpine stream,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Bacterial abundance and production in hyporheic interstices of the Toss River, a gravel-bed stream in Switzerland, were examined focusing on spatial distribution patterns in relationship to potential resources and meio- and macrofaunal consumers. The subsurface flow regime at the study site was characterized by a cross sectional hydraulic gradient, with ground water exfiltration at the left margin and surface water infiltration at the right margin; in midstream, horizontal advection along the channel flow prevailed. Measurement of biotic and abiotic parameters were performed down to sediment depths of 150 cm within each hydrological exchange type.Bacterial abundances ranged between 1.6 x 10(5) to 4.8 x 10(8) cells/ml interstitial volume containing water and fine particles and differed significantly between upper and deeper sediment strata. This change with depth was significantly modulated by the type of hydrological exchange. The bacterial carbon portion of total POC varied between 0.06 % and 5.3 % and tended to decrease with depth. Bacteria were most numerous at sediment depths where inflow of stream water occurred, but had been attenuated. Bacterial production was highest in hyporheic interstices dominated by surface water inflow. Bacterial abundance and production were strongly correlated to interstitial particulate organic matter; the best predictor for both was the content of particulate nitrogen, explaining 75 % and 72 % of the variation, respectively. Inclusion of hyporheic positions, defined by sediment depth and hydrological exchange type, improved the explanatory power of models to 88 % and 84 %, respectively. Hyporheic positions provide information on flowpath connections, which were particularly relevant when one uses dissolved organic carbon and interstitial fine sediment as explanatory variables.Abundance of several hyporheic invertebrate taxa, taxa richness and total invertebrate density were positively correlated to bacterial abundance and production. The hyporheic fauna exhibited a gradient between interstitial positions influenced by surface water and those dominated by phreatic ground water. The coupling of sediment depth and hydrological exchange type revealed flowpath connections as being superimposed vectors in determining hyporheic abiotic and biotic gradients.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000083547200003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bbacteria%2B-%2Brelationships%2Bto%2Benvironmental%2Bgradients%2Band%2Binvertebrates%2Bin%2Ba%2Bprealpine%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DM%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DBrunke%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft.epage%3D217%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D189-217%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D189%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D146%26rft.au%3DBrunke%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DFischer%252C%2BH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,FREE AMINO-ACIDS,SEDIMENT BACTERIA,BED SEDIMENTS,MICROSCOPIC ENUMERATION,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,BLACKWATER RIVER,MARINE-BACTERIA,RHONE RIVER,FOOD-WEB",,"Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Limnol Lowland Rivers & Shallow Lakes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany"
1,1,"Jiang, QH",Oct 2021 ,N2O Production and Consumption Processes in a Salinity-Impacted Hyporheic Zone,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Hyporheic zone plays a key role in the release of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) to the stream water, and the variable-density flow induced by salinity from stream water can increase the hyporheic exchange flux. However, the nitrogen dynamics in a salinity-impacted hyporheic zone under different saltwater concentrations still remain unclear. In this study, a numerical model coupling the hyporheic flow, salt transport and nitrogen transformations is proposed to investigate how density gradients affect the N2O production and consumption processes in the streambed. The results show that density gradients between infiltrating saltwater and ambient groundwater create gravitational instabilities that significantly accelerate the downward flow of pore water. Such density gradients enhance the species (e.g., dissolved organic carbon and NO3-) mixing efficiency and increase the reaction area, leading to the formation of N2O fingers and promoting the N2O production-consumption rate. The variable-density flow also drags more reactants infiltrating deeper area with longer residence times and increase the frequency of the Damkohler number Da > 1 in the streambed, facilitating the conversion of NO3- to the final product N-2 through stepwise denitrification processes. Therefore, the NO3- removal efficiency and N2O yield are increased by 24% and reduced by 3% at low-density gradients (Delta rho/rho(f) = 7 x 10(-4)), respectively. The possible implications and applications about the effects of hydrodynamic changes due to the density effect are also presented. However, further biogeochemical experiments and river restoration strategies are needed to validate the results of this study.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000711969900031,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021JG006512%26rft.atitle%3DN2O%2BProduction%2Band%2BConsumption%2BProcesses%2Bin%2Ba%2BSalinity-Impacted%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DQihao%26rft.auinit%3DQH%26rft.aulast%3DJiang%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021JG006512%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D126%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BQH%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BYL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021JG006512,"N2O production-consumption,hyporheic exchange,saltwater,density effect,incomplete denitrification,complete denitrification","NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS,WATER SALINIZATION SYNDROME,FRESH-WATER,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,SPATIAL-PATTERNS,NITRATE REMOVAL,NUTRIENT-UPTAKE,RIVER,DENITRIFICATION,GROUNDWATER",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Peoples R China"
2,2,"Yan, AL",Mar 2018 ,Effect of ion exchange on the rate of aerobic microbial oxidation of ammonium in hyporheic zone sediments,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Microbially mediated ammonium oxidation is a major process affecting nitrogen transformation and cycling in natural environments. This study investigated whether ion exchange process can affect microbially mediated aerobic oxidation of ammonium in a hyporheic zone (HZ) sediments from the Columbia River at US Department of Energy's Hanford site, Washington State. Experiments were conducted using synthetic groundwater and river water to investigate their effect on ammonium oxidation. Results indicated that ammonium sorption through ion exchange reactions decreased the rate of ammonium oxidation, apparently resulting from the influence of the ion exchange on dissolved ammonium concentration, thus decreasing the bioavailability of ammonium for microbial oxidation. However, with the decrease in dissolved ammonium concentration, the sorbed ammonium released back to aqueous phase, and became bioavailable so that all the ammonium in the suspensions were oxidized. Our results implied a dynamic change in ammonium oxidation rates in an environment such as at HZ where river water and groundwater with different chemical compositions exchange frequently that can affect ammonium sorption and desorption through ion exchange reactions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000427592100068,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Bion%2Bexchange%2Bon%2Bthe%2Brate%2Bof%2Baerobic%2Bmicrobial%2Boxidation%2Bof%2Bammonium%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bsediments%26rft.aufirst%3DAilan%26rft.auinit%3DAL%26rft.aulast%3DYan%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-018-1217-x%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D8887%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D8880-8887%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D8880%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DYan%252C%2BAL%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BCX%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11356-018-1217-x,"Hyporheic zone,Nitrogen cycling,Ammonium oxidation,Ammoniumsorption,Ion exchange","CATION-EXCHANGE,HANFORD SITE,SUBSURFACE SEDIMENTS,CONTAMINATED GROUNDWATER,NITROGEN,DENITRIFICATION,DESORPTION,TRANSPORT,KINETICS,WATER",,"Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China"
3,3,"Acuna, V",Feb 2009 ,Surface-subsurface water exchange rates along alluvial river reaches control the thermal patterns in an Alpine river network,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Water temperature is a key characteristic of stream ecosystems that is gaining scientific and managerial relevance as maximum temperatures in aquatic ecosystems increase worldwide.2. To assess the effect of surface-subsurface water exchange on stream water temperature patterns, four alluvial reaches in the Tagliamento River basin (NE Italy), constrained by geomorphic knickpoints at the upper and lower end, and two to four hyporheic flowpaths within each reach, were continuously studied during summer 2007 and winter 2007-08. Water temperature was continuously monitored at the upstream and downstream knickpoints of the floodplains, as well as at discrete upwelling areas within each reach. Discharge and vertical hydraulic gradient were measured along the alluvial reaches, and the residence time and chemistry of upwelling water were assessed four times during the study.3. Discharge variation along the study reaches revealed that massive hyporheic exchange occurred in all sites, ranging from 21% in reach 2-52% in reach 1. End member mixing analysis showed little influence of ground water, as almost all upwelling water was freshly infiltrated hyporheic water. Importantly, hyporheic exchange flows shaped surface temperature at the upwelling locations in all study reaches, providing potential thermal refugia for aquatic biota. At sites with highest hyporheic flow rates, net temperature change was also reflected at the floodplain scale.4. The magnitude of the thermal change along a hyporheic flowpath was not related to the flowpath length but to the estimated Rn-222 water age. Reduction in the diel thermal amplitude by hyporheic flows rather than net temperature change, reduced temperature extremes. Therefore, restoration activities to create thermal refugia should consider the role of hyporheic flows and enhance the exchange between surface and hyporheic waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000262470300007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSurface-subsurface%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Brates%2Balong%2Balluvial%2Briver%2Breaches%2Bcontrol%2Bthe%2Bthermal%2Bpatterns%2Bin%2Ban%2BAlpine%2Briver%2Bnetwork%26rft.aufirst%3DV.%26rft.auinit%3DV%26rft.aulast%3DAcuna%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2008.02109.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D320%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D306-320%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D306%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DAcuna%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DTockner%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02109.x,"floodplain ecology,global warming,hyporheic zone,thermal refugia,water temperature","TAGLIAMENTO RIVER,STREAMBED TOPOGRAPHY,TEMPERATURE BEHAVIOR,HYPORHEIC ZONE,BROWN TROUT,FLOW PATHS,LAND-USE,ECOSYSTEM,HABITAT,OREGON",,"Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland"
4,4,"Shi, WQ",Mar 10 2020 ,Dynamics of heat transport across sediment deposited hyporheic zone inside reservoirs following hydropower production,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Heat transport through hyporheic zones is critical for many temperature-sensitive biogeochemical processes and survival of aquatic organisms. Water storing and releasing in the reservoir are often made to modify hydropower production, which may cause hydrological variation and alter heat transport regime across the hyporheic zone inside the reservoir. In this study, we investigated heat transport across the hyporheic zone within a sediment deposited bar inside a hydropower reservoir on the mainstream of the upper Mekong River. Hydrothermal dynamics in the hyporheic zone following hydropower production were analyzed by monitoring changes of water level and temperature using automatic monitoring wells. Results showed that hydropower production induced water level fluctuations, enhanced hyporheic exchanges and thereby accelerated heat transport across the bar. The hyporheic zone was a heat source for the reservoir water regardless of the time of the year. In summer, heat transport from the bar hyporheic zone to the reservoir was strong (0.50 x 10(8)-10.28 x 10(8) J m(-1) d(-1)) and mainly occurred through near-surface sediment layer (0-0.5 m), which was attributed to active hyporheic exchanges and strong solar radiation. In winter, heat transport was weak (0.01 x 10(8)-1.01 x 10(8) J m(-1) d(-1)) and mainly occurred in sediment bottom layer (<1.0m) with limited energy inputs from microbial activities. This study adds to our understanding of hydrothermal dynamics in hyporheic zones under flow regulations by dams. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

5,5,"Wang, XY",Oct 2018 ,Beaver Dams Induce Hyporheic and Biogeochemical Changes in Riparian Areas in a Mountain Peatland,WETLANDS,"Hyporheic exchange is important in increasing stream water transit time through basins and enhancing redox-sensitive biogeochemical reactions influencing downstream water quality. Such exchange may be enhanced by beaver dams which are common throughout low order streams including those originating in peatlands. To understand the influence of beaver dams on hyporheic flows and biogeochemical properties, nitrogen (N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC) and N cycling rates were observed along a beaver dammed, third-order stream draining Canadian Rocky Mountain peatland. Beaver dams enlarged the hyporheric zone from 1.5 to 7.5m. The looping hyporheic flow path created a zone of N and DOC depletion adjacent to the dams. As a result, nitrification rates were lowest in this zone. Where hyporheic flows exited the riparian area and flowed back to the stream channel downstream of a dam, the adjacent riparian area served as a source of N and DOC to the stream. Enhanced nutrient influx to streams owing to beaver dam modified hyporheic flow paths has implications for stream biogeochemical cycling and ecological integrity, which need further exploration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000450305300014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBeaver%2BDams%2BInduce%2BHyporheic%2Band%2BBiogeochemical%2BChanges%2Bin%2BRiparian%2BAreas%2Bin%2Ba%2BMountain%2BPeatland%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaoyue%26rft.auinit%3DXY%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs13157-018-1059-9%26rft.eissn%3D1943-6246%26rft.epage%3D1032%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0277-5212%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWETLANDS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1017-1032%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1017%26rft.stitle%3DWETLANDS%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DShaw%252C%2BEL%26rft.au%3DBedard-Haughn%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WETLANDS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s13157-018-1059-9,"Hyporheic exchange,Nitrogen mineralization,Nitrogen dynamics,Peatlands,Riparian,Nutrient flushing","WATER EXCHANGE,ZONE HYDROLOGY,HOT MOMENTS,STREAM,DENITRIFICATION,DYNAMICS,EMISSIONS,MINERALIZATION,TERRESTRIAL,ECOSYSTEMS",,"Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Soil Sci, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada"
6,6,"Saccardi, B",Dec 2021 ,"Improving Predictions of Stream CO2 Concentrations and Fluxes Using a Stream Network Model: A Case Study in the East River Watershed, CO, USA",GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,"Inland waters are an important component of the global carbon budget. However, our ability to predict carbon fluxes from stream systems remains uncertain, as pCO(2) varies within streams at scales of 1-100 m. This makes direct monitoring of large-scale CO2 fluxes impractical. We incorporate CO2 input and output fluxes into a stream network advection-reaction model, representing the first process-based representation of stream CO2 dynamics at watershed scales. This model includes groundwater (GW) CO2 inputs, water column (WC), benthic hyporheic zone (BHZ) respiration, downstream advection, and atmospheric exchange. We evaluate this model against existing statistical methods including upscaling and multiple linear regressions through comparisons to high-resolution stream pCO(2) data collected across the East River Watershed in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA). The stream network model accurately captures GW, evasion, and respiration-driven pCO(2) variability and significantly outperforms multiple linear regressions for predicting pCO(2). Further, the model provides estimates of CO2 contributions from internal versus external sources suggesting that streams transition from GW- to BHZ-dominated sources between 3rd and 4th Strahler orders, with GW, BHZ, and WC accounting for 49.3%, 50.6%, and 0.1% of CO2 fluxes from the watershed, respectively. Lastly, stream network model atmospheric CO2 fluxes are 4-12x times smaller than upscaling technique predictions, largely due to relationships between stream pCO(2) and gas exchange velocities. Taken together, this stream network model improves our ability to predict stream CO2 dynamics and efflux. Furthermore, future applications to regional and global scales may result in a significant downward revision of global flux estimates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000735888800011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021GB006972%26rft.atitle%3DImproving%2BPredictions%2Bof%2BStream%2BCO2%2BConcentrations%2Band%2BFluxes%2BUsing%2Ba%2BStream%2BNetwork%2BModel%253A%2BA%2BCase%2BStudy%2Bin%2Bthe%2BEast%2BRiver%2BWatershed%252C%2BCO%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DBrian%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DSaccardi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021GB006972%26rft.eissn%3D1944-9224%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0886-6236%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEMICAL%2BCYCLES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEM%2BCY%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DSaccardi%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DWinnick%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=GLOBAL+BIOGEOCHEMICAL+CYCLES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021GB006972,"stream carbon,stream CO2,carbon cycling,stream network model,stream carbon reactive transport,river carbon cycling","GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,DIOXIDE,CH4,GROUNDWATER,TRANSPORT,DENITRIFICATION,CATCHMENT,DYNAMICS",,"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Geosci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA"

For this purpose, the samples of hyporheic water were collected from the four piezometers (IYHW1, IYHW2, IYHW3, and IYHW4) that were installed at 10 m interval across the stream. As a control group, the stream water (IYSW1) and the groundwater (IYAW1) were sampled on December 2, 2016. We also measured field parameters and analyzed chemical compositions of the hyporheic waters, stream water, and groundwater. The structure of prokaryote microbial community for high rates of Proteobacteria showed a high rate (90.5 similar to 96.8%) for all samples except IYSW1 and IYHW1. Also, Chytridiomycota in the structure of eukaryotic microbial community was predominant in IYSW1 (57.8%) and IYHW1 (43.4%) but was rarely (<0.2%) found in IYAW1 and IYHW4. As a result, it is inferred that IYSW1 and IYHW1 were dominated by stream water, and IYAW1 and IYHW4 were found to be dominated by groundwater. And IYHW2 and IYHW3 were a point zone of interaction between groundwater and stream water, where microbial and hydrological changes were dynamic.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000442119400006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bgroundwater%2Band%2Bstream%2Bwater%2Binteraction%2Busing%2Bmetagenomics%2Banalysis%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%252C%2BInje%2Bof%2BGangwon%2BProvince%26rft.aufirst%3DWoo-Hyun%26rft.auinit%3DWH%26rft.aulast%3DJeon%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.14770%252Fjgsk.2018.54.3.293%26rft.eissn%3D2288-7377%26rft.epage%3D300%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0435-4036%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BGEOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%2BOF%2BKOREA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D293-300%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D293%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOL%2BSOC%2BKOREA%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DJeon%252C%2BWH%26rft.au%3DPark%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DCho%252C%2BYJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+GEOLOGICAL+SOCIETY+OF+KOREA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.14770/jgsk.2018.54.3.293,"metagenomics,prokaryote,eukaryote,biological indicator,hyporheic zone,groundwater and stream water interaction","CLIMATE-CHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,EXCHANGE,RECHARGE,ROZELLA,FUNGI,HEAT",,"Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Geol, Chunchon 24341, South Korea"

Particle tracking showed that lateral hyporheic area (planimetric area of flow paths lateral to the stream that are recharged by and return to the stream with travel times of 10 days or less) differed between the two study streams and varied with discharge within each system. At the Rio Calaveras (welded tuff), lateral hyporheic area ranged from 1.7 to 4 m(2) over the annual cycle. In the Aspen Creek system (sandstone), lateral hyporheic area (1-1.5 m(2)) was restricted to roughly half of that observed at Rio Calaveras. The size of the hyporheic zone lateral to the streams at both sites decreased by approximately 50% during high flows. Sensitivity analyses indicated that changes in the hydraulic conductivity of alluvial and streambed sediments and variation in recharge rates have greatest impact on the magnitude, direction, and spatial distribution of stream-groundwater exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000072273000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSeasonal%2Bvariation%2Bin%2Bsurface-subsurface%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Band%2Blateral%2Bhyporheic%2Barea%2Bof%2Btwo%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DGJ%26rft.auinit%3DGJ%26rft.aulast%3DWroblicky%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F97WR03285%26rft.epage%3D328%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D317-328%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D317%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DWroblicky%252C%2BGJ%26rft.au%3DCampana%252C%2BME%26rft.au%3DDahm%252C%2BCN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/97WR03285,,"ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,LAKES",,"Jacobs Engn Grp, 2155 Louisiana NE,Suite 10000, Albuquerque, NM USA"
9,9,"Shrivastava, S",Dec 2021 ,Sediment Reworking in Streambeds With Fine Sediment Deposits and Its Influence on Hyporheic Flow Regime,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The mobilization and mixing of sediments by the activities of in-stream fauna, referred to as sediment reworking, constantly modifies the hydro-physical properties of streambeds. This sediment-organism interaction has been increasingly recognized to influence the hyporheic exchange flows in stream ecosystems, particularly in low flow environments (e.g., during base flow). In this work, we advance the knowledge of sediment reworking process by studying its impact on hyporheic exchange flows in streambeds with fine sediment deposits. Laboratory experiments are conducted in re-circulating flumes following a control (only fine sediments) and treatment- (fine sediments + organisms) based design. The experiments involve studying the interaction of model organisms (Lumbriculus variegatus) with fine sediment (clay) deposits, and its subsequent influence on hyporheic flow regime in homogenous streambeds with fine sand, coarse sand, and gravel as substrate sediments. We observe that model organisms burrowed extensively into the fine sediment layer, mixed the clay particles with underlying grains, and eventually exposed the substrate sediments in the treatment flumes. Consequently, the treatment flumes exhibited greater solute penetration depth, shorter residence times, and higher hyporheic exchange flux compared to their respective control flumes. The results also suggest that the modification of hyporheic exchange flows depends on the overall reworking of the beds that is, the interaction of organisms with both substrate material and deposited fine sediments. It is critical to comprehend the influence of streambed inhabitants on mass and energy exchange across the sediment-water interface as it has implications on the overall quality of both stream and groundwater.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000735901700035,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030360%26rft.atitle%3DSediment%2BReworking%2Bin%2BStreambeds%2BWith%2BFine%2BSediment%2BDeposits%2Band%2BIts%2BInfluence%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2BRegime%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DShrivastava%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030360%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DShrivastava%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DStewardson%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DArora%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR030360,"sediment reworking,fine sediment clogging,hyporheic exchange","HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES,ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS,RIVER,BIOTURBATION,EXCHANGE,OLIGOCHAETA,TUBIFICIDAE,ORGANISMS,TRANSPORT",,"Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Environm Hydrol & Water Resources Grp, Parkville, Vic, Australia"
10,10,"Han, BS",Mar 30 2013 ,Spatial and temporal intensification of lateral hyporheic flux in narrowing intra-meander zones,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Meander bends in alluvial rivers morphologically evolve towards meander cut-off with narrowing intra-meander necks, and this should steepen hydraulic gradients and intensify intra-meander hyporheic flux. This research used dye tracking and head loss measurements in a 1:500 planimetrically scaled laboratory river table to quantify the spatial and temporal intensification of intra-meander flux rates at two evolution ages. The younger meander bend, M1, had a sinuosity of 2.3, a river neck width of 0.39cm, and 0.6% river slope, and the older meander bend, M3, had a sinuosity of 5.2, a river neck width of 0.12cm, and 0.5% river slope. Flux into and out of the meander bend was estimated along the normalized curvilinear distance s*, with the meander neck at s*=0.1 and s*=0.9, the meander centroid at s*=0.37 and s*=0.63, and the apex at s*=0.5. Between the meander centroid and neck, we documented a 60% spatial intensification for M1 and a 90% spatial intensification for M3. Between M1 and M3, we documented a 135% temporal intensification at the neck and a 100% intensification at the centroid. Our empirical spatial and temporal intensification rates involving the M1 and the M3 scenario were one to three times lower than theoretical rates derived from a river evolution model with equivalent M1 and M3 planimetry. Overestimation by the theoretical model was attributed to exaggerated head loss caused by the model neglecting groundwater contributions to river stage. Hyporheic exchange provides critical ecosystem services, and its spatial and temporal variation with meander evolution should be considered in river management.

These daily pulses modulate fluid exchange and residence times in the hyporheic zone where biogeochemical reactions are typically pronounced. The effects of a small flood pulse under low-flow conditions on surface-water/groundwater exchange and biogeochemical processes were studied by monitoring and sampling from two dense transects of wells perpendicular to the river. The first transect recorded water levels and the second transect was used for water sample collection at three depths. Samples were collected from 12 wells every 2 h over a 24-h period which had a 16-cm flood pulse. Analyses included nutrients, carbon, major ions, and stable isotopes of water. The relatively small flood pulse did not cause significant mixing in the parafluvial zone. Under these conditions, the river and groundwater were decoupled, showed potentially minimal mixing at the interface, and did not exhibit any discernible denitrification of river-borne nitrate. The chemical patterns observed in the parafluvial zone can be explained by evaporation of groundwater with little mixing with river water. Thus, large pulses may be necessary in order for substantial hyporheic mixing and exchange to occur. The large regulated river under a low-flow and small flood pulse regime functioned mainly as a gaining river with little hydrologic connectivity beyond a narrow hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000376405400012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater%2Bflow%252C%2Bnutrient%252C%2Band%2Bstable%2Bisotope%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bparafluvial-hyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bregulated%2BLower%2BColorado%2BRiver%2B%2528Texas%252C%2BUSA%2529%2Bover%2Bthe%2Bcourse%2Bof%2Ba%2Bsmall%2Bflood%26rft.aufirst%3DAlyse%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DAC%26rft.aulast%3DBriody%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-016-1365-3%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D935%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D923-935%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D923%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DBriody%252C%2BAC%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DBennett%252C%2BPC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-016-1365-3,"Hyporheic zone,USA,Groundwater/ surface-water relations,Regulated river,Stable isotopes","WATER,DENITRIFICATION,EXCHANGE,IMPACT,TERRESTRIAL,QUALITY",,"Univ Texas Austin, Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA"
12,12,"Trevisan, D",Mar 2016 ,Coupling catchment hydrology and transient storage to model the fate of solutes during low-flow conditions of an upland river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The residence time of solutes in catchments is longer during low-flow conditions, due to the lengthening of transport routes and the decrease in transfer velocities. In rivers, transient storage depends largely on exchanges with channel storage and the hyporheic zone and reflects the capacity of the river to buffer pollutant loads before they enter the aquatic environment of final receptors. Our objective was to evaluate the fate of solutes along a typical confined river of upland catchments. First, we calculate lateral inflows using a variable-source hydrology approach. Then, water motion and quality in the river channel are predicted by combining hydrodynamics and exchanges with channel storage and the hyporheic zone. The model is mainly parametrized from literature data during baseflow conditions to mimic the fate of adsorptive and non-persistent pollutants. Residence time in surface water, channel storage and the hyporheic zone were found to be sensitive to lateral inflows from groundwater seepage. Channel storage is the main process controlling residence time in upstream conditions, where the riverbed is mainly composed of stones and bedrock. Downstream, along with the formation of sediment deposits and riffle-pool units, hyporheic exchanges also control the lag time in the transfer of solutes. By integrating physically based processes, the number of parameters is small, but the model still requires a detailed description of stream geometry and morphology. It can be used to evaluate stream restoration or catchment-river management when detailed data of stream geometry and morphology are available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

13,13,"Arntzen, EV",Oct 2006 ,"Effects of fluctuating river flow on groundwater/surface water mixing in the hyporheic zone of a regulated, large cobble bed river",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Physicochemical relationships in the boundary zone between groundwater and surface water (i.e. the hyporheic zone) are controlled by surface water hydrology and the hydrogeologic properties of the riverbed. We studied how sediment permeability and river discharge altered the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and water quality of the hyporheic zone within the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River. The Columbia River at Hanford is a large, cobble-bed river where water level fluctuates up to 2m daily because of hydropower generation. Concomitant with river stage recordings, continuous readings were made of water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen and water level of the hyporheic zone. The water level data were used to calculate VHG between the river and hyporheic zone. Sediment permeability was estimated using slug tests conducted in piezometers installed into the river bed. The response of water quality measurements and VHG to surface water fluctuations varied widely among study sites, ranging from no apparent response to covariance with river discharge. At some sites, a hysteretic relationship between river discharge and VHG was indicated by a time lag in the response of VHG to changes in river stage. The magnitude, rate of change and hysteresis of the VHG response varied the most at the least permeable location (hydraulic conductivity (K) = 2.9 x 10(-4) cms(-1)) and the least at the most permeable location (K = 8.8 x 10(-3) cms(-1)). Our study provides empirical evidence that sediment properties and river discharge both control the water quality of the hyporheic zone. Regulated rivers, like the Columbia River at Hanford, that undergo large, frequent discharge fluctuations represent an ideal environment in which to study hydrogeologic processes over relatively short time periods (i.e. days to weeks) that would require much longer periods (i.e. months to years) to evaluate in unregulated systems.

14,14,"Singh, T",Mar 2022 ,Impacts of Peak-Flow Events on Hyporheic Denitrification Potential,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Subsurface flows, particularly hyporheic exchange fluxes, driven by streambed topography, permeability, channel gradient and dynamic flow conditions provide prominent ecological services such as nitrate removal from streams and aquifers. Stream flow dynamics cause strongly nonlinear and often episodic contributions of nutrient concentrations in river-aquifer systems. Using a fully coupled transient flow and reactive transport model, we investigated the denitrification potential of hyporheic zones during peak-flow events. The effects of streambed permeability, channel gradient and bedform amplitude on the spatio-temporal distribution of nitrate and dissolved organic carbon in streambeds and the associated denitrification potential were explored. Distinct peak-flow events with different intensity, duration and hydrograph shape were selected to represent a wide range of peak-flow scenarios. Our results indicated that the specific hydrodynamic characteristics of individual flow events largely determine the average positive or negative nitrate removal capacity of hyporheic zones, however the magnitude of this capacity is controlled by geomorphological settings (i.e., channel slope, streambed permeability and bedform amplitude). Specifically, events with longer duration and higher intensity were shown to promote higher nitrate removal efficiency with higher magnitude of removal efficiency in the scenarios with higher slope and permeability values. These results are essential for better assessment of the subsurface nitrate removal capacity under the influence of flow dynamics and particularly peak-flow events in order to provide tailored solutions for effective restoration of interconnected river-aquifer systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000774742600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR031407%26rft.atitle%3DImpacts%2Bof%2BPeak-Flow%2BEvents%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BDenitrification%2BPotential%26rft.aufirst%3DTanu%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DSingh%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR031407%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DSingh%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DGupta%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DWohlmuth%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR031407,"hyporheic zones,denitrification potential,peak-flow events,groundwater-surfacewater interactions","RESIDENCE TIMES,EXCHANGE,HYDROPEAKING,ECOSYSTEMS,INTERFACES",,"Tech Univ Munich, Dept Numer Math, Garching, Germany"
15,15,"Bottacin-Busolin, A",Jun 2011 ,Evidence of distinct contaminant transport patterns in rivers using tracer tests and a multiple domain retention model,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Solute transport in rivers is controlled by surface hydrodynamics and by mass exchanges with distinct retention zones. Surface and hyporheic retention processes can be accounted for separately in solute transport models with multiple storage compartments. In the simplest two component model, short term storage can be associated to in-channel transient retention, e.g. produced by riparian vegetation or surface dead zones, and the long-term storage can be associated to hyporheic exchange. The STIR (Solute Transport In Rivers) multiple domain transport model is applied here to tracer test data from three very different Mediterranean streams with distinctive characteristics in terms of flow discharge, vegetation and substrate material. The model is used with an exponential residence time distribution (RTD) to represent surface storage processes and two distinct modeling closures are tested to simulate hyporheic retention: a second exponential RTD and a power-law distribution approximating a known solution for bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. Each stream shows distinct retention patterns characterized by different timescales of the storage time distribution. Both modeling closures lead to very good approximations of the observed breakthrough curves in the two rivers with permeable bed exposed to the flow, where hyporheic flows are expected to occur. In the one case where the occurrence of hyporheic flows is inhibited by bottom vegetation, only the two exponential RTD model is acceptable and the time scales of the two components are of the same magnitude. The significant finding of this work is the recognition of a strong signature of the river properties on tracer data and the evidence of the ability of multiple-component models to describe individual stream responses. This evidence may open a new perspective in river contamination studies, where rivers could possibly be classified based on their ability to trap and release pollutants. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

16,16,"Stonedahl, SH",Dec 15 2010 ,A multiscale model for integrating hyporheic exchange from ripples to meanders,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"It is necessary to improve our understanding of the exchange of dissolved constituents between surface and subsurface waters in river systems in order to better evaluate the fate of water-borne contaminants and nutrients and their effects on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Here we present a model that can predict hyporheic exchange at the bed-form-to-reach scale using readily measurable system characteristics. The objective of this effort was to compare subsurface flow induced at scales ranging from very small scale bed forms up to much larger planform geomorphic features such as meanders. In order to compare exchange consistently over this range of scales, we employed a spectral scaling approach as the basis for a generalized analysis of topography-induced stream-subsurface exchange. The spectral model involves a first-order approximation for local flow-boundary interactions but is fully three-dimensional and includes the lateral hyporheic zone in addition to the flow directly beneath the streambed. The primary model input parameters are stream velocity and slope, sediment permeability and porosity, and detailed measurements of the stream channel topography. The primary outputs are the distribution of water flux across the stream channel boundary, the resulting pore water flow paths, and the subsurface residence time distribution. We tested the bed-form-exchange component of the model using a highly detailed two-dimensional data set for exchange with ripples and dunes and then applied the model to a three-dimensional meandering stream in a laboratory flume. Having spatially explicit information allowed us to evaluate the contributions of both gravitational and current-driven hyporheic flow through various classes of stream channel features including ripples, dunes, bars, and meanders. The model simulations indicate that all scales of topography between ripples and meanders have a significant effect on pore water flow fields and residence time distributions. Furthermore, complex interactions across the spectrum of topographic features play an important role in controlling the net interfacial flux and spatial distribution of hyporheic exchange. For example, shallow exchange induced by current-driven interactions with small bed forms dominates the interfacial flux, but local pore water flows are modified significantly by larger-scale surface-groundwater interactions. As a result, simplified representations of the stream topography do not adequately characterize patterns and rates of hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000285476400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW12539%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmultiscale%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bintegrating%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bfrom%2Bripples%2Bto%2Bmeanders%26rft.aufirst%3DSusa%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DSH%26rft.aulast%3DStonedahl%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009WR008865%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DStonedahl%252C%2BSH%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2009WR008865,,"NONSORBING SOLUTES,WATER EXCHANGE,CHANNEL,STREAM,MORPHOLOGY,TRANSPORT,MECHANICS,CREEK,ZONE",,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"
17,17,"Magliozzi, C",Nov 30 2018 ,Toward a conceptual framework of hyporheic exchange across spatial scales,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Rivers are not isolated systems but interact continuously with groundwater from their confined headwaters to their wide lowland floodplains. In the last few decades, research on the hyporheic zone (HZ) has increased appreciation of the hydrological importance and ecological significance of connected river and groundwater systems. While recent studies have investigated hydrological, biogeochemical and ecohydrological processes in the HZ at bedform and reach scales, a comprehensive understanding of process-based interactions between factors operating at different spatial and temporal scales driving hyporheic exchange flows (HEFs) at reach scale and larger is still missing. Therefore, this review summarizes the factors and processes at catchment, valley, and reach scales that interact to control spatial and temporal variations in hyporheic exchange flows. By using a multi-scale perspective, this review connects field observations and modelling studies to identify the process driving patterns and dynamics of HEF. Finally, the influence of process interactions over multiple spatial scales is illustrated in a case study, supported by new GIS analyses, which highlights the importance of valley-scale factors to the expression of HEF at the reach scale. This conceptual framework will aid the development of approaches to interpret hyporheic exchange across scales, infer scaling relationships, and inform catchment management decisions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000452507400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DToward%2Ba%2Bconceptual%2Bframework%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bacross%2Bspatial%2Bscales%26rft.aufirst%3DChiara%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DMagliozzi%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-22-6163-2018%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D6185%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6163-6185%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6163%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DMagliozzi%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DGrabowski%252C%2BRC%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/hess-22-6163-2018,,"IN-STREAM STRUCTURES,LARGE WOODY DEBRIS,SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,TRANSIENT STORAGE,RIPARIAN VEGETATION,FINE-SEDIMENT,ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY",,"Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England"
18,18,"Harman, CJ",Sep 2016 ,How does reach-scale stream-hyporheic transport vary with discharge? Insights from rSAS analysis of sequential tracer injections in a headwater mountain stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The models of stream reach hyporheic exchange that are typically used to interpret tracer data assume steady-flow conditions and impose further assumptions about transport processes on the interpretation of the data. Here we show how rank Storage Selection (rSAS) functions can be used to extract process-agnostic information from tracer breakthrough curves about the time-varying turnover of reach storage. A sequence of seven slug injections was introduced to a small stream at base flow over the course of a diel fluctuation in stream discharge, providing breakthrough curves at discharges ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 L/s. Shifted gamma distributions, each with three parameters varying stepwise in time, were used to model the rSAS function and calibrated to reproduce each breakthrough curve with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies in excess of 0.99. Variations in the fitted parameters over time suggested that storage within the reach does not uniformly increase its turnover rate when discharge increases. Rather, changes in transit time are driven by both changes in the average rate of turnover (external variability) and changes in the relative rate that younger and older water contribute to discharge (internal variability). Specifically, at higher discharge, the turnover rate increased for the youngest part of the storage (corresponding to approximately 5 times the volume of the channel), while discharge from the older part of the storage remained steady, or declined slightly. The method is shown to be extensible as a new approach to modeling reach-scale solute transport that accounts for the time-varying, discharge-dependent turnover of reach storage.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000386977900024,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2Bdoes%2Breach-scale%2Bstream-hyporheic%2Btransport%2Bvary%2Bwith%2Bdischarge%253F%2BInsights%2Bfrom%2BrSAS%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Bsequential%2Btracer%2Binjections%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bmountain%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DCJ%26rft.aulast%3DHarman%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR018832%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7150%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7130-7150%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7130%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DHarman%252C%2BCJ%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DBall%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR018832,"Hyporheic,rSAS,transit time distribution,storage selection function,stream transport","TRANSIENT STORAGE,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,WATER,FLOW,MODELS,ZONE",,"Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA"
19,19,"Simcic, T",Jul 2007 ,Intensity of mineralization in the hyporheic zone of the prealpine river Baca (West Slovenia),HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity and oxygen consumption in the interstitial water, and in the fine (i.e. silt) and coarse (sand) sediment fractions from the hyporheic zone of the prealpine river Baca (W Slovenia) have been measured in order to estimate the intensity of potential and actual carbon mineralization through microbial communities. Hyporheic samples from the river bed (RB) and gravel bars (GB) were compared. ETS activity and oxygen consumption of all fractions from the RB did not differ significantly from those from the GB. ETS activity and oxygen consumption of biofilm attached to 1 g of the silt were higher than of that attached to the same mass of the sand. A significant correlation between ETS activity and oxygen consumption indicated that the former should be a good indicator of intensity of bioactivity in hyporheic sediments. The ratio of ETS activity to oxygen consumption (ETS/R ratio) revealed that the oxygen consumption of microorganisms is responsible for approximately 60% of the metabolic potential in the hyporheic sediments. The contributions of different fractions of sediment to the total ETS activity differed between RB and GB. The contribution of microorganisms in the interstitial water and silt was higher in GB than in the RB, but the sand fraction contributed less to potential carbon loss in GB than in the RB. Average total respiratory carbon loss per volume through the hyporheic zone was higher in the RB than in GB. The main reasons suggested are the different intensity of exchange of surface water with the hyporheic zone, and the rate of consolidation of sediments, which is primarily a function of river hydrology and geomorphology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000246612800018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIntensity%2Bof%2Bmineralization%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bprealpine%2Briver%2BBaca%2B%2528West%2BSlovenia%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DTatjana%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DSimcic%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-007-0621-x%26rft.epage%3D234%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D221-234%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D221%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D586%26rft.au%3DSimcic%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DMori%252C%2BN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-007-0621-x,"hyporheic sediments,ETS activity,oxygen consumption,ETS/R ratio","ELECTRON-TRANSPORT-SYSTEM,NORTH-TEMPERATE STREAM,OF-THE-ART,ETS ACTIVITY,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,MARINE-SEDIMENTS,ORGANIC-MATTER,RESPIRATORY ACTIVITY,BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT,MOUNTAIN STREAM",,"Natl Inst Biol, Vecna Pot 111, Ljubljana 1001, Slovenia"
20,20,"Shen, GC",Apr 2022 ,Quantifying the Effects of Bed Roughness on Transit Time Distributions via Direct Numerical Simulations of Turbulent Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We report direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of hyporheic exchange for a flat river bed with two different particle roughness textures, at a surface flow friction Reynolds number of 395 and a bed permeability Reynolds number of 2.6. Transit time distributions (TTDs), subsurface flow patterns, and the interfacial volumetric fluxes are discussed. The transit time was quantified using a forward particle tracking method based on pure advection by three-dimensional, pore-resolved, time-mean velocities. Results show that bed roughness induces deep subsurface flow paths that yield a TTD with a power-law tail. Roughness obstructs the surface flow, creating interfacial pressure variations which induce subsurface flow. Next, the molecular diffusion is accounted for based on a random walk method and is shown to increase transit times regardless of roughness texture. This work demonstrates that particle roughness on a macroscopically flat sediment bed can induce significant hyporheic exchange that is fundamentally similar to that induced by bedforms.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000780813100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030503%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bthe%2BEffects%2Bof%2BBed%2BRoughness%2Bon%2BTransit%2BTime%2BDistributions%2Bvia%2BDirect%2BNumerical%2BSimulations%2Bof%2BTurbulent%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%26rft.aufirst%3DGuangchen%26rft.auinit%3DGC%26rft.aulast%3DShen%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030503%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DShen%252C%2BGC%26rft.au%3DYuan%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DPhanikumar%252C%2BMS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR030503,"hyporheic exchange,turbulence,transport,direct numerical simulation,roughness,residence time","NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSPORT,PERMEABILITY,STREAM,MODEL,FLOW",,"Michigan State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA"
21,21,"Liu, YH",Jun 2020 ,Influence of Streambed Heterogeneity on Hyporheic Flow and Sorptive Solute Transport,WATER,"The subsurface region where river water and groundwater actively mix (the hyporheic zone) plays an important role in conservative and reactive solute transport along rivers. Deposits of high-conductivity (K) sediments along rivers can strongly control hyporheic processes by channeling flow along preferential flow paths wherever they intersect the channel boundary. Our goal is to understand how sediment heterogeneity influences conservative and sorptive solute transport within hyporheic zones containing high- and low-Ksediment facies types. The sedimentary architecture of high-Kfacies is modeled using commonly observed characteristics (e.g., volume proportion and mean length), and their spatial connectivity is quantified to evaluate its effect on hyporheic mixing dynamics. Numerical simulations incorporate physical and chemical heterogeneity by representing spatial variability in bothKand in the sediment sorption distribution coefficient (Kd). Sediment heterogeneity significantly enhances hyporheic exchange and skews solute breakthrough behavior, while in homogeneous sediments, interfacial flux and solute transport are instead controlled by geomorphology and local-scale riverbed topographies. The hyporheic zone is compressed in sediments with high sorptive capacity, which limits solute interactions to only a small portion of the sedimentary architecture and thus increases retention. Our results have practical implications for groundwater quality, including remediation strategies for contaminants of emerging concern.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000549481000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1547%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2BStreambed%2BHeterogeneity%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2Band%2BSorptive%2BSolute%2BTransport%26rft.aufirst%3DYuanhong%26rft.auinit%3DYH%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12061547%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BYH%26rft.au%3DWallace%252C%2BCD%26rft.au%3DSoltanian%252C%2BMR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w12061547,"hyporheic exchange,riverbed heterogeneity,solute transport,sorption,mixing","UPSCALING RETARDATION FACTOR,HIERARCHICAL POROUS-MEDIA,BED FORMS,SPATIAL CORRELATION,NONSORBING SOLUTES,REACTIVE SOLUTES,EXCHANGE,RIVER,AQUIFER,DYNAMICS",,"Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA"
22,22,"Singley, JG",May 2017 ,Characterizing hyporheic exchange processes using high-frequency electrical conductivity-discharge relationships on subhourly to interannual timescales,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships are often used to quantify source water contributions and biogeochemical processes occurring within catchments, especially during discrete hydrological events. Yet, the interpretation of C-Q hysteresis is often confounded by complexity of the critical zone, such as numerous source waters and hydrochemical nonstationarity. Consequently, researchers must often ignore important runoff pathways and geochemical sources/sinks, especially the hyporheic zone because it lacks a distinct hydrochemical signature. Such simplifications limit efforts to identify processes responsible for the transience of C-Q hysteresis over time. To address these limitations, we leverage the hydrologic simplicity and long-term, high-frequency Q and electrical conductivity (EC) data from streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. In this two end-member system, EC can serve as a proxy for the concentration of solutes derived from the hyporheic zone. We utilize a novel approach to decompose loops into subhysteretic EC-Q dynamics to identify individual mechanisms governing hysteresis across a wide range of timescales. We find that hydrologic and hydraulic processes govern EC response to diel and seasonal Q variability and that the effects of hyporheic mixing processes on C-Q transience differ in short and long streams. We also observe that variable hyporheic turnover rates govern EC-Q patterns at daily to interannual timescales. Last, subhysteretic analysis reveals a period of interannual freshening of glacial meltwater streams related to the effects of unsteady flow on hyporheic exchange. The subhysteretic analysis framework we introduce may be applied more broadly to constrain the processes controlling C-Q transience and advance understanding of catchment evolution.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000403712100036,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCharacterizing%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bprocesses%2Busing%2Bhigh-frequency%2Belectrical%2Bconductivity-discharge%2Brelationships%2Bon%2Bsubhourly%2Bto%2Binterannual%2Btimescales%26rft.aufirst%3DJoel%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DJG%26rft.aulast%3DSingley%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019739%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4141%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4124-4141%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4124%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DSingley%252C%2BJG%26rft.au%3DWlostowski%252C%2BAN%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR019739,"hyporheic zone,electrical conductivity,concentration-discharge,Antarctica","MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS,HUMID HEADWATER CATCHMENTS,GLACIAL MELTWATER STREAMS,STORM RUNOFF GENERATION,TRANSIENT STORAGE,POLAR DESERT,HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY,WATER CHEMISTRY,FLOW,ZONE",,"Univ Colorado, Environm Studies Program, Boulder, CO 80309 USA"

The underlying assumption of the stationary, one-dimensional vertical flow field is frequently violated in natural systems where subsurface water flow often has a significant horizontal component. In this paper, we present a new methodology for identifying the geometry of the subsurface flow field using vertical temperature profiles. The statistical analyses are based on model optimisation and selection and are used to evaluate the shape of vertical amplitude ratio profiles. The method was applied to multiple profiles measured around in-stream geomorphological structures in a losing reach of a gravel bed river. The predominant subsurface flow field was systematically categorised in purely vertical and horizontal (hyporheic, parafluvial) components. The results highlight that river groundwater exchange flux at the head, crest and tail of geomorphological structures significantly deviated from the one-dimensional vertical flow, due to a significant horizontal component. The geometry of the subsurface water flow depended on the position around the geomorphological structures and on the river level. The methodology presented in this paper features great potential for characterising the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of complex subsurface flow geometries by using measured temperature time series in vertical profiles.

We examined how hyporheic (50 cm below surface) and benthic (surface) invertebrates responded to water pollution that originated from a point source (wastewater treatment plant) in a gravel-bed river in Hokkaido, Japan. Dissolved nutrient levels and algal biomass were significantly higher at sample sites down- than upstream of the point source. Furthermore, nitrate concentrations increased gradually from up- to downstream sites, which suggest the presence of diffuse pollution sources in the surrounding areas. Closely synchronized fluctuations of water temperature and similar water quality in the surface and hyporheic zones indicated that the hyporheic zone was highly hydrologically interactive with the surface water. Chloroperlidae (mostly Alloperla ishikariana) had a disproportionately high abundance in the hyporheic zone relative to the benthic zone, regardless of the surface water quality. Numerically dominant invertebrate taxa increased in abundance below the point source of pollution in both the benthic and hyporheic habitats. High N stable isotope ratios (SIR) of the invertebrates in both habitat types indicated that invertebrates assimilated anthropogenic N via the ingestion of pollution-contaminated food resources. End-member mixing analyses based on C SIR demonstrated that assimilation of anthropogenic N occurred because of the increase in available food resources originating from the biofilm. The trophic structure of invertebrates changed less markedly in the hyporheic zone than in the benthic zone, suggesting that the hyporheic assemblage was less sensitive than the benthic assemblage to the changes in surface water quality. Overall, our findings showed that the numeric responses of the invertebrate assemblage to anthropogenic changes in surface water quality were similar and coupled between the benthic and hyporheic zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000481502300013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Bbenthic-hyporheic%2Bresponses%2Bof%2Bmacroinvertebrates%2Bto%2Bsurface%2Bwater%2Bpollution%2Bin%2Ba%2Bgravel-bed%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DJunjiro%2BN.%26rft.auinit%3DJN%26rft.aulast%3DNegishi%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F705000%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D604%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D591-604%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D591%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DNegishi%252C%2BJN%26rft.au%3DHibino%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DToyoda%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/705000,"braided-channel,dietary carbon sources,point-source pollution,stable isotopes,subsurface","FOOD-CHAINS,PATTERNS,STREAMS,COMMUNITIES,GRADIENT,NITROGEN,ECOLOGY,ZONE,EUTROPHICATION,INVERTEBRATES",,"Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, N10,W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan"
25,25,"Casas-Mulet, R",Mar 15 2015 ,The effects of hydropeaking on hyporheic interactions based on field experiments,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hydropeaking power production has the potential to pose serious challenges towards hydrology, water quality and ecology in the downstream water bodies. The effects of such abrupt changes of flow in hyporheic exchange have been explored in a few cases in the literature. This paper extends previous works with a study of finer time resolution in a river of a smaller size and with different climatic characteristics, adding to the current knowledge of peaking-hyporheic interactions. A high-frequency logging field experiment measuring hyporheic flow and temperature was conducted on a similar to 30x20m gravel bar frequently exposed to dry conditions because of fast and abrupt flow changes. This study demonstrates that hyporheic processes are sensitive to hydropeaking with respect to rates of change, durations and temperature. Differences BETWEEN individual events, seasons, watering and dewatering processes and positions in the river bed that can be potentially relevant to ecology were investigated. Understanding the complexity of those processes at the fine scale from the physical point of view is both important for the judgement of potential ecological impacts and for the future management of such regulated systems.

Understanding the effects of daily groundwater table fluctuations on the tightly coupled flow and heat transport within hyporheic zones is crucial for water resources management. With this aim in mind, a physically based model is used to explore hyporheic responses to varying groundwater table fluctuation scenarios. The effects of different timing and amplitude of groundwater table daily drawdowns under gaining and losing conditions are explored in hyporheic zones influenced by natural flood events and diel river temperature fluctuations. We find that both diel river temperature fluctuations and daily groundwater table drawdowns play important roles in determining the spatiotemporal variability of hyporheic exchange rates, temperature of exfiltrating hyporheic fluxes, mean residence times, and hyporheic denitrification potentials. Groundwater table dynamics present substantially distinct impacts on hyporheic exchange under gaining or losing conditions. The timing of groundwater table drawdown has a direct influence on hyporheic exchange rates and hyporheic buffering capacity on thermal disturbances. Consequently, the selection of aquifer pumping regimes has significant impacts on the dispersal of pollutants in the aquifer and thermal heterogeneity in the sediment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000639027600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2Bdaily%2Bgroundwater%2Btable%2Bdrawdown%2Baffects%2Bthe%2Bdiel%2Brhythm%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DLiwen%26rft.auinit%3DLW%26rft.aulast%3DWu%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-25-1905-2021%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D1921%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1905-1921%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1905%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BLW%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/hess-25-1905-2021,,"STREAM TEMPERATURE,RESIDENCE TIMES,WATER INTERFACE,THERMAL REGIME,ZONE,FLOW,DISCHARGE,DYNAMICS,DENITRIFICATION,PERSPECTIVE",,"Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Dept Ecohydrol, Berlin, Germany"
27,27,"PALMER, MA",Feb 1992 ,RESPONSE OF INVERTEBRATES TO LOTIC DISTURBANCE - A TEST OF THE HYPORHEIC REFUGE HYPOTHESIS,OECOLOGIA,"Recovery following hydrological disturbances is usually rapid for lotic invertebrates. Stream ecologists have assumed that recovery is facilitated by behavioral migrations during floods down into the hyporheic zone (the interstitial spaces of a streambed) to seek temporary refuge from possible erosion (the ""hyporheic refuge hypothesis""). We provide the first explicit test of this hypothesis by evaluating three predictions of the hypothesis. We coupled field observations of the response of meiofaunal invertebrates to floods with field and flume experiments. The study site was a sandy-bottom stream in northern Virginia. Prediction 1, that loss of fauna from a streambed during floods should be minimal as long as the depth of scour in the streambed is less than the depth of the hyporheic zone, was not supported for any taxon. For two floods which varied considerably in magnitude, 50-90% of the fauna was lost from the bed despite the fact that the depth of scour (10-30 cm) was significantly less than the total depth of the hyporheic zone (50 cm). Prediction 2, that fauna should move deeper into the bed at higher flows, was supported by field observations during only one of two floods and then only for rotifers. In flume experiments that tested for finer scale behavioral movements, significant vertical migrations were found for copepods and chironomids which moved 1.5-3.5 cm downward as mean velocity (3 cm off bottom) was increased from 5-23 cm/s. Movements down by rotifers were not found in the flume experiments. Prediction 3, that the hyporheic zone is the most important source of colonists to defaunated areas, was supported in part by field experiments. The hyporheic route was not the primary route for any taxon but it was as important for the rotifers and copepods as water column or streambed surface routes. We conclude that, even though small-scale (cm's) migrations into the streambed in response to increased flow may be observed for some taxa and the hyporheic zone may serve as a partial source of colonists following disturbances, movements down are not adequate in preventing significant losses of meiofauna during floods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1992HC11200006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRESPONSE%2BOF%2BINVERTEBRATES%2BTO%2BLOTIC%2BDISTURBANCE%2B-%2BA%2BTEST%2BOF%2BTHE%2BHYPORHEIC%2BREFUGE%2BHYPOTHESIS%26rft.aufirst%3DMA%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DPALMER%26rft.date%3D1992%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00317217%26rft.epage%3D194%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-8549%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DOECOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D182-194%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D182%26rft.stitle%3DOECOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D89%26rft.au%3DPALMER%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DBELY%252C%2BAE%26rft.au%3DBERG%252C%2BKE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=OECOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/BF00317217,"HYPORHEIC,REFUGE,FLOODS,STREAMS,MEIOFAUNA","VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION,NAIDIDAE OLIGOCHAETA,MARINE MEIOFAUNA,STREAM,SEDIMENT,RECOVERY,DISPERSAL,DYNAMICS,RECOLONIZATION,COLONIZATION",,"UNIV MARYLAND,DEPT ZOOL,COLLEGE PK,MD 20742, USA"
28,28,"McCallum, JL",Mar 2020 ,A Numerical Stream Transport Modeling Approach Including Multiple Conceptualizations of Hyporheic Exchange and Spatial Variability to Assess Contaminant Removal,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Understanding the mechanisms and controls on contaminant removal in streams is essential in managing human and ecosystem health. The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays a key role in the removal of contaminants from streams. Often, tracer tests are implemented in conjunction with measurements of compounds to assess the removal rates of contaminants in streams. The predicted removal rates largely rely on the estimated hyporheic residence time, and hence, the chosen conceptual model of hyporheic exchange flows (HEFs) will influence the predicted removal rate. Despite this, different HEF models are generally not considered when assessing contaminant removal rates. In this paper, we present a numerical modeling approach for interpreting tracer tests to determine contaminant removal rates that allows for multiple conceptual models of HEF to be considered. We demonstrate this method by interpreting data from a conservative tracer test in conjunction with grab samples of trace organic compounds using two commonly used models of HEF: one that assumes first-order exchange between the stream and the HZ and one that considers a power law weighting of first-order exchange coefficients. For the three degrading compounds measured, guanylurea, valsartan, and diclofenac, we observed that the power law model consistently predicted higher removal rates in the stream compared to the first-order model. Variations were also observed between the removal rates estimated in the HZ. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple conceptualizations of the HEF when assessing contaminant removal rates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000538000800015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR024987%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BNumerical%2BStream%2BTransport%2BModeling%2BApproach%2BIncluding%2BMultiple%2BConceptualizations%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Band%2BSpatial%2BVariability%2Bto%2BAssess%2BContaminant%2BRemoval%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DMcCallum%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR024987%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DMcCallum%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DHohne%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR024987,,"LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION COEFFICIENT,TRANSIT-TIME DISTRIBUTIONS,REACTIVE TRANSPORT,GROUNDWATER AGE,LIFE EXPECTANCY,TRACER TEST,STORAGE,FATE,PHARMACEUTICALS,DENITRIFICATION",,"Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia"

We developed a comprehensive framework relating diel hydrologic fluctuations to hyporheic exchange in the absence of geomorphic complexity. We simulated groundwater flow through an aquifer bounded by a straight stream and hillslope and under time-varying boundary conditions. We found that diel fluctuations can produce hyporheic flow path lengths and residence times that span orders of magnitude. With these results, hyporheic flow path residence times and lengths can be predicted from the timing and magnitude of diel fluctuations and valley slope. Finally, we demonstrated that dynamic hydrologic boundary conditions can produce spatial and temporal scales of hyporheic flow paths equivalent to those driven by many well-studied geomorphic features, indicating that these controls must be considered together in future efforts of upscaling to stream networks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000378339200040,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bcontrolled%2Bby%2Bdynamic%2Bhydrologic%2Bboundary%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DNoah%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DNM%26rft.aulast%3DSchmadel%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016GL068286%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D4417%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4408-4417%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4408%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DSchmadel%252C%2BNM%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DMalzone%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016GL068286,,"WATER-GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,RIPARIAN ZONE,FLOW,DENITRIFICATION,DISCHARGE,SEDIMENT,AQUIFER,INTERFACE,MECHANICS,NITRATE",,"Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA"

To better understand transport and transformation of metal ions in the hyporheic zone, flume experiments and numerical simulations were performed in a streambed with periodic bedforms using zinc ions. Compared to non-adsorbing contaminant, the results show that adsorption leads to a more rapid decrease in the concentration of Zn2+ in the overlying water, and a lower final concentration is reached. The mass of adsorbed ions is several times higher than that of free ions in the bedform's water phase. Indeed, metal adsorption is in the shallow layer of the streambed. Although this prevents heavy metal groundwater contamination, the same cannot be said of shallow layer of the hyporheic zone.

Here, we modelled a newly discovered product-to-parent reversion pathway for trenbolone acetate (TBA) metabolites. We show increased exposure to the primary metabolite, 17 alpha-trenbolone (17 alpha-TBOH), and elevated concentrations of the still-bioactive primary photoproduct hydroxylated 17 alpha-TBOH, produced via phototransformation and then converted back to 17 alpha-trenbolone in perpetually dark hyporheic zones that exchange continuously with surface water photic zones. The increased persistence equates to a greater potential hazard from parent-product joint bioactivity at locations and times when reversion is a dominant trenbolone fate pathway.

Good estimation of the traveltime distribution in the hyporheic zone is required to achieve a better understanding of transport in the river system. The transient-storage model has been accepted as an appropriate tool for reach-scale transport in rivers undergoing hyporheic exchange, but the choice of the best parametric function for the hyporheic traveltime distribution has remained unclear. We present an approach to obtaining hyporheic traveltime distributions from synchronous conservative and ""smart'' tracer experiments that does not rely on a particular functional form of the hyporheic traveltime distribution, but treats the latter as a continuous function. Nonnegativity of the hyporheic traveltime distribution is enforced by the application of Lagrange multipliers. A smoothness parameter, needed for regularization, and uncertainty bounds are obtained by the expectation-maximization method relying on conditional realizations. The shape-free inference provides the opportunity for capturing unconventional shapes, e. g., multiple peaks, in the estimation. We test the approach by applying it to a virtual test case with a bimodal hyporheic traveltime distribution, which is recaptured in the inversion of noisy data.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000292611700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW07510%26rft.atitle%3DShape-free%2Binference%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Btraveltime%2Bdistributions%2Bfrom%2Bsynthetic%2Bconservative%2Band%2B%2522smart%2527%2527%2Btracer%2Btests%2Bin%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DZijie%26rft.auinit%3DZJ%26rft.aulast%3DLiao%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR009927%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DLiao%252C%2BZJ%26rft.au%3DCirpka%252C%2BOA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2010WR009927,,"TRANSIENT STORAGE,RESIDENCE TIME,SURFACE-WATER,GROUND-WATER,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,BANK FILTRATION,ZONE,TEMPERATURE,EXCHANGE,AQUIFERS",,"Univ Tubingen, Ctr Appl Geosci, Holderlinstr 12, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany"

Field and laboratory experiments show that advective exchange through the underlying sediments is an important mechanism of solutes transport and storage in riverine systems. Here, Transient Storage Model parameters are obtained for reactive solute exchange driven by bedform-induced advection. Consideration of exchange induced by this single mechanism allows specific relationships between model parameters and system properties like solute reactivity to be identified. This work shows that when a simplified model like the Transient Storage Model is applied to analyze metal storage in river sediments, particular attention must be devoted to the choice of modeling parameters.

34,34,"Moore, RD",Aug 30 2005 ,"Thermal regime of a headwater stream within a clear-cut, coastal British Columbia, Canada",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This study examined the thermal regime of a headwater stream within a clear-cut. The stream had a complex morphology dominated by step-pool features, many formed by sediment accumulation upstream of woody debris. Maximum daily temperatures increased up to 5 degrees C after logging, and were positively associated with maximum daily air temperature and negatively with discharge. Maximum daily temperatures generally increased with downstream distance through the cut block, but decreased with distance in two segments over distances of tens of metres, where the topography indicated relatively concentrated lateral inflow. Localized cool areas within a step-pool unit were associated with zones of concentrated upwelling. Bed temperatures tended to be higher and have greater ranges in areas of downwelling flow into the bed. Heat budget estimates were made using meteorological measurements over the water surface and a model of net radiation using canopy characteristics derived from fisheye photography. Heat exchange driven by hyporheic flow through the channel step was a cooling effect during daytime, with a magnitude up to approximately 25% that of net radiation during the period of maximum daytime warming. Heat budget calculations in these headwater streams are complicated by the heterogeneity of incident solar radiation and channel geometry, as well as uncertainty in estimating heat and water exchanges between the stream and the subsurface via hyporheic exchange and heat conduction.

35,35,"Tonina, D",Jan 31 2007 ,Hyporheic exchange in gravel bed rivers with pool-riffle morphology: Laboratory experiments and three-dimensional modeling,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[ 1] We report the first laboratory simulations of hyporheic exchange in gravel pool-riffle channels, which are characterized by coarse sediment, steep slopes, and three-dimensional bed forms that strongly influence surface flow. These channels are particularly important habitat for salmonids, many of which are currently at risk worldwide and which incubate their offspring within the hyporheic zone. Here we perform a set of laboratory experiments examining the effects of discharge and bed form amplitude on hyporheic exchange, with surface-subsurface mixing measured directly from the concentration decay of a conservative tracer ( fluorescein) injected into the surface flow. Near-bed pressure measurements were also used to predict hyporheic exchange from a three-dimensional pumping transport model. Comparison of the predicted and observed hyporheic exchange shows good agreement, indicating that the major mechanism for exchange is bed form - induced advection. However, the effect of bed forms is modulated by discharge and the degree of topographic submergence. We also tested the performance of the hydrostatic pressure as a proxy for the observed near-bed pressure in driving hyporheic exchange, which would facilitate field measurement and analysis of hyporheic flow in natural rivers. We found agreement with measured hyporheic exchange only for low bed form amplitudes and high flows.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000244043000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW01421%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bgravel%2Bbed%2Brivers%2Bwith%2Bpool-riffle%2Bmorphology%253A%2BLaboratory%2Bexperiments%2Band%2Bthree-dimensional%2Bmodeling%26rft.aufirst%3DDaniele%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DTonina%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2005WR004328%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DBuffington%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2005WR004328,,"CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,HYDRAULIC ROUGHNESS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,MOUNTAIN STREAM,CHANNEL-TYPE,FLOW,SALMON,FORMS,RESISTANCE,DISCHARGE",,"US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Boise, ID 83702 USA"

However, it remains uncertain how physical characteristics of streambeds affect the magnitude and net outcome of subsurface nitrogen transformations. We tested whether the size distribution of streambed sediments, in isolation from the influence of streambed topography and groundwater upwelling, could affect net DIN uptake or production along interstitial flow paths. Mesocosms constructed from PVC pipe (15 cm diameter x 1 m long) were filled with either coarse gravel/cobble or gravel/cobble mixed with finer sediments (5 mesocosms per sediment treatment). Mesocosms were submerged in a stream and oriented, so that surface water flowed through the sediments. After 2 months incubation, we measured DIN in interstitial water at 20 cm intervals and dissolved oxygen at 10 cm intervals along mesocosm flow paths. In both sediment types, DIN concentrations increased longitudinally along mesocosm flow paths in the direction of interstitial flow, indicating net DIN production. Although DIN increased to higher concentrations in mesocosms with fine sediments, greater exchange flow through coarse sediments resulted in similar rates of net DIN production and delivery to surface water. Production of DIN in both sediment types was concentrated within the first 10 cm of interstitial flow paths, with no significant production further along the flow paths. Coarse sediments had higher rates of oxygen consumption per unit sediment volume than the coarse-fine sediment mix, suggesting interstitial water velocity may be an important factor affecting hyporheic microbial metabolism.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000284598200028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNet%2Bdissolved%2Binorganic%2Bnitrogen%2Bproduction%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bmesocosms%2Bwith%2Bcontrasting%2Bsediment%2Bsize%2Bdistributions%26rft.aufirst%3DBrett%2BN.%26rft.auinit%3DBN%26rft.aulast%3DHarvey%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-010-0504-4%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D352%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D343-352%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D343%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D658%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BBN%26rft.au%3DJohnson%252C%2BML%26rft.au%3DGreen%252C%2BPG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-010-0504-4,"Hyporheic exchange flow,Stream,Sediment size,Respiration,Nitrate production","EXCHANGE PROCESSES,WATER EXCHANGE,MASS-TRANSPORT,TROPHIC STATE,STREAMS,RIVER,DENITRIFICATION,NITRIFICATION,RETENTION,ZONE",,"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Watershed Sci, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA"

Based on field measurements in a variety of sedimentary habitats typical for a large lowland river (Elbe, Germany), we present results on the abundance and production of sedimentary bacteria, the potential activity of a set of extracellular enzymes, and potential nitrification and denitrification rates. A diving bell was used to access the sediments in the central river channel, enabling us to sample down to 1 m sediment depth. Depth gradients of all measures of microbial activity were controlled by sediment structure, hydraulic conditions, as well as by the supply with organic carbon and nitrogen. Microbial heterotrophic activity was tightly coupled with the availability of carbon and nitrogen, whereas chemolithotrophic activity (nitrification rate) was related to the available surface area of particles. In the central bed of the river, bacterial production and extracellular enzyme activity remained high down to the deepest sediment layers investigated. Due to the large inner surface area and their connectivity with the surface water, the shifting sediments in the central channel of the river were microbially highly active There, vertically integrated bacterial production amounted to 0.95 g C m(-3) h(-1), which was 2.9 to 5.5 times higher than in the nearshore habitats. We conclude that carbon and nitrogen cycling in the river is controlled by the live sediments of the central river channel, which thus represent a ""liver function"" in the river's metabolism.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000233242400008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Briver%2527s%2Bliver%2B-%2Bmicrobial%2Bprocesses%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Blarge%2Blowland%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DH%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DFischer%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-005-6896-y%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D371%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D349-371%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D349%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D76%26rft.au%3DFischer%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DKloep%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DPusch%252C%2BMT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10533-005-6896-y,"bacteria,hyporheic,large river,metabolism,sediments","EXTRACELLULAR ENZYME-ACTIVITY,ORGANIC-MATTER,BACTERIAL PRODUCTION,NITROGEN TRANSFORMATIONS,AQUATIC SEDIMENTS,MARINE SEDIMENT,UPLAND STREAM,CARBON,DENITRIFICATION,DYNAMICS",,"Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Muggelseedamm 301, D-12587 Berlin, Germany"

Most existing models use a sequential, one-way coupling between the surface and subsurface domains. Such one-way coupling potentially introduces error. To overcome this, a fully coupled model, hyporheicFoam, was developed using the open-source computational platform OpenFOAM. It captures the coupled flow and multicomponent reactive transport processes within both surface and subsurface domains and across their interface. The coupling between two domains is implemented by mapping conservative flux boundary conditions at the interface through an iterative algorithm. Reactive transport is enabled by specifying a reaction network. To start, we have implemented reaction kinetics following the double Monod-type model with inhibition. The model capability is illustrated through modeling of both conservative and reactive hyporheic flow and transport through dune bedforms. With the novel coupled model, it is now possible to quantify reactions wherein the reactants and products are constantly exchanging between domains and have feedbacks. hyporheicFoam can simulate large, three-dimensional cases owing to the computational flexibility and power offered by the code structure and parallel design of OpenFOAM.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000535672800069,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR026528%26rft.atitle%3DFlexible%2Band%2BModular%2BSimultaneous%2BModeling%2Bof%2BFlow%2Band%2BReactive%2BTransport%2Bin%2BRivers%2Band%2BHyporheic%2BZones%26rft.aufirst%3DBing%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR026528%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BXF%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR026528,"hyporheic flow,reactive transport,computer modeling,turbulent flow",DRIVEN,,"Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA"

Detailed analyses of water isotopes, major and trace elements, and in situ water quality data for an individual flood event reveal that baseflow contributions rise by 8% only 320 m downstream of the point where this particular channel changes from cement-lined to unlined. However, additional hydrograph separations indicate baseflow contributions are variable and can be much higher (average baseflow increase is 16%). Stream electrical conductivity (EC) and solute concentrations in the lined reach were up to 25% lower during peak flow than in the unlined channel, indicating a greater event flow fraction. In contrast, during low flow, stream EC and solute concentrations in the lined reach were up to 30% higher due to the restricted inflow of more dilute groundwater. Over longer timescales, EC, solute concentrations, turbidity, and bacterial loads decrease downstream signifying increasing contributions of dilute baseflow. The decreased connectivity of surface waters and groundwaters along the hyporheic zone in lined channels increases the hydrologic and geochemical variability of urban streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000369239800012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bzone%2Bflow%2Bdisruption%2Bfrom%2Bchannel%2Blinings%253A%2BImplications%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bhydrology%2Band%2Bgeochemistry%2Bof%2Ban%2Burban%2Bstream%252C%2BSt.%2BLouis%252C%2BMissouri%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DElizabeth%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DEA%26rft.aulast%3DHasenmueller%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12583-016-0632-5%26rft.eissn%3D1867-111X%26rft.epage%3D109%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1674-487X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D98-109%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D98%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BEARTH%2BSCI-CHINA%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DHasenmueller%252C%2BEA%26rft.au%3DRobinson%252C%2BHK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+EARTH+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12583-016-0632-5,"stream channel linings,hyporheic zone,groundwater-surface water interactions,flood hydrograph,urban geochemistry,urban streams","GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,RUNOFF,HYDROGRAPH,TRANSPORT,IMPACTS,OREGON,RIVER",,"St Louis Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, St Louis, MO 63108 USA"
40,40,"Ward, AS",Mar 2018 ,Time-Variable Transit Time Distributions in the Hyporheic Zone of a Headwater Mountain Stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Exchange of water between streams and their hyporheic zones is known to be dynamic in response to hydrologic forcing, variable in space, and to exist in a framework with nested flow cells. The expected result of heterogeneous geomorphic setting, hydrologic forcing, and between-feature interaction is hyporheic transit times that are highly variable in both space and time. Transit time distributions (TTDs) are important as they reflect the potential for hyporheic processes to impact biogeochemical transformations and ecosystems. In this study we simulate time-variable transit time distributions based on dynamic vertical exchange in a headwater mountain stream with observed, heterogeneous step-pool morphology. Our simulations include hyporheic exchange over a 600 m river corridor reach driven by continuously observed, time-variable hydrologic conditions for more than 1 year. We found that spatial variability at an instance in time is typically larger than temporal variation for the reach. Furthermore, we found reach-scale TTDs were marginally variable under all but the most extreme hydrologic conditions, indicating that TTDs are highly transferable in time. Finally, we found that aggregation of annual variation in space and time into a master TTD reasonably represents most of the hydrologic dynamics simulated, suggesting that this aggregation approach may provide a relevant basis for scaling from features or short reaches to entire networks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000430364900034,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTime-Variable%2BTransit%2BTime%2BDistributions%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bof%2Ba%2BHeadwater%2BMountain%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR021502%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2036%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2017-2036%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2017%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DSchmadel%252C%2BNM%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017WR021502,,"SURFACE-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSPORT,STORAGE,BED,DISCHARGE,OREGON",,"Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA"
41,41,"Mendoza-Lera, C",Oct 2019 ,Exploring the role of hydraulic conductivity on the contribution of the hyporheic zone to in-stream nitrogen uptake,ECOHYDROLOGY,"Nitrogen uptake (N-uptake) within the hyporheic zone provides key ecological services, such as nutrient removal, of stream ecosystems. We hypothesize that the hydraulic conductivity (Kf) of the hyporheic sediments governs nutrient uptake rates through effects on the (a) surface and subsurface flow (i.e., hyporheic flow) and (b) hyporheic N-uptake. Here, we worked at two hierarchical spatial scales (reach and hyporheic scale) to disentangle the role of Kf on N-uptake. At the reach scale, we performed coinjected N-NH4+ and Cl- additions in six reaches with contrasting reach Kf (10(-1)-10(-5) m/s) and simultaneously determined (a) in-stream N-uptake (hyporheic+benthic N-uptake) and (b) hyporheic flow, and (c) N-uptake and microbial community abundance at the hyporheic scale. Results suggest that Kf determines the contribution of the hyporheic zone to hydrological exchange but that its role varies between scales to determine in-stream N-uptake. At the reach scale, Kf variability seems to determine the extent at which the hyporheic zone contributes to hyporheic flow and, thus, to N-uptake velocity. At the hyporheic scale, Kf seems to indirectly determine hyporheic N-uptake through the proportion of surface water that enters the hyporheic zone (i.e., relative connectivity) and the abundance of the microbial community. These results suggest an interplay between Kf at both scales and its spatial heterogeneity, which will ultimately drive in-stream N-uptake at reach scale. In this sense, we found that Kf can be considered as a unifying variable for stream biogeochemical processes and as an important variable to derive the contribution of hyporheic zone to in-stream nutrient removal capacity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000491982700004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2139%26rft.atitle%3DExploring%2Bthe%2Brole%2Bof%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bcontribution%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bto%2Bin-stream%2Bnitrogen%2Buptake%26rft.aufirst%3DClara%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DMendoza-Lera%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Feco.2139%26rft.eissn%3D1936-0592%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1936-0584%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DECOHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOHYDROLOGY%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DMendoza-Lera%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DRibot%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=ECOHYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/eco.2139,"ammonia oxidizers,AOA,AOB,clogging,siltation,stream biogeochemistry","ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES,TRANSIENT STORAGE,MASS-TRANSFER,SURFACE-AREA,SEDIMENT,EXCHANGE,RETENTION,RESTORATION,SERVICES,CARBON",,"Ctr Lyon Villeurbanne, Irstea, UR RiverLy, 5 Rue Doua, F-69625 Villeurbanne, France"
42,42,"Crispell, JK",Apr 15 2009 ,Hyporheic exchange flow around constructed in-channel structures and implications for restoration design,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In-channel rock vane structures are widely used in stream restoration as a way to reduce stream channel erosion and create pool or riffle features. When these structures change hydraulic gradients they may affect ecological stream functions, such as hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) patterns. A study of constructed in-channel structure controls on HEF was conducted in the third-order Batavia Kill, New York using stream and hyporheic temperature amplitude analysis and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) hydraulic simulations. Temperature monitors were installed in the water column and channel bed at six locations around each of seven in-channel restoration structures (three cross-vanes and four J-hooks) at baseflow in 2007. Elevation surveys of the structures were then used to simulate HEF using CFD. The results indicate a pattern of pronounced upwelling in the run section just below the structure, upwelling transitioning to downwelling within the pool, and pronounced downwelling in the glide out of the pool. This pattern is consistent with natural riffle pool sequences. The direction of HEF inferred from the temperature amplitude analysis agreed with the direction of flow simulated with CFD at 80% of the locations, and the few disagreements were expected due to model limitations.

43,43,"Jones, KL",Jun 30 2008 ,"Geomorphology, hydrology, and aquatic vegetation drive seasonal hyporheic flow patterns across a gravel-dominated floodplain",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Across 1.7 km(2) of the Umatilla River floodplain (Oregon, USA), we investigated the influences of an ephemeral tributary and perennial 'spring channel' (fed only by upwelling groundwater) on hyporheic hydrology. We derived maps of winter and summer water-table elevations from data collected at 46 monitoring wells and 19 stage gauges and used resulting maps to infer groundwater flow direction. Groundwater flow direction varied seasonally across the floodplain and was influenced by main channel stage, flooding, the tributary creek, and the location and direction of hyporheic exchange in the spring channel. Hyporheic exchange in the spring channel was evaluated with a geochemical mixing model, which confirmed patterns of floodplain groundwater movement inferred from water-table maps and showed that the spring channel was fed predominantly by hyporheic water from the floodplain aquifer (87% during winter, 80% during summer), with its remaining flow supplied by upslope groundwater from the adjacent catchment aquifer. Summertime growth of aquatic macrophytes in the spring channel also influenced patterns of hyporheic exchange and groundwater flow, direction in the alluvial aquifer by increasing flow resistance in the spring channel, locally raising surface water stage and adjacent water-table elevation, and thereby altering the slope of the water-table in the hyporheic zone. The Umatilla River floodplain is larger than most sites where hyporheic hydrology has been investigated in detail. Yet, our results corroborate other research that has identified off-channel geomorphic features as important drivers of hyporheic hydrology, including previously published modeling efforts from a similar river and field observations from smaller streams.

45,45,"Ward, AS",Aug 16 2011 ,How can subsurface modifications to hydraulic conductivity be designed as stream restoration structures? Analysis of Vaux's conceptual models to enhance hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Despite the growing interest in hyporheic exchange and the associated stream ecosystem processes, few studies consider restoration of hyporheic exchange as a design goal. Here we study the design of three types of subsurface structures for hyporheic restoration after conceptual designs published over 40 years ago. Vaux's designs involve modifying the subsurface with low or high hydraulic conductivity material placed at the streambed or adjacent to a confining layer below the stream. In this preliminary analysis of subsurface structure design we use two-dimensional groundwater flow modeling of structures to simulate structure performance in plane bed streams for ranges of structure geometric design and hydraulic conductivities. Structure performance is evaluated on the basis of total streambed flux, physical extent of hyporheic flow paths created, and residence time distributions along flow paths modified by the structures. High hydraulic conductivity structures bend flow paths toward and through the structures themselves; performance is controlled by the structure hydraulic conductivity. Results show low hydraulic conductivity structure performance is insensitive to the structure material; hyporheic exchange is created by deflecting flow paths away from the structure itself. Time scales of simulated exchange are great enough to promote nitrification, denitrification, respiration, and thermal buffering in the subsurface, though these processes will also be controlled by site-specific chemical and biological factors. General design recommendations for specific restoration objectives are presented. Results of this study can be extrapolated to further understand the interaction of natural subsurface heterogeneities (e. g., clay and gravel deposits and bedrock knickpoints) and flow fields in creating hyporheic flow paths.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000294127000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08512%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2Bcan%2Bsubsurface%2Bmodifications%2Bto%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bbe%2Bdesigned%2Bas%2Bstream%2Brestoration%2Bstructures%253F%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BVaux%2527s%2Bconceptual%2Bmodels%2Bto%2Benhance%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR010028%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DJohnson%252C%2BPA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2010WR010028,,"REGULATED CALIFORNIA RIVER,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,WATER EXCHANGE,MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,HEADWATER STREAMS,MOUNTAIN STREAM,REACH-SCALE,NEW-ZEALAND",,"Univ Iowa, Dept Geosci, 36 Trowbridge Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA"
46,46,"Heffernan, JB",Oct 2008 ,Consequences of a biogeomorphic regime shift for the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran Desert stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Feedbacks between vegetation and geomorphic processes can generate alternative stable states and other nonlinear behaviours in ecological systems, but the consequences of these biogeomorphic interactions for other ecosystem processes are poorly understood. In this study, we describe the changes in the hydrological, geomorphic and biogeochemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran desert stream (Sycamore Creek, Arizona, U.S.A.) in response to a transition from an unvegetated gravel-bed state to densely vegetated wetlands (cienegas).2. A survey of the entire length of Sycamore Creek indicated that cienegas occupied c. 18% of the stream, and were disproportionately represented in constrained canyons rather than wide, unconstrained valleys.3. Vegetated patches were characterized by low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate and high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in the hyporheic zone. In contrast to unvegetated areas, hyporheic DO in cienegas exhibited no relationship with vertical hydraulic gradients.4. Increases in hyporheic DO following removal of vegetation by floods supports the hypothesis that these reduced conditions were the result of biogeochemical and geomorphic changes associated with vegetation establishment. In locations where vegetation persisted, hyporheic DO exhibited no response to flooding; in sections where vegetation was removed hyporheic DO closely tracked post-flood increases in surface stream DO.5.Shallow sediments in vegetated patches were finer and more organic-rich than in unvegetated patches, due to increased deposition during floods. Conservative tracer additions indicated that hydrological exchange between the surface stream and hyporheic zone was much lower in cienegas than in gravel-bed reaches.6. Vegetation establishment in desert streams not only alters the physical and chemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone, but also the nature of interactions between surface and hyporheic subsystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000259148200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConsequences%2Bof%2Ba%2Bbiogeomorphic%2Bregime%2Bshift%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2BSonoran%2BDesert%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DJB%26rft.aulast%3DHeffernan%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2008.02019.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1968%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1954-1968%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1954%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DHeffernan%252C%2BJB%26rft.au%3DSponseller%252C%2BRA%26rft.au%3DFisher%252C%2BSG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02019.x,"flood disturbance,grazing,hydrological exchange,macrophytes,wetland","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,RIPARIAN VEGETATION,SELF-ORGANIZATION,NITROGEN,SEDIMENT,GEOMORPHOLOGY,ECOSYSTEMS,CORRIDORS,STABILITY,TRANSPORT",,"Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA"
47,47,"Li, Y",Sep 1 2020 ,Grain size tunes microbial community assembly and nitrogen transformation activity under frequent hyporheic exchange: A column experiment,WATER RESEARCH,"Hyporheic zones (HZ) are hotspots for biogeochemical reactions where groundwater and surface water mix. River dam buildings and other hydrologic controls alter the sediment grain size distribution and modify the downstream hyporheic exchange, with cascading effects on geochemical and microbial processes in river corridors. In this lab-scale column experiment, the N transformations in HZ filled with sediments in different grain sizes were investigated with a focus on understanding the interplay among variational hydraulic connectivity, microbial community structure, functional potential under frequent groundwater-surface water exchange. Porosity was identified as the main driver determining bacterial community assembly in HZ sediments. Significant microbial zonation was observed along the columns and the degree of co-occurrence of bacterial communities in the Fine column was lower than that in the Coarse and Mix columns. The Coarse column allowed for almost 2.47 times the exchange flux relative to the Fine column, and generates the fastest DO consumption rate (-6.52 mu g O-2/L.s). The enrichment of nitriflers, i.e., Cytophagaceae and Bacillaceae and nitrification functional genes, i.e., amoA_AOA and amoA_AOB revealed the higher nitrification potential in column filled with coarse sediments. In com- parison, the highest NH4+ production rates (2.4 x 10(-3) mu g N/L.s) took place in Fine column. The higher abundancies of denitriflers such as Comamonadaceae and Lysobacter and enrichment of functional genes of nirK and nirS interestingly suggested the elevated denitrification potential in Fine column in a more anaerobic environment. The results implied that variations in microbial functional potential and associated nitrogen transformation may occur in size-fractioned HZ to dynamic hyporheic exchange, which added new knowledge to the underlying biogeochemical and ecological processes in regulated river corridors.

The models were based on topographic surveys of the stream channel and surrounding floodplain, and surveyed water surface elevations (WSEs) were used to assign stream boundary conditions. Using the groundwater flow model, MODFLOW, and the particle tracking model, MODPATH, we calculated hyporheic exchange fluxes, their residence time distributions, and both longitudinal and plan view spatial patterns of downwelling and upwelling zones. In the first few years, streambed scour and sediment deposition smoothed the streambed and WSE profile, reducing HEF. Also, large contiguous patches of downwelling or upwelling were fragmented, nearly doubling the total number of patches present on the streambed. As the stream continued to adjust to the loss of wood, those trends began to reverse. Accretion of sediment onto alternating bars resulted in better developed pool-riffle morphology, enhanced HEF, and increased residence times and also resulted in downwelling and upwelling zones coalescing into elongated patches along bar margins. This study showed that the hyporheic zone is sensitive to changes in wood loading and that initial changes in HEF resulting from the direct effects of wood removal were contrary to longer-term channel adjustments to changes in wood loading.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000265933500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW05406%26rft.atitle%3DChanges%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bflow%2Bfollowing%2Bexperimental%2Bwood%2Bremoval%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsmall%252C%2Blow-gradient%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DSteven%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DWondzell%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007214%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DLaNier%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DEdwards%252C%2BRT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2008WR007214,,"CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,BEDLOAD TRANSPORT,CHINOOK SALMON,SLUG TEST,DEBRIS,FOREST,GEOMORPHOLOGY,HETEROGENEITY,TEMPERATURE",,"US Forest Serv, Olympia Forestry Sci Lab, Pacific NW Res Stn, USDA, Olympia, WA 98512 USA"
49,49,"Drummond, JD",Apr 2018 ,"Less Fine Particle Retention in a Restored Versus Unrestored Urban Stream: Balance Between Hyporheic Exchange, Resuspension, and Immobilization",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Stream restoration goals include reducing erosion and increasing hyporheic exchange to promote biogeochemical processing and improve water quality. Little is known, however, about fine particle dynamics in response to stream restoration. Fine particles (<100 mu m) are exchanged with transient storage areas near and within streambeds and banks. Fine particle retention directly impacts carbon and nutrient cycling by supporting benthic and hyporheic primary production, but overaccumulation of fine particle deposits can impair metabolism by burying benthic biofilms and reducing streambed permeability. We analyzed the transport and retention of water and fine particles at both the reach and local scales in a restored urban stream, 9years postrestoration. We injected conservative solute and fine particle tracers under summer baseflow conditions and monitored their distribution between surface water, porewaters, and storage areas (i.e., biofilms, hyporheic zones, and slow surface waters). Comparison of the results to a nearby unrestored stream demonstrate that the restored reach had 10-45 times greater exchange of fine particles with transient storage zones, but 5 times lower rate of net particle immobilization. Local-scale results showed that restoration increased fine particle exchange with short-term storage areas but did not increase long-term particle retention. Thus, the restored stream rapidly exchanged fine sediments with transient storage areas, but did not store fine sediments as efficiently as the unrestored stream. The decreased retention of particulate organic matter in the restored stream may reduce biogeochemical processes, such as denitrification, by not providing sufficient organic carbon or the surface area required for microbial colonization.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000432012500018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLess%2BFine%2BParticle%2BRetention%2Bin%2Ba%2BRestored%2BVersus%2BUnrestored%2BUrban%2BStream%253A%2BBalance%2BBetween%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%252C%2BResuspension%252C%2Band%2BImmobilization%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DDrummond%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2017JG004212%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D1439%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1425-1439%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1425%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D123%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DLarsen%252C%2BLG%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DtJjHXLE3pGk0bUfXoxm&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2017JG004212,,"HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,RESTORATION,TRANSPORT,SEDIMENT,NUTRIENT,ZONE,DYNAMICS,DEPOSITION,MORPHOLOGY",,"CSIC, Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB, Integrat Freshwater Ecol Grp, Blanes, Spain"
