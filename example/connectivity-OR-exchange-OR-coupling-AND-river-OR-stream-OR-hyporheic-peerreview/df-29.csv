The selected membranes have distinct morphologies and electrochemical properties. Differences in the liquid uptake properties of the membranes have been found, which have been analysed on the basis of the structure and the chemical properties of the membranes. In most of the membranes analyzed, the higher the liquid content of the membranes, the lower the effective concentration of fixed charges in the membranes. The streaming potential across the membranes increases linearly with the established pressure difference, and it is larger in heterogeneous membranes than in homogeneous ones. In general, the higher the membrane liquid content, the higher the streaming potential across the membranes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The model proposed is based on depth-averaged Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes equations. The solver is based on the finite volume method on a staggered structured grid and a high-order Monotonic Upwind Scheme for Conservation Laws for convective fluxes. The solution is obtained with a Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations iterative algorithm based on coupled correction of the depth and velocity fields at each time step. The principal innovation of the algorithm proposed is accounting for the variability of the water depth in the source term in the momentum equations. The results show that the approach proposed accurately predicts the flow field and concentration field and demonstrate the significant role of the flow turbulence in transport of pollution in the river stream.Show less,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000528342000004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNUMERICAL%2BMODELLING%2BOF%2BPOLLUTION%2BTRANSPORT%2BIN%2BTOM%2BRIVER%26rft.aufirst%3DV.%2BV.%26rft.auinit%3DVV%26rft.aulast%3DChuruksaeva%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.17223%252F19988621%252F64%252F4%26rft.eissn%3D2311-2255%26rft.epage%3D62%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1998-8621%26rft.issue%3D64%26rft.jtitle%3DVESTNIK%2BTOMSKOGO%2BGOSUDARSTVENNOGO%2BUNIVERSITETA-MATEMATIKA%2BI%2BMEKHANIKA-TOMSK%2BSTATE%2BUNIVERSITY%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMATHEMATICS%2BAND%2BMECHANICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D48-62%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D48%26rft.stitle%3DVESTN%2BTOMSK%2BGOS%2BU-MA%26rft.au%3DChuruksaeva%252C%2BVV%26rft.au%3DStarchenko%252C%2BAV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=VESTNIK+TOMSKOGO+GOSUDARSTVENNOGO+UNIVERSITETA-MATEMATIKA+I+MEKHANIKA-TOMSK+STATE+UNIVERSITY+JOURNAL+OF+MATHEMATICS+AND+MECHANICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The species considered in this study were Crustacea and Oligochaeta and only the more frequently occurring species were included in the analyses. Monthly composition of these species showed a little correlation with physical and chemical parameters. In contrast, when subsets of the monthly samples of the two most abundant species, Microcharon sp. and Diacyclops languidoides, were analyzed, there were strong correlations with at least some of the major physical and chemical parameters (temperature, flow rate, Al, and Fe) in each of the three possible seasonal series. However, correlations between seasonal series were sometimes contradictory and appeared to be artifacts related to sparse data. It is suggested that monthly or more frequent sampling is required for the complete assessment of biodiversity and processes in the hyporheic zone and to study the relationship between the hyporheos and the surface river ecosystem.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000356039300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTemporal%2Bvariability%2Bof%2Bfauna%2Band%2Bthe%2Bimportance%2Bof%2Bsampling%2Bfrequency%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DOana%2BTeodora%26rft.auinit%3DOT%26rft.aulast%3DMoldovan%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-015-2215-3%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D38%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D27-38%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D27%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D755%26rft.au%3DMoldovan%252C%2BOT%26rft.au%3DLevei%252C%2BEA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
3,"Lefebvre, S",Dec 2007 ,N-15-nitrate signature in low-order streams: Effects of land cover and agricultural practices,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Many studies have shown that intensive agricultural practices significantly increase the nitrogen concentration of stream surface waters, but it remains difficult to identify, quantify, and differentiate between terrestrial and in-stream sources or sinks of nitrogen, and rates of transformation. In this study we used the delta N-15-NO3 signature in a watershed dominated by agriculture as an integrating marker to trace (1) the effects of the land cover and agricultural practices on stream-water N concentration in the upstream area of the hydrographic network, (2) influence of the in-stream processes on the NO3-N loads at the reach scale (100 m and 1000 m long), and (3) changes in delta N-15-NO3 signature with increasing stream order (from first to third order). This study suggests that land cover and fertilization practices were the major determinants of delta N-15-NO3 signature in first-order streams. NO3-N loads and delta N-15-NO3 signature increased with fertilization intensity. Small changes in delta N-15-NO3 signature and minor inputs of groundwater were observed along both types of reaches, suggesting the NO3-N load was slightly influenced by in-stream processes. The variability of NO3-N concentrations and delta N-15 signature decreased with increasing stream order, and the delta N-15 signature was positively correlated with watershed areas devoted to crops, supporting a dominant effect of agriculture compared to the effect of in-stream N processing. Consequently, land cover and fertilization practices are integrated in the natural isotopic signal at the third-order stream scale. The GIS analysis of the land cover coupled with natural-abundance isotope signature (delta N-15) represents a potential tool to evaluate the effects of agricultural practices in rural catchments and the consequences of future changes in management policies at the regional scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000251739800017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DN-15-nitrate%2Bsignature%2Bin%2Blow-order%2Bstreams%253A%2BEffects%2Bof%2Bland%2Bcover%2Band%2Bagricultural%2Bpractices%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DLefebvre%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1890%252F06-1496.1%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5582%26rft.epage%3D2346%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1051-0761%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2333-2346%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2333%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DLefebvre%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DClement%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We conducted a series of creative writing workshops in a former industrial area of northern England that were focused on a ""recovering"" river. Participants in the workshops found the process a positive experience and reported changes in their knowledge, attitudes, and actions about the use and management of river environments locally and more generally. The ""catchment consciousness"" of members appeared to increase, and their raised levels of interest led them to invest time in researching the history and geography of the river.

5,"Thouvenot, M",Jul 20 2007 ,Modelling nutrient exchange at the sediment-water interface of river systems,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"In-stream benthic processes can play a significant role on the water quality of overlying waters flowing through a river network. In order to better understand and quantify the fate of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and sitica) during their travel through the river continuum, a deterministic benthic sub-model was developed with the purpose of being connected to a drainage network model. This benthic sub-model resolves the differential equations representing early diagenesis in the sediment, linking the sedimentation rate of organic matter onto the sediment to the resulting flux of nutrients across the sediment-water interface. The model has been developed for conditions where sedimentation prevails as well as for situations where net erosion prevents the built-up of a significant sediment layer and where only a biofilm can develop, attached to solid substrates. The benthic model was tested independently of the main water column biological-hydrological model. to which it is intended to be coupled. For this, three case studies were chosen from the literature representing various sedimentation /erosion conditions: the 8th order river Seine (France), the water storage basin of Mery s/Oise (France), and the headwater stream Orneau (Belgium). The general benthic model has been validated for ammonium, nitrate, oxygen and phosphorus fluxes across the sediment-water interface. The capability of the model to correctly predict the observed nutrients profiles within the sediment was also validated for organic carbon, ammonium and phosphorus. An uncertainty analysis showed that using two modelling objectives (observed fluxes and concentration profiles in the sediment) strongly reduces the uncertainty in parameters calibration. A sensitivity analysis illustrated the complexity of the interacting reactions driving each variable, and justifies the usefulness of the model. as a tool for understanding and predicting the behaviour of the benthic compartment of river systems.

6,"Samuels, R",Sep 15 2009 ,Effect of extreme rainfall events on the water resources of the Jordan River,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"As a response to climate change, shifting rainfall trends including increased multi-year droughts and an escalation in extreme rainfall events are expected in the Middle East. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of these shifting trends on stream flow in the Jordan River and its tributaries. We use a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model to generate artificial daily rainfall simulations which capture independently shifting trends of increased droughts and escalated extreme. These simulations are then used as input into a hydrological model calibrated for the upper catchments of the Jordan River to compare the impact on stream flow and water resources between the different rainfall scenarios. We compare the predicted baseflow and surface flow components of the tested watersheds, and find that while an increase in extreme rainfall events increases the intensity and frequency of surface flow, the over all flow to the Jordan River, and the characteristics of the baseflow in the Jordan River system is not largely impacted. In addition, though it has been suggested that in the case of a multi-year drought the karstic nature of the aquifer might lead to more intense, non-linear reductions in stream flow, here we quantify and show the conditions when annual stream flow reduce linearly with rainfall, and when these relations will become non-linear.

8,"Zhang, WS",Feb 2010 ,A Coupled Water Quantity-Quality Model for Water Allocation Analysis,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"As the demand for water continuously increases with population growth and economic development, the gap between water supply and demand in China has become increasingly wide. In recent years worsening water pollution has caused this gap to become much more serious. Conventional allocation pattern, which mainly considers water quantity as the key factor, is no longer satisfying the water allocation need. A coupled water quantity-quality model in a river basin is presented in this paper to provide a tool for water allocation schemes analysis. The pollutants transport and hydrological cycling processes in a river basin are involved in the model. A river network is divided into different reaches. According to the division of river network, the areas out of the river are divided into a series of tanks. In each tank, hydrologic processes, pollutant loading production, water demand of users and water supply are calculated. In river network, hydrodynamics processes and water quality are simulated. Water quantity and quality exchanges between each tank and river are also considered. The time step of water quality calculation is 24 h, the same with that of water quantity calculation. In each time step period, the connections of river reaches and tanks are realized through the exchange of water quantity and quality between rivers and tanks: pollutants discharge from tanks to rivers and water intake from rivers to satisfy water demand in tanks. The water use in each tank includes three types: domestic, industrial and agricultural water use. Water allocation schemes are one of the input conditions of the model. Using the proposed model, in each tank, water demand and deficit of different uses, in both water quantity and quality, can be obtained under different water allocation schemes. According to the water deficit, water allocation schemes are analyzed to make proper allocation schemes. In this aspect, the proposed model can also be thought as a water allocation model. The model is tested and applied to the Jiaojiang River basin, Zhejiang Province, China, to analyze the different water resource allocation schemes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000274045100005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BCoupled%2BWater%2BQuantity-Quality%2BModel%2Bfor%2BWater%2BAllocation%2BAnalysis%26rft.aufirst%3DWanshun%26rft.auinit%3DWS%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-009-9456-8%26rft.epage%3D511%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D485-511%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D485%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BWS%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BKB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
9,"Lorig, RC",Jun 1 2013 ,"Spatial and temporal distribution of native fish larvae in seasonal and perennial tributaries of the Sacramento River, CA, USA",JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,"Mediterranean climates with their pattern of seasonal rainfall and predictable annual flooding produce a wide variety of seasonally inundated aquatic habitats. Many studies have shown the benefits of these temporary habitats, such as floodplains, for the early life stages of fishes but little work has examined the use of seasonal streams or the differences in the abundance and distribution of native fish larvae between seasonal and perennial stream habitats. We compared the spatial and temporal distribution of fish larvae among two seasonal and two perennial tributaries of the Sacramento River, CA, USA during the winter and spring of 2004 and conducted a detailed examination of the distribution of fish larvae in Mud Creek, a seasonal stream, in 2006 and 2007. In 2004, both seasonal streams had higher average water temperatures (19.0 degrees C and 16.8 degrees C) and an earlier initial appearance of fish larvae (early March) than the perennial streams (15.5 degrees C and 13.3 degrees C; late March and early May). One of the seasonal streams (Mud Creek) yielded significantly higher catch per unit effort (CPUE) of fish larvae (1131 larvae per 10m(3), 95.6% of total CPUE) as well as the highest diversity (0.92 compared to 0.09 or less) and species richness (seven compared to two or fewer) among the four streams sampled. Our detailed study of Mud Creek in 2006 and 2007 yielded a CPUE of 3856 and 18,626 (larvae per 10m(3)), respectively. Samples in Mud Creek for all years yielded five to six native species of Cyprinidae, a family currently recognized as declining in California. Our findings suggest that seasonal streams in the Central Valley are used as spawning and rearing habitat for native fishes. The associated higher water temperatures may induce earlier spawning by adults and the increased temperatures, when coupled with high prey abundances, may increase somatic growth and survival rates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000318775300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Band%2Btemporal%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2Bnative%2Bfish%2Blarvae%2Bin%2Bseasonal%2Band%2Bperennial%2Btributaries%2Bof%2Bthe%2BSacramento%2BRiver%252C%2BCA%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DRebecca%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DRC%26rft.aulast%3DLorig%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F02705060.2012.722065%26rft.eissn%3D2156-6941%26rft.epage%3D197%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0270-5060%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFRESHWATER%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D179-197%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D179%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BFRESHWATER%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DLorig%252C%2BRC%26rft.au%3DMarchetti%252C%2BMP%26rft.au%3DKopp%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+FRESHWATER+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Shuai, P",Apr 2019 ,Dam Operations and Subsurface Hydrogeology Control Dynamics of Hydrologic Exchange Flows in a Regulated River Reach,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) across the river-aquifer interface have important implications for biogeochemical processes and contaminant plume migration in the river corridor, yet little is known about the hydrogeomorphic factors that control HEFs dynamics under dynamic flow conditions. Here, we developed a 3-D numerical model for a large regulated river corridor along the Columbia River to study how HEFs are controlled by the interplays between dam-regulated flow conditions and hydrogeomorphic features of such river corridor system. Our results revealed highly variable intra-annual spatiotemporal patterns in HEFs along the 75-km river reach, as well as strong interannual variability with larger exchange volumes in wet years than dry years. In general, the river was losing during late spring to early summer when the river stage was high, and river was gaining in fall and winter when river stage was low. The magnitude and timing of river stage fluctuations controlled the timing of high exchange rates. Both river channel geomorphology and the thickness of a highly permeable river bank geologic layer controlled the locations of exchange hot spots, while the latter played a dominant role. Dam-induced, subdaily to daily river stage fluctuations drove high-frequency variations in HEFs across the river-aquifer interfaces, resulting in greater overall exchange volumes as compared to the case without high-frequency flows. Our results demonstrated that upstream dam operations enhanced the exchange between river water and groundwater with strong potential influence on the associated biogeochemical processes and on the fate and transport of groundwater contaminant plumes in such river corridors.Plain Language Summary River stage fluctuations due to upstream dam operations enhance water exchange between rivers and aquifers. These exchange flows can stimulate biogeochemical processes in the subsurface. Here, we developed a 3-D numerical model to simulate the flow and transport in a flood plain aquifer within the Hanford Reach, a free-flowing section of Columbia River (WA). Our simulations revealed large spatial and temporal variability in exchange flow magnitude and direction in response to different river flow conditions. Furthermore, river channel morphology and subsurface geology together controlled the locations of high exchange flow rates. Our study provides important insights on the behavior of groundwater contaminant plumes in the river corridors of large regulated river systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000468597900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDam%2BOperations%2Band%2BSubsurface%2BHydrogeology%2BControl%2BDynamics%2Bof%2BHydrologic%2BExchange%2BFlows%2Bin%2Ba%2BRegulated%2BRiver%2BReach%26rft.aufirst%3DPin%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DShuai%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR024193%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2612%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2593-2612%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2593%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DShuai%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BMY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
11,"Mouw, JEB",Oct 2014 ,Spawning tactics of summer chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta in relation to channel complexity and hyporheic exchange,ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,"Vertical hydraulic gradient, channel hydraulic, and substratum data were collected at active chum salmon redds to evaluate their influence on redd site selection in the Kwethluk River, a wandering gravel-bedded tributary of Alaska's Lower Kuskokwim River. Two distinct summer chum salmon spawning tacitcs: primary- and off-channel groups spawning in different hydraulic and thermal environments. Channel hydraulics, ground-surface water exchanges, and bed sediment data were collected throughout the range of topographic conditions at sites occupied and unoccupied by spawners. Analyses of these data showed that redd site selection was incoherent with channel hydraulics and substratum size, when all channel types were considered. Rather, spawning was associated with the exchange of river and groundwater at four spatial scales. In primary channels, chum salmon spawned only in reaches where the regional hydraulic gradient (regional scale) promoted the penetration of river water, or downwelling, into the bed sediments. Within these reaches, primary-channel spawning was influenced by bed topography (fluvial scale) that promoted strong localized downwelling; a logit model, fitted to constituent hydraulics, discriminated between selected and unselected sites with 89 % accuracy. In contrast, spawners in off-channel habitats (flood and spring channels) selected areas of upwelling groundwater, regardless of channel hydraulics and the regional hydraulic gradient. In parafluvial flood channels, spawners selected localized upwelling associated with short groundwater flow paths (parafluvial scale). In spring channels, within the floodplain's forested riparia (orthofluvial scale), spawners eschewed areas of localized downwelling and uniformly selected upwelling zones feeding these channels. Thus, redd selectivity differentiated two spawning tactics (groups) in this complex channel network where ground and surface water exchange is an important predictor of spawning habitat.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000341496600002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpawning%2Btactics%2Bof%2Bsummer%2Bchum%2Bsalmon%2BOncorhynchus%2Bketa%2Bin%2Brelation%2Bto%2Bchannel%2Bcomplexity%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DJason%2BE.%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DJEB%26rft.aulast%3DMouw%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10641-013-0200-0%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5133%26rft.epage%3D1107%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0378-1909%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BBIOLOGY%2BOF%2BFISHES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1095-1107%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1095%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BBIOL%2BFISH%26rft.volume%3D97%26rft.au%3DMouw%252C%2BJEB%26rft.au%3DTappenbeck%252C%2BTH%26rft.au%3DStanford%252C%2BJA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+BIOLOGY+OF+FISHES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
12,"Chen, J",Apr 2019 ,Numerical Investigation of Fresh and Salt Water Distribution in the Pearl River Estuary during a Typhoon Using a Fully Coupled Atmosphere-Wave-Ocean Model,WATER,"Typhoons are major marine dynamic disasters that affect the coastal ocean areas of China. During a typhoon, the coupling dynamic factors, such as wind, waves, storm surges, and river runoff, greatly enhance the mass and energy exchange at the various interfaces of the ocean. A fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean model in the South China Sea (SCS) was established based on the WRF, SWAN, and ROMS models. The variation of sea surface salinity (SSS) and ocean subsurface salinity caused by Typhoon Kai-tak (201213) was analyzed by the fully coupled model, and the basic characteristics of the response of the upper ocean to the typhoon are given in this paper. The simulation results demonstrate that the salinity of the sea surface showed a sharp change during Typhoon Kai-tak, and it changed gradually after entering the recovery period. During the passage of Typhoon Kai-tak, the disturbance caused by strong winds strengthened the mixing process of the water in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and its adjacent waters. As the typhoon developed, under the influence of Ekman pumping, the mixing effect between the subsurface and the bottom and the upper water was obvious. Before the impact of Typhoon Kai-tak, the salinity had obvious stratification characteristics along the water depth. Due to the influence of the storm surge, the surface water with increased salinity was transported to the estuary, which led to an increase in the salinity of the estuary's surface water. In this condition, it is highly likely for there to be saltwater intrusion. The salinity distribution characteristics of three schemes (ROMS model only, coupled WRF-ROMS model, and fully coupled WRF-SWAN-ROMS model) were compared in this study. In the fully coupled WRF-SWAN-ROMS model, the disturbance of the bottom water was the most obvious, and the salinity value was greater than that of the coupled WRF-ROMS model, which indicates that under the influence of waves, the mixing and exchange abilities were strengthened.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000473105700016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B646%26rft.atitle%3DNumerical%2BInvestigation%2Bof%2BFresh%2Band%2BSalt%2BWater%2BDistribution%2Bin%2Bthe%2BPearl%2BRiver%2BEstuary%2Bduring%2Ba%2BTyphoon%2BUsing%2Ba%2BFully%2BCoupled%2BAtmosphere-Wave-Ocean%2BModel%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw11040646%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2073-4441%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BCB%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BXJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"Hiester, J",Feb 2016 ,Topographically mediated ice stream subglacial drainage networks,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE,"Satellite laser altimetry reveals short timescale changes in Antarctic ice sheet surface elevation that are suggested to be driven by subglacial water transport and storage. Here details of the interaction between the dynamics of ice stream flow, subglacial water system, and bed elevation relief are examined in the context of idealized, heterogeneous bed geometries. Using a two-way coupled model of ice and subglacial water flow, we show that basal topography controls the temporal and spatial variability of the sub-ice stream hydraulic system. The orientation and characteristic dimensions of the topographic undulations determine the morphology (connected subglacial ponds or channel-like subglacial water features) and timescales of the sub-ice stream drainage system. The short-term (several years to decades) variability of the simulated coupled ice stream/subglacial water system suggests that the short-term surface variations detected in remote sensing observations may be indicative of a rapidly evolving subglacial water system. Our simulations also show that interaction between ice flow and the highly dynamic subglacial water system has a strong effect on effective stress in the ice. Large effective stress magnitudes arise over areas where the basal traction is characterized by strong spatial gradients, that is, transitions from high to low basal traction or vise versa. These transitions migrate on multiyear timescales and thus cause large effective stress variability on the same temporal scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000372928400016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTopographically%2Bmediated%2Bice%2Bstream%2Bsubglacial%2Bdrainage%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DHiester%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015JF003660%26rft.eissn%3D2169-9011%26rft.epage%3D510%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9003%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-EARTH%2BSURFACE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D497-510%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D497%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-EARTH%26rft.volume%3D121%26rft.au%3DHiester%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DSergienko%252C%2BOV%26rft.au%3DHulbe%252C%2BCL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-EARTH+SURFACE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
14,"Batzer, DP",Feb 2018 ,A Floodplain Continuum for Atlantic Coast Rivers of the Southeastern US: Predictable Changes in Floodplain Biota along a River's Length,WETLANDS,"Floodplains are among the world's economically-most-valuable, environmentally-most-threatened, and yet conceptually-least-understood ecosystems. Drawing on concepts from existing riverine and wetland models, and empirical data from floodplains of Atlantic Coast rivers in the Southeastern US (and elsewhere when possible), we introduce a conceptual model to explain a continuum of longitudinal variation in floodplain ecosystem functions with a particular focus on biotic change. Our hypothesis maintains that major controls on floodplain ecology are either external (ecotonal interactions with uplands or stream/river channels) or internal (wetland-specific functions), and the relative importance of these controls changes progressively from headwater to mid-river to lower-river floodplains. Inputs of water, sediments, nutrients, flora, and fauna from uplands-to-floodplains decrease, while the impacts of wetland biogeochemistry and obligate wetland plants and animals within-floodplains increase, along the length of a river floodplain. Inputs of water, sediment, nutrients, and fauna from river/stream channels to floodplains are greatest mid-river, and lower either up- or down-stream. While the floodplain continuum we develop is regional in scope, we review how aspects may apply more broadly. Management of coupled floodplain-river ecosystems would be improved by accounting for how factors controlling the floodplain ecosystem progressively change along longitudinal riverine gradients.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000425634800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BFloodplain%2BContinuum%2Bfor%2BAtlantic%2BCoast%2BRivers%2Bof%2Bthe%2BSoutheastern%2BUS%253A%2BPredictable%2BChanges%2Bin%2BFloodplain%2BBiota%2Balong%2Ba%2BRiver%2527s%2BLength%26rft.aufirst%3DDarold%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DDP%26rft.aulast%3DBatzer%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs13157-017-0983-4%26rft.eissn%3D1943-6246%26rft.epage%3D13%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0277-5212%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWETLANDS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1-13%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1%26rft.stitle%3DWETLANDS%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DBatzer%252C%2BDP%26rft.au%3DNoe%252C%2BGB%26rft.au%3DGalatowitsch%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=WETLANDS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
15,"MacDonald, RJ",Apr 16 2014 ,A process-based stream temperature modelling approach for mountain regions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Mountain streams have thermal regimes that provide critical habitat for native aquatic organisms. However, understanding stream temperature response to environmental change in mountain regions is difficult because there is typically a lack of observations. This work aims to address this issue by coupling two process-based models to simulate stream temperature in a groundwater-dominated mountain catchment, Alberta, Canada, and using a reach-scale field study for model development and verification. Results suggest that it is possible to produce spatial simulations of hydrometeorological variables needed for process-based stream temperature modelling. Simulated stream energy budget estimates compare well with results from field-based studies, and errors in stream temperature simulations (RMSE < 1.6) are similar to other modelling studies, providing confidence in the methods developed. Model sensitivity analysis demonstrates the importance of incorporating meteorological, hydrological, and geomorphological controls on stream temperature in modelling studies. This study also demonstrates the current lack of process knowledge regarding in-stream ice cover and snowmelt effects on stream temperature, both of which can contribute substantially to stream thermal regimes.

16,"Golden, LA",Aug 15 2006 ,"Channel geometry, median grain size, and stream power in small mountain streams",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Small mountain streams are typically affected by the same variables as larger counterparts, but small headwater channels are also coupled with hillslopes. The added degree of system complexity limits extension of existing conceptual and quantitative models of stream response to small mountain streams. Our objective is to determine how the presence of multiple lithologies on channel beds and coarse sediments affect relationships between channel geometry and driving and resisting variables in small mountain streams when the variables are examined at the landscape-scale. We test for systematic scaling of channel geometry, stream power indices, and median bed grain size (D-50) in headwater streams draining < 10 km(2) and overlying multiple strata on a passive continental margin. Field data were collected from 157 reaches in 32 watersheds. Local strata can be divided into a thick sequence of resistant sandstones and a thick sequence of low resistance, calcareous siltstones and shales with interbedded limestones. Both stratigraphic units are present in every watershed and all streams carry abundant, coarse bed load derived from the resistant unit. Mean widths and gradients of the channels are correlated with upstream drainage area. Unit stream power is not statistically different as a function of rock unit, but channel gradients are lower atop the low resistance unit. D-50 is not correlated with drainage area, but is positively correlated with unit stream power. The correlation between unit stream power and D-50 is evidence for mutual adjustments among gradients, widths, and D-50 as a function of the primary driving force in the drainage area, discharge. The small effect of bed lithology on stream processes and strong relationship between channel geometry, unit stream power, and D-50 implies that available driving forces and grain size are the primary controls on stream processes in the study area. We conclude that future research into system response in this and similar settings should focus on sediment characteristics, production, and flux.

17,"Choi, J",Jun 2000 ,Characterizing multiple timescales of stream and storage zone interaction that affect solute fate and transport in streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The fate of contaminants in streams and rivers is affected by exchange and biogeochemical transformation in slowly moving or stagnant flow zones that interact with rapid flow in the main channel. In a typical stream, there are multiple types of slowly moving flow zones in which exchange and transformation occur, such as stagnant or recirculating surface water as well as subsurface hyporheic zones. However, most investigators use transport models with just a single storage zone in their modeling studies, which assumes that the effects of multiple storage zones can be lumped together. Our study addressed the following question: Can a single-storage zone model reliably characterize the effects of physical retention and biogeochemical reactions in multiple storage zones? We extended an existing stream transport model with a single storage zone to include a second storage zone. With the extended model we generated 500 data sets representing transport of nonreactive and reactive solutes in stream systems that have two different types of storage zones with variable hydrologic conditions. The one storage zone model was tested by optimizing the lumped storage parameters to achieve a best fit for each of the generated data sets. Multiple storage processes were categorized as possessing I, additive; II, competitive; or III, dominant storage zone characteristics. The classification was based on the goodness of fit of generated data sets, the degree of similarity in mean retention time of the two storage zones, and the relative distributions of exchange flux and storage capacity between the two storage zones. For most cases (>90%) the one storage zone model described either the effect of the sum of multiple storage processes (category I) or the dominant storage process (category III). Failure of the one storage zone model occurred mainly for category II, that is, when one of the storage zones had a much longer mean retention time (t(s) ratio > 5.0) and when the dominance of storage capacity and exchange flux occurred in different storage zones. We also used the one storage zone model to estimate a ""single"" lumped rate constant representing the net removal of a solute by biogeochemical reactions in multiple storage zones. For most cases the lumped rate constant that was optimized by one storage zone modeling estimated the flux-weighted rate constant for multiple storage zones. Our results explain how the relative hydrologic properties of multiple storage zones (retention time, storage capacity, exchange flux, and biogeochemical reaction rate constant) affect the reliability of lumped parameters determined by a one storage zone transport model. We conclude that stream transport models with a single storage compartment will in most cases reliably characterize the dominant physical processes of solute retention and biogeochemical reactions in streams with multiple storage zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000087226800013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCharacterizing%2Bmultiple%2Btimescales%2Bof%2Bstream%2Band%2Bstorage%2Bzone%2Binteraction%2Bthat%2Baffect%2Bsolute%2Bfate%2Band%2Btransport%2Bin%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJ%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DChoi%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2000WR900051%26rft.epage%3D1518%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1511-1518%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1511%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DChoi%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DConklin%252C%2BMH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
18,"Cardenas, MB",Mar 2007 ,Hydrodynamics of coupled flow above and below a sediment-water interface with triangular bedforms,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The hydrodynamics of a system where there is a coupled flow above and below a sediment-water interface (SWI) are not completely understood. We numerically simulate mean two-dimensional, unidirectional, steady, viscous flow in these systems using a sequentially coupled formulation. Simulations were conducted to determine fundamental relationships between bedform geometry, Reynolds number for the water-column flow (Re), interfacial exchange zone depth (d(2)) in the sediments, and flux through the SWI (q(int)); the latter two parameters play a significant role in biogeochemical and aquatic-life processes across the SWI. d(z) and Re are functionally related through an asymptotic growth-curve model while q(int) and Re follow a power function. These relationships are dynamically explained by the manner in which pressure gradients along the SWI develop due to current-bedform interactions at different Res and by Darcy's Law. We found that the coupling between water column and exchange zone flow is controlled by the behavior of the water-column eddy. The eddy detaches at or near the point of minimum pressure along the interface, and reattaches near the point of maximum pressure. These two critical points determine the pressure gradient along the bed surface that controls the exchange zone flow field. Moreover, the reattachment point corresponds to flow divides within the sediments. Lastly, pore-water velocities drop with depth below the SWI, and are larger below the bedform crests than below the troughs. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The water discharge diverting from the Yangtze River to the Dongting Lake has recently decreased considerably in China However, their variation characteristics and major driving factors remained unclear. In this study, Mann Kendall trend and Pettitt abrupt tests were employed to determine the changes of time series. Double mass curve analysis and regression analysis were used for the qualitative analysis of the impacts of climate change and human activity. Results revealed that precipitation change trends significantly decreased in autumn. The water discharge at the trunk Yangtze River had a decreasing trend in autumn and an increasing trend in winter. The annual and seasonal water discharge diverting from the Yangtze River to the Dongting Lake, except at Xinjiangkou in summer, exhibited significant downward trends. No consistent trends in precipitation and water discharge were identified, thereby indicating that the seasonal relationships between them had been disturbed by human activities. Human activities had a dominant effect on the water discharge exchange between them during 1967-2018. Along with the intensification of human activities, the hydrological connectivity between the Yangtze River and the Dongting Lake would probably be further changed in the near future.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000530720800074,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCHANGE%2BCHARACTERISTICS%2BOF%2BWATER%2BEXCHANGE%2BBETWEEN%2BTHE%2BYANGTZE%2BRIVER%2BAND%2BTHE%2BDONGTING%2BLAKE%2BDURING%2B1960-2018%2BIN%2BCHINA%26rft.aufirst%3DY.%2BY.%26rft.auinit%3DYY%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.15666%252Faeer%252F1802_31773193%26rft.eissn%3D1785-0037%26rft.epage%3D3193%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1589-1623%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BECOLOGY%2BAND%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3177-3193%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3177%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BECOL%2BENV%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BYY%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BGS%26rft.au%3DLai%252C%2BXJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+ECOLOGY+AND+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Beyazit, EA",Mar 10 2016 ,On stream selection for interference alignment in heterogeneous networks,EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING,"This paper proposes a stream selection algorithm to deal with the interference and increase the sum capacity in the context of heterogeneous networks where cells of different types coexist. Due to the different transmit powers between the macro and small cells, interference levels are also different. Since the small cells are densely deployed, fully connected interference network between small cells is considered in this paper. The proposed algorithm performs the selection of a stream sequence among a predetermined set of sequences. Those selected sequences are the ones that mostly contribute to the sum rate when performing the exhaustive search. As a consequence, since the search space is reduced, the complexity is significantly decreased. These stream sequences form a regular structure where the first stream is associated to a pico user. Another distinguishing property of the proposed approach is that the stream sequences include at least one stream for each user. When selecting the streams, the channel matrices of the unselected streams are projected orthogonally to the virtual transmit and virtual receive channels of the selected stream in order to align the interference in the null space of these virtual channels. The performance evaluations are carried out by considering different scenarios with different numbers and locations of pico cells. It is shown that the proposed method can significantly reduce the computational complexity while achieving a very close performance to the exhaustive search.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000372287600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B80%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2Bstream%2Bselection%2Bfor%2Binterference%2Balignment%2Bin%2Bheterogeneous%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DEsra%2BAycan%26rft.auinit%3DEA%26rft.aulast%3DBeyazit%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1186%252Fs13638-016-0575-7%26rft.eissn%3D1687-1499%26rft.epage%3D18%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1687-1472%26rft.jtitle%3DEURASIP%2BJOURNAL%2BON%2BWIRELESS%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%2BAND%2BNETWORKING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1-18%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1%26rft.stitle%3DEURASIP%2BJ%2BWIREL%2BCOMM%26rft.au%3DBeyazit%252C%2BEA%26rft.au%3DOzbek%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DLe%2BRuyet%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=EURASIP+JOURNAL+ON+WIRELESS+COMMUNICATIONS+AND+NETWORKING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Baskaran, S",2009 ,Investigating groundwater-river interactions using environmental tracers,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES,"Groundwater and surface water are hydraulically connected in many landscapes, and a better understanding of their connectivity is critical for effective management of water resources. Environmental tracers are a useful preliminary tool to study the interaction between groundwater and surface water and provide independent means for corroborating or refuting information based on more traditional investigations. This paper discusses the results of using major ions, stable isotopes (deuterium and oxygen-18) and a radioactive isotope (radon-222) as environmental tracers to better understand groundwater-surface water interactions in the Border Rivers catchment, Australia. In the upstream reaches of the catchment, shallow groundwater close to the river has a similar major-ion and stable-isotope chemistry to that of the river water, and is different to the groundwater distant from the river. The near-stream groundwater has an enriched isotopic signature (less negative) whereas groundwater far from the river has a depleted isotopic signature. Overall, the comparison of chloride concentrations with deuterium suggests that three types of groundwater occur in the Border Rivers catchment: (i) the near-stream groundwaters influenced by direct recharge from the river; (ii) the groundwaters marginal to the river that are more influenced by diffuse rainfall recharge; and(iii) saline groundwaters in the downstream part of the catchment which never (or rarely) receive recharge from surface water. River water samples obtained during the high-flow season show a very low variation in radon concentrations (0.11-0.39 Bq/L). The longitudinal transect of radon concentration measurements in river water during the high-flow season indicates that there is no groundwater contribution to stream flow. Radon concentrations are lower in groundwater close to the rivers and increase with distance from the river, in general coincidence with the salinity and chloride concentration. This indicates river water infiltration into nearby alluvial aquifers, rather than groundwater discharge to the river. The results of hydrochemical and environmental isotope sampling indicate that in the upper catchment area (upstream of Keetah) the river is connected to and actively recharges the near-stream shallow alluvial aquifer. Using the environmental isotope data, we have also demonstrated that recharge of the alluvial aquifers by surface water occurs by bank infiltration, with diffuse recharge during high-rainfall events more dominant further away from the river. This information would be useful for a better understanding of the nature and extent of hydrogeological processes at the river-aquifer interface and their links with biogeochemical processes and ultimately water allocation policies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000263642100003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInvestigating%2Bgroundwater-river%2Binteractions%2Busing%2Benvironmental%2Btracers%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DBaskaran%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F08120090802541887%26rft.epage%3D19%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0812-0099%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAUSTRALIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D13-19%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D13%26rft.stitle%3DAUST%2BJ%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DBaskaran%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DRansley%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DBaker%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=AUSTRALIAN+JOURNAL+OF+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Da Lozzo, G",Dec 24 2019 ,Planarity of streamed graphs,THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE,"In this paper we introduce a notion of planarity for graphs that are presented in a streaming fashion. A streamed graph is a stream of edges e(1), e(2), ..., e(m) on a vertex set V. A streamed graph is omega-stream planar with respect to a positive integer window size omega if there exists a sequence of planar topological drawings Gamma(i) of the graphs G(i) = (V, {e(j) vertical bar i <= j < i + omega}) such that the common graph G(boolean AND)(i) = G(i) boolean AND G(i+1) is drawn the same in Gamma(i) and in Gamma(i +1), for 1 <= i <= m - omega. The STREAM PLANARITY Problem with window size omega asks whether a given streamed graph is omega-stream planar. We also consider a generalization, where there is an additional backbone graph whose edges have to be present during each time step. These problems are related to several well-studied planarity problems.We show that the STREAM PLANARITY Problem is NP-complete even when the window size is a constant and that the variant with a backbone graph is NP-complete for all omega >= 2. On the positive side, we provide O(n + omega m)-time algorithms for (i) the case omega = 1 and (ii) all values of omega provided the backbone graph is 2-connected.

23,"Wang, JW",,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressure and emission from the river-reservoir system in the upper Yellow River, northwest China",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"The exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) flux between rivers and the atmosphere is an important part of the global carbon cycle. Reservoir development and environmental changes gradually transform rivers into river-reservoir systems. However, the current estimates of CO2 exchange flux at the water-air interface in river-reservoir systems, especially in ecologically fragile regions, are still largely uncertain. In this study, the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and exchange flux (FCO2) from river-reservoir systems in the upper reaches of the Yellow River (YeUR) were investigated using the CO2 SYS system and a boundary layer approach. The spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of the partial pressure of rho CO2 and FCO2 were revealed. Our results demonstrated that, driven by the freeze-thaw cycle of the permafrost active layer and the development of cascade reservoirs, the average rho CO2 in the two water periods was higher in the cascade reservoir section (CR) than in the source region section (SR) and higher in the flood period than in the dry period. Driven by water temperature stratification and light conditions, the rho CO2 of each reservoir in the CR exhibited seasonal variations along with water depth. The environmental factors TN, TP, T, DO, and DOC were the main influencing factors of rho CO2 distribution and could be used as predictors of rho CO2 in the dry period (R-2 =0.40 P < 0.01). In the dry period, the FCO2 in the SR was - 112.91 +/- 165.94 mmol/ (m(2).d), which was a sink of CO2, and the FCO2 in the CR was 131.02 +/- 156.77 mmol/(m(2).d), which was a source of CO2. In the flood period, the FCO2 in the SR was 686.54 +/- 624.33 mmol/(m(2).d), and the FCO2 in the CR was 466.10 +/- 366.67 mmol/(m(2).d). Both the SR and the CR were sinks of CO2. Our results contribute to the understanding of CO2 exchange in river-reservoir systems and carbon cycle processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000874061400008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCarbon%2Bdioxide%2B%2528CO2%2529%2Bpartial%2Bpressure%2Band%2Bemission%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Briver-reservoir%2Bsystem%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bupper%2BYellow%2BRiver%252C%2Bnorthwest%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DJiawei%26rft.auinit%3DJW%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-022-23489-5%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BJY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
24,"Ghysels, G",Aug 2019 ,"A modified approach for modelling river-aquifer interaction of gaining rivers in MODFLOW, including riverbed heterogeneity and river bank seepage",HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"There is a need for groundwater modelling approaches that can incorporate both the complexity of riverbeds and the influence of lateral flows through the river banks in the simulation of river-aquifer interaction. A simple and straight-forward approach is proposed for modelling river-aquifer interaction in gaining rivers based on existing building blocks available in MODFLOW. The river water itself is modelled as constant-head cells, while the riverbed is modelled as one or more separate layers. The Horizontal Flow Barrier (HFB) Package is used to simulate the effect of a river bank on lateral exchange fluxes between river and aquifer. This approach has several advantages over conventional MODFLOW streamflow packages: (1) riverbeds can be modelled as several layers with different hydraulic properties; (2) both vertical and horizontal flow through the riverbed can be modelled; and (3) lateral flow through the river banks can be simulated. The capabilities of the new approach are demonstrated in two applications based on a MODFLOW model of the Aa River, Belgium. Application I demonstrates that the approach can be used to model heterogeneous multi-layered riverbeds. Results show that neglecting this heterogeneity can result in an overestimation of river-aquifer exchange fluxes. Application II shows that the approach can be used to simulate the effect of lateral fluxes through river banks. It demonstrates that lateral fluxes can be a major contributor to total river-aquifer exchange fluxes. The proposed approach provides the necessary tools to accurately model river-aquifer interaction for gaining rivers in MODFLOW.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000475982700023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmodified%2Bapproach%2Bfor%2Bmodelling%2Briver-aquifer%2Binteraction%2Bof%2Bgaining%2Brivers%2Bin%2BMODFLOW%252C%2Bincluding%2Briverbed%2Bheterogeneity%2Band%2Briver%2Bbank%2Bseepage%26rft.aufirst%3DGert%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DGhysels%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-019-01941-0%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D1863%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1851-1863%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1851%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DGhysels%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DMutua%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DHuysmans%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The experimental results indicate that 0.01 M NaF solution was found the most suitable for removal of plutonium. The mixture of Na2CO3 and sodium salt of EDTA solution was found to be better for decontamination of spent ion exchange resin from beta and gamma activities. Optimized mixture of 0.5 M Na2CO3 and 0.1 M sodium salt of EDTA solution was found to be the most effective for fission product activities removal.

27,"Berube, M",2018 ,"The fate of arsenic in groundwater discharged to the Meghna River, Bangladesh",ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY,"Environmental contextArsenic contamination of groundwater is a major environmental problem in many areas of the world. In south-east Asia, iron-rich reducing groundwater mixes with oxidising river water in hyporheic zones, precipitating iron oxides. These oxides can act as a natural reactive barrier capable of accumulating elevated solid-phase concentrations of arsenic. AbstractShallow, anoxic aquifers within the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta (GBMD) commonly contain elevated concentrations of arsenic (As), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). Highly enriched solid-phase concentrations of these elements have been observed within sediments lining the banks of the Meghna River. This zone has been described as a Natural Reactive Barrier (NRB). The impact of hydrological processes on NRB formation, such as transient river levels, which drive mixing between rivers and aquifers, is poorly understood. We evaluated the impact of groundwater flow dynamics on hydrobiogeochemical processes that led to the formation of an Fe- and Mn-rich NRB containing enriched As, within a riverbank aquifer along the Meghna River. The NRB dimensions were mapped using four complementary elemental analysis methods on sediment cores: X-ray fluorescence (XRF), aqua regia bulk extraction, and HCl and sodium phosphate leaching. It extended from 1.2 to 2.4m in depth up to 15m from the river's edge. The accumulated As was advected to the NRB from offsite and released locally in response to mixing with aged river water. Nearly all of the As was subsequently deposited within the NRB before discharging to the Meghna. Significant Fe-II release to the aqueous phase was observed within the NRB. This indicates the NRB is a dynamic zone defined by the interplay between oxidative and reductive processes, causing the NRB to grow and recede in response to rapid and seasonal hydrologic processes. This implies that natural and artificially induced changes in river stages and groundwater-tables will impact where As accumulates and is released to aquifers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000433340000004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bfate%2Bof%2Barsenic%2Bin%2Bgroundwater%2Bdischarged%2Bto%2Bthe%2BMeghna%2BRiver%252C%2BBangladesh%26rft.aufirst%3DMichelle%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DBerube%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FEN17104%26rft.eissn%3D1449-8979%26rft.epage%3D45%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1448-2517%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D29-45%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D29%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BCHEM%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DBerube%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DJewell%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DDatta%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+CHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
28,"Recking, A",Nov 15 2012 ,Influence of sediment supply on mountain streams bedload transport,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Sediment transport and storage in mountain stream channels are closely dependent on hillslope activities and bank erosion. This paper analyses bedload measured in 13 mountain streams (989 values with slope higher than 5%) in an attempt to investigate how much the sediment supply condition impacts bedload transport rates. First, the sediment supply condition of each stream was evaluated qualitatively using information available in the original studies. In the second step, the data set was analysed by comparing bedload transport rates considering a Shields stress ratio and by comparing transport rate efficiency with consideration of a dimensionless stream power. The two analyses indicate higher sediment transport rates for the streams identified as ""connected"" to an active source. The consequences for bedload transport prediction are discussed with a nonthreshold bedload equation. Even though predicting the exact sediment supply condition and the associated transport rate is not yet possible, this study suggests that defining an envelope delimiting minimum and maximum transport for a given river reach should be possible.

We apply a fully-coupled process model to investigate how the response of an ice stream to increased ocean temperature beneath its ice shelf depends on the assumed form of its basal flow law. For the same applied oceanic warming, the increase in grounding-line flux can be twice as great for an effectively-plastic bed as for a linear-viscous bed, suggesting that improved knowledge of the basal flow law of ice streams is necessary for predicting ice-sheet response to climatic forcing.

30,"Han, GX",Oct 15 2014 ,Agricultural reclamation effects on ecosystem CO2 exchange of a coastal wetland in the Yellow River Delta,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,"Little is known about the impacts of agricultural exploitation of coastal wetlands on ecosystem CO2 exchange, although coastal wetlands have been widely reclaimed for agricultural use across the world. We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its major components, gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) using an eddy covariance flux technique in a natural coastal wetland (reed) and an adjacent, newly reclaimed farmland (cotton) in the Yellow River Delta, China. The results showed that agricultural reclamation changed the ecosystem CO2 exchange of the coastal wetland at three distinct levels. Initially, the conversion from the wetland to farmland changed the light response parameters (alpha, A(max), and R-eco, day) of NEE and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of R-eco mainly by changing the dominant vegetation type. Over the growing season, NEE, R-eco and GPP were significantly correlated with LAI at both sites and aboveground biomass at the farmland site. Next, the reclamation of wetland modified the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of ecosystem CO2 exchange. Significant differences in diurnal variations of NEE between the wetland and farmland sites were found during the growing season (with the exception of June and July). Seasonal means of daily GPP and R-eco values at the wetland site were higher than those at the farmland. Ultimately, the agricultural reclamation altered the CO2 sequestration capacity of the coastal wetland. The cumulative NEE in the wetland (-237.4 g Cm-2) was higher than that in the farmland (-202.0 g Cm-2). When biomass removal was taken into account, the farmland was a strong source for CO2 of around 131.9 g Cm-2 during the growing season.

All systems were consistently supersaturated in CO2 (range 450 to 5000 mu atm) streams having both higher (mean 1850 mu atm) and more variable pCO(2) than that of rivers (range 550 to 800 matm). Stream pCO(2) was positively related to DOC concentration and stream segment length, both suggesting a direct influence of the surrounding landscape. Calculated stream water-air CO2 fluxes ranged from 700 to over 3000 mg C m(-2) d(-1), up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those measured in large rivers and lakes of the same region. Small streams, despite their extremely reduced areal coverage (1% of the aquatic surface), accounted for 25% of the total aquatic C emissions, and the resulting areal stream fluxes were comparable to those measured in different soils or wetlands in the region.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000265929500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BGB2012%26rft.atitle%3DPatterns%2Bin%2BpCO%25282%2529%2Bin%2Bboreal%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%2Bof%2Bnorthern%2BQuebec%252C%2BCanada%26rft.aufirst%3DCristian%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DCR%26rft.aulast%3DTeodoru%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008GB003404%26rft.eissn%3D1944-9224%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0886-6236%26rft.jtitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEMICAL%2BCYCLES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEM%2BCY%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DTeodoru%252C%2BCR%26rft.au%3DDel%2BGiorgio%252C%2BPA%26rft.au%3DCamire%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=GLOBAL+BIOGEOCHEMICAL+CYCLES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
32,"Baker, MA",Feb 2004 ,"Hydrological variability, organic matter supply and denitrification in the Garonne River ecosystem",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Groundwater nitrate contamination has become a worldwide problem as increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilisers are used in agriculture. Alluvial groundwater is uniquely juxtaposed between soils and streams. Hydrological connections among these subsystems regulate nutrient cycling.2. We measured denitrification using an in situ acetylene-block assay in a nitrate-contaminated portion of the Garonne River catchment along a gradient of surface water-ground water mixing during high (snowmelt) and low flow.3. During high flow (mid-April to early June) the water table rose an average of 35 cm and river water penetrated the subsurface to a great extent in monitoring wells. Denitrification rates averaged 5.40 mugN(2)O L-1 min(-1) during the high flow period, nearly double the average rate (2.91 mugN(2)O L-1 min(-1)) measured during base flow. This was driven by a strong increase in denitrification in groundwater under native riparian vegetation. Nitrate concentrations were significantly lower during high flow compared with base flow. Riparian patches had higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations that were more aromatic compared with the gravel bar patch closest to the river.4. Multiple linear regression showed that the rate of denitrification was best predicted by the concentration of low molecular weight organic acids. These molecules are probably derived from decomposition of soil organic matter and are an important energy source for anaerobic respiratory processes like denitrification. The second best predictor was per cent surface water, reflecting higher denitrification rates during spring when hydrological connection between surface water and ground water was greatest.5. Our results indicate that, while denitrification rates in Garonne River alluvium were spatially and temporally variable, denitrification was a significant NO3 sink during transport from the NO3-contaminated floodplain to the river. DOC availability and river-floodplain connectivity were important factors influencing observed spatial and temporal patterns.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000188224600005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrological%2Bvariability%252C%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bsupply%2Band%2Bdenitrification%2Bin%2Bthe%2BGaronne%2BRiver%2Becosystem%26rft.aufirst%3DMA%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DBaker%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2426.2003.01175.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D190%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D181-190%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D181%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DBaker%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DVervier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
33,"Zarnetske, JP",Jul 11 2007 ,"Transient storage as a function of geomorphology, discharge, and permafrost active layer conditions in Arctic tundra streams",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Transient storage of solutes in hyporheic zones or other slow- moving stream waters plays an important role in the biogeochemical processes of streams. While numerous studies have reported a wide range of parameter values from simulations of transient storage, little field work has been done to investigate the correlations between these parameters and shifts in surface and subsurface flow conditions. In this investigation we use the stream properties of the Arctic (namely, highly varied discharges, channel morphologies, and subchannel permafrost conditions) to isolate the effects of discharge, channel morphology, and potential size of the hyporheic zone on transient storage. We repeated stream tracer experiments in five morphologically diverse tundra streams in Arctic Alaska during the thaw season (May - August) of 2004 to assess transient storage and hydrologic characteristics. We compared transient storage model parameters to discharge (Q), the Darcy- Weisbach friction factor (f), and unit stream power (w). Across all studied streams, permafrost active layer depths (i. e., the potential extent of the hyporheic zone) increased throughout the thaw season, and discharges and velocities varied dramatically with minimum ranges of eight- fold and four- fold, respectively. In all reaches the mean storage residence time (t(stor)) decreased exponentially with increasing Q, but did not clearly relate to permafrost active layer depths. Furthermore, we found that modeled transient storage metrics (i. e., t(stor), storage zone exchange rate (alpha(OTIS)), and hydraulic retention (R-h)) correlated better with channel hydraulic descriptors such as f and w than they did with Q or channel slope. Our results indicate that Q is the first- order control on transient storage dynamics of these streams, and that f and w are two relatively simple measures of channel hydraulics that may be important metrics for predicting the response of transient storage to perturbations in discharge and morphology in a given stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000248039600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW07410%26rft.atitle%3DTransient%2Bstorage%2Bas%2Ba%2Bfunction%2Bof%2Bgeomorphology%252C%2Bdischarge%252C%2Band%2Bpermafrost%2Bactive%2Blayer%2Bconditions%2Bin%2BArctic%2Btundra%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJay%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DZarnetske%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2005WR004816%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DBowden%252C%2BWB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
34,"Meredith, W",Jun 21 2021 ,Hydromorphologic Control of Streambed Fine Particle Standing Stocks Influences In-stream Aerobic Respiration,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) accumulated in streambeds is a major component of organic matter budgets in headwater streams and greatly affects productivity and metabolism of stream communities. The spatiotemporal distribution of benthic FPOM in the stream, as well as its quantity and quality, depend on inputs from different source types. These can be natural such as soils, streambanks and riparian vegetation, or anthropogenic such as effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In addition, stream flow is a key driver of FPOM dynamics, which influences the balance between its transport and accumulation in the streambed. Yet, the link between FPOM dynamics and its effects on stream metabolism is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of stream channel hydromorphology on water transport and streambed accumulation of fine particulate matter (FPM) (mineral and organic fractions), FPOM (organic fraction) and its quality (characterized by %OM, %C, %N and the C:N molar ratio). In addition, we quantified the metabolic activity associated with FPM at the habitat scale, and its potential contribution to whole-reach ecosystem respiration using the resazurin-resorufin bioreactive tracer as a proxy for aerobic respiration. We also characterized water transport and metabolic activity with combined additions of hydrological and bioreactive tracers at the reach scale. The study was conducted in the Canoves stream (Catalonia, NE Spain) downstream of a WWTP that contains three reaches that were hydromorphologically modified using bioengineering techniques. Slower local velocities at the habitat scale increased accumulation of FPM, but did not influence the spatial variability of its quality. Instead, FPM quality declined further downstream from the WWTP. Accumulation of FPM did not increase metabolic activity, but higher %OM of FPM and lower C:N ratios favored the microbial metabolic activity efficiency (normalized by the gram of FPM). Reach-scale metabolic activity was higher in reaches with higher water exchange rate and longer relative travel times, highlighting hydromorphology as an important driver of microbial metabolic activity at the reach-scale. This demonstrates that the interplay of hydrologic exchange and residence time in streambed sediments associated with the microbial metabolic activity of FPOM can ultimately influence reach-scale metabolic activity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000671753900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B682905%26rft.atitle%3DHydromorphologic%2BControl%2Bof%2BStreambed%2BFine%2BParticle%2BStanding%2BStocks%2BInfluences%2BIn-stream%2BAerobic%2BRespiration%26rft.aufirst%3DWarren%26rft.auinit%3DW%26rft.aulast%3DMeredith%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2021.682905%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D3%26rft.au%3DMeredith%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DMarti%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
35,"Zheng, XG",2016 ,A Novel Explicit-Implicit Coupled Solution Method of SWE for Long-term River Meandering Process Induced by Dambreak,JOURNAL OF APPLIED FLUID MECHANICS,"Large amount of sediment deposits in the reservoir area can cause dam break, which not only leads to an immeasurable loss to the society, but also the sediments from the reservoir can be transported to generate further problems in the downstream catchment. This study aims to investigate the short-to-long term sediment transport and channel meandering process under such a situation. A coupled explicit-implicit technique based on the Euler-Lagrangian method (ELM) is used to solve the hydrodynamic equations, in which both the small and large time steps are used separately for the fluid and sediment marching. The main feature of the model is the use of the Characteristic-Based Split (CBS) method for the local time step iteration to correct the ELM traced lines. Based on the solved flow field, a standard Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) finite volume scheme is applied to solve the sediment transportation equation. The proposed model is first validated by a benchmark dambreak water flow experiment to validate the efficiency and accuracy of ELM modelling capability. Then an idealized engineering dambreak flow is used to investigate the long-term downstream channel meandering process with non-uniform sediment transport. The results showed that both the hydrodynamic and morphologic features have been well predicted by the proposed coupled model.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000386884200002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BNovel%2BExplicit-Implicit%2BCoupled%2BSolution%2BMethod%2Bof%2BSWE%2Bfor%2BLong-term%2BRiver%2BMeandering%2BProcess%2BInduced%2Bby%2BDambreak%26rft.aufirst%3DX.%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DXG%26rft.aulast%3DZheng%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft.eissn%3D1735-3645%26rft.epage%3D2660%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1735-3572%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BAPPLIED%2BFLUID%2BMECHANICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2647-2660%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2647%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAPPL%2BFLUID%2BMECH%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DZheng%252C%2BXG%26rft.au%3DPu%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DShao%252C%2BSD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+APPLIED+FLUID+MECHANICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
36,"Patel, A",Nov 2022 ,Stream flow prediction using TIGGE ensemble precipitation forecast data for Sabarmati river basin,WATER SUPPLY,"Flooding is the most prevalent natural disaster globally. Increasing flood frequency affects developing nations as these countries lack strong forecasting systems. The most flood-prone urban regions are near the coast or riverbanks. Using TIGGE data, a coupled atmospheric-hydro-logic ensemble flood forecasting model for the Sabarmati River was developed. Incorporating Numerical Weather Prediction information into flood forecasting systems can increase lead times from hours to days. When predicting the weather, employ numerous NWP models from various prediction centers. ECMWF, UKMO and NCEP data with a 5-day advance time are coupled with the HEC-HMS model to provide ensemble streamflow predictions. The ensemble flood forecasting model uses the 2015flood season as a test scenario. In this research, we discovered that TIGGE ensemble prediction data can be useful for prediction of streamflow and results show effective flood forecasting for Sabarmati river. HEC-HMS, a semi-distributed hydrologic model, uses ECMWF, NCEP, and UKMO precipitation ensembles. ECMWF shows the 90% of the correlation with observed data and peak time and peak discharge is also match with the observed discharge having peak on29 July 2015 with 9,300 cumecs.

Predictive modelling of this partitioning is challenging, particularly under variable hydrodynamic conditions in rivers. This paper presents a coupled hydrodynamic-geochemical model for trace metal dynamics in rivers, to highlight key parameters and set a basis for developing simplified models. A coupled model based on the hydrodynamic model MOHID and the chemical speciation model WHAM was applied to the middle part of the Garonne River (SW-France). The predictions of the coupled model are compared to those of a fixed Kd partitioning model.The model accurately simulates trace metal behaviour under varying hydrological conditions. The importance of the riverbed geomorphology and the diurnal variations in pH on TM concentrations in the water column are underlined. The sensitivity analysis ranked all physico-chemical parameters according to their influence on TM behaviour. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, water samples collected from 11 Raritan River standard sampling stations along the Raritan Estuary to the Atlantic Ocean were analyzed for concentrations of trace metals and their isotopes. The concentration of each trace metal was measured with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), with normalization of internal standard and correction with acid blanks. The metal concentration levels were compared to the National Recommended Water Quality Criteria (NRWQC). Results showed that the metal concentrations generally increased with the sampling station number, indicating that more trace metals were distributed in seawater than freshwater along the river basin. None of the sampling stations had concentrations of Cr-52 or Pb-208 exceeding the NRWQC. For Zn64+66, only the water concentration (230 mu g/L) at station 7 has exceeded the NRWQC.

39,"Lambs, L",Mar 30 2004 ,Interactions between groundwater and surface water at river banks and the confluence of rivers,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Riparian vegetation depends on hydrological resources and has to adapt to changes in water levels and soil moisture conditions. The origin and mixing of water in the streamside corridor were studied in detail. The development of riparian woodland often reflects the evolution of hydrological events. River water levels and topography are certainly the main causes of the exchange between groundwater and river water through the riverbank. Stable isotopes, such as 180, are useful tools that allow water movement to be traced. Two main water sources are typically present: (i) river water, depleted of heavy isotopes, originating upstream, and (ii) groundwater, which comes mainly from the local rainfall. On the Garonne River bank field site downstream of Toulouse, the mixing of these two waters is variable, and depends mainly on the river level and the geographical position. The output of the groundwater into the river water is not diffuse on a large scale, but localised at few places.At the confluence of two rivers, the water-mixing area is more complex because of the presence of a third source of water. In this situation, groundwater supports the hydrologic pressure of both rivers until they merge, this pressure could influence its outflow. Two cases will be presented. The first is the confluence of the Garonne and the Ariege Rivers in the south-west of France, both rivers coming from the slopes of the Pyrenees mountains. Localised groundwater outputs have been detected about 200 m before the confluence. The second case presented is the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna Rivers in the north of India, downstream of the city of Allahabad. These rivers are the two main tributaries of the Ganges, and both originate in the Himalayas. A strong stream of groundwater output was measured at the point of confluence. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

40,"Hughes, JM",Apr 2007 ,Constraints on recovery: using molecular methods to study connectivity of aquatic biota in rivers and streams,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The 'Field of Dreams Hypothesis' states 'if we build it, they will come', referring to the assumption that if habitats are restored, species will recolonise them. However, the ability of a species to recolonise a restored site will depend not only on the appropriate habitat being present, but also on the ability to get there. This is likely to depend on both the species' dispersal behaviour and the position of a site in the landscape.2. Animals with good potential for dispersal are more likely to be able to disperse to newly restored sites. Similarly, sites in lowland streams with limited altitudinal differences between sites may be easier to reach than upstream sites. This is because upstream sites are connected to one another via lowland streams that have different characteristics and therefore may be difficult for animals to traverse.3. In this paper, genetic data from a range of freshwater species that have been analysed in my laboratory are used to assess the importance of life cycle and position in the landscape (i.e. upland versus lowland streams) on connectivity patterns (and thus recolonisation potential) among populations.4. In general, contemporary dispersal across catchment boundaries is negligible, except for aquatic insects with an adult flight stage. Dispersal among streams within catchments appears to be more limited than was predicted from knowledge on life histories, except for fish in lowland rivers and streams.5. As predicted, dispersal of fish, crustaceans and molluscs among streams within catchments is significantly greater in lowland rivers than in upland streams.6. Overall, these analyses suggest that, with the exception of most insects, and fishes in lowland rivers, natural recolonisation of restored sites is only likely from sites within the same stream. If a species has disappeared from the whole stream, then restoration of habitat alone may not be sufficient for its re-establishment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000245280600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConstraints%2Bon%2Brecovery%253A%2Busing%2Bmolecular%2Bmethods%2Bto%2Bstudy%2Bconnectivity%2Bof%2Baquatic%2Bbiota%2Bin%2Brivers%2Band%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJane%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DHughes%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2006.01722.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D631%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D616-631%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D616%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D52&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The model problem consists of an idealized one-dimensional region 0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to L, where the left boundary at x = 0 is held at a fixed piezometric head h(0), and the right boundary's piezometric head at x = L is increased from h(L) to h(0) at a constant rate. Exact solutions for all times, all points in the aquifer, and for any possible constant rate of change of the right boundary piezometric head are presented for the piezometric head and the instantaneous flow rate. An exact expression for the exchange volume at the groundwater/stream interface for an arbitrary time is also provided. This expression shows that there is a specific critical rising rate of the stream level above which the net exchange volume is into the aquifer and below which it is out of the aquifer. The solution shows that regardless of the rise rate, a certain water volume, inversely proportional to the rise rate, enters the aquifer.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000178937800004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1122%26rft.atitle%3DExact%2Banalytical%2Bexpressions%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bpiezometric%2Bprofile%2Band%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Bstream%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bduring%2Band%2Bafter%2Ba%2Buniform%2Brise%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bstream%2Blevel%26rft.aufirst%3DMC%26rft.auinit%3DMC%26rft.aulast%3DBoufadel%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2001WR000780%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DBoufadel%252C%2BMC%26rft.au%3DPeridier%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Zubaroglu, A",Feb 2023 ,Online embedding and clustering of evolving data streams,STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING,"Number of connected devices is steadily increasing and this trend is expected to continue in the near future. Connected devices continuously generate data streams and the data streams may often be high dimensional and contain concept drift. Clustering is one of the most suitable methods for real-time data stream processing, since clustering can be applied with less prior information about the data. Also, data embedding makes the visualization of high dimensional data possible and may simplify clustering process. There exist several data stream clustering algorithms in the literature; however, no data stream embedding method exists. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a data embedding algorithm that is suitable to be applied on stationary (stable) data streams, though it cannot adapt concept drift. In this study, we describe a novel method EmCStream, to apply UMAP on evolving (nonstationary) data streams, to detect and adapt concept drift and to cluster embedded data instances using a distance or partitioning-based clustering algorithm. We have evaluated EmCStream against the state-of-the-art stream clustering algorithms using both synthetic and real data streams containing concept drift. EmCStream outperforms DenStream and CluStream, in terms of clustering quality, on both synthetic and real evolving data streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000825220600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOnline%2Bembedding%2Band%2Bclustering%2Bof%2Bevolving%2Bdata%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAlaettin%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DZubaroglu%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fsam.11590%26rft.eissn%3D1932-1872%26rft.epage%3D44%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1932-1864%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DSTATISTICAL%2BANALYSIS%2BAND%2BDATA%2BMINING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D29-44%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D29%26rft.stitle%3DSTAT%2BANAL%2BDATA%2BMIN%26rft.volume%3D16%26rft.au%3DZubaroglu%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DAtalay%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=STATISTICAL+ANALYSIS+AND+DATA+MINING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Hart, DD",1999 ,Physical-biological coupling in streams: The pervasive effects of flow on benthic organisms,ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS,"Flowing water has profound effects on a diverse array of ecological processes and patterns in streams and rivers. We propose a conceptual framework for investigating the multiple causal pathways by which flow influences benthic biota and focus particular attention on the local scales at which these organisms respond to flow. Flow (especially characteristics linked to the velocity field) can strongly affect habitat characteristics, dispersal, resource acquisition, competition, and predation; creative experiments will be needed to disentangle these complex interactions. Benthic organisms usually reside within the roughness layer, where the unique arrangement of sediment particles produces strongly sheared and highly three-dimensional flow patterns. Thus, accurate characterization of the local flow environments experienced by benthic organisms often requires the use of flow measurement technology with high spatial and temporal resolution. Because flow exhibits variation across a broad range of scales, it is also necessary to examine how organism-flow relationships at one scale are linked to those at others. Interdisciplinary approaches are needed in the study of physical-biological coupling; increased collaboration between ecologists and experts in fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering is particularly desirable. A greater understanding of physical-biological coupling will not only yield deeper insights into the ecological organization of streams and rivers, it will also improve our ability to predict how flow alterations caused by various human activities affect these vital ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000084882700013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPhysical-biological%2Bcoupling%2Bin%2Bstreams%253A%2BThe%2Bpervasive%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bflow%2Bon%2Bbenthic%2Borganisms%26rft.aufirst%3DDD%26rft.auinit%3DDD%26rft.aulast%3DHart%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1146%252Fannurev.ecolsys.30.1.363%26rft.epage%3D395%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0066-4162%26rft.jtitle%3DANNUAL%2BREVIEW%2BOF%2BECOLOGY%2BAND%2BSYSTEMATICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D363-395%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D363%26rft.stitle%3DANNU%2BREV%2BECOL%2BSYST%26rft.volume%3D30%26rft.au%3DHart%252C%2BDD%26rft.au%3DFinelli%252C%2BCM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=ANNUAL+REVIEW+OF+ECOLOGY+AND+SYSTEMATICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

45,"McManus, MG",Dec 1 2020 ,Variation in stream network relationships and geospatial predictions of watershed conductivity,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Secondary salinization, the increase of anthropogenically-derived salts in freshwaters, threatens freshwater biota and ecosystems, drinking water supplies, and infrastructure. The various anthropogenic sources of salts and their locations in a watershed may result in secondary salinization of river and stream networks through multiple inputs. We developed a watershed predictive assessment to investigate the degree to which topology, land-cover, and land-use covariates affect stream specific conductivity (SC), a measure of salinity. We used spatial stream network models to predict SC throughout an Appalachian stream network in a watershed affected by surface coal mining. During high-discharge conditions, 8 to 44% of stream km in the watershed exceeded the SC benchmark of 300 mu S/cm, which is meant to be protective of aquatic life in the Central Appalachian ecoregion. During low-discharge conditions, 96 to 100% of stream km exceeded the benchmark. The 2 different discharge conditions altered the spatial dependency of SC among the stream monitoring sites. During most low discharges, SC was a function of upstream-to-downstream network distances, or flow-connected distances, among the sites. Flow-connected distances are indicative of upstream dependencies affecting stream SC. During high discharge, SC was related to both flow-connected distances and flow-unconnected distances (i.e., distances between sites on different branches of the network). Flow-unconnected distances are indicative of processes on adjacent branches and their catchments affecting stream SC. With sites distributed from headwaters to the watershed outlet, the extent of impacts from secondary salinization could be better spatially predicted and assessed with spatial stream network models than with models assuming spatial independence. Importantly, the assessment also recognized the multi-scale spatial relationships that can occur between the landscape and stream network.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000568830900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariation%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%2Brelationships%2Band%2Bgeospatial%2Bpredictions%2Bof%2Bwatershed%2Bconductivity%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DMG%26rft.aulast%3DMcManus%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F710340%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D721%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D704-721%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D704%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DMcManus%252C%2BMG%26rft.au%3DD%2527Amico%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DTyler%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
46,"Meng, WW",Jan 2020 ,A 1D-2D Coupled Lattice Boltzmann Model for Shallow Water Flows in Large Scale River-Lake Systems,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,"Simulating shallow water flows in large scale river-lake systems is important but challenging because huge computer resources and time are needed. This paper aimed to propose a simple and efficient 1D-2D coupled model for simulating these flows. The newly developed lattice Boltzmann (LB) method was adopted to simulate 1D and 2D flows, because of its easy implementation, intrinsic parallelism, and high accuracy. The coupling strategy of the 1D-2D interfaces was implemented at the mesoscopic level, in which the unknown distribution functions at the coupling interfaces were calculated by the known distribution functions and the primitive variables from the adjacent 1D and 2D lattice nodes. To verify the numerical accuracy and stability, numerical tests, including dam-break flow and surge waves in the tailrace canal of a hydropower station, were simulated by the proposed model. The results agreed well with both analytical solutions and commercial software results, and second-order convergence was verified. The application of the proposed model in simulating the surge wave propagation and reflection phenomena in a reservoir of a run-of-river hydropower station indicated that it had a huge advantage in simulating flows in large-scale river-lake systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000509398900108,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B108%26rft.atitle%3DA%2B1D-2D%2BCoupled%2BLattice%2BBoltzmann%2BModel%2Bfor%2BShallow%2BWater%2BFlows%2Bin%2BLarge%2BScale%2BRiver-Lake%2BSystems%26rft.aufirst%3DWanwan%26rft.auinit%3DWW%26rft.aulast%3DMeng%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fapp10010108%26rft.eissn%3D2076-3417%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BSCIENCES-BASEL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BSCI-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DMeng%252C%2BWW%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BYG%26rft.au%3DXia%252C%2BLS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+SCIENCES-BASEL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
47,"Jin, GQ",Nov 2010 ,Transport of nonsorbing solutes in a streambed with periodic bedforms,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Previous studies of hyporheic zone focused largely on the net mass transfer of solutes between stream and streambed. Solute transport within the bed has attracted less attention. In this study, we combined flume experiments and numerical simulations to examine solute transport processes in a streambed with periodic bedforms. Solute originating from the stream was subjected to advective transport driven by pore water circulation due to current-bedform interactions as well as hydrodynamic dispersion in the porous bed. The experimental and numerical results showed that advection played a dominant role at the early stage of solute transport, which took place in the hyporheic zone. Downward solute transfer to the deep ambient flow zone was controlled by transverse dispersion at the later stage when the elapsed time exceeded the advective transport characteristic time t(c) (= L/u(c) with L being the bedform length and u(c) the characteristic pore water velocity). The advection-based pumping exchange model was found to predict reasonably well solute transfer between the overlying water and streambed at the early stage but its performance deteriorated at the later stage. With dispersion neglected, the pumping exchange model underestimated the long-term rate and total mass of solute transfer from the overlying water to the bed. Therefore both advective and dispersive transport components are essential for quantification of hyporheic exchange processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

48,"Liu, X",Jul 2021 ,Multi-Stream Spatial Digital Predistortion for Fully-Connected Hybrid Beamforming Massive MIMO Transmitters,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS,"In this paper, a novel multi-stream spatial digital predistortion (DPD) technique is proposed to model and linearize the fully-connected (FC) hybrid beamforming (HBF) transmitters. The proposed scheme solves the DPD implementation issue in the FC HBF array by estimating and linearizing the beam signals instead of the individual PAs. In FC HBF systems, significant intermodulation (IMD) between different transmit signals will be generated due to the analog beamforming and combining network upstream of the power amplifiers (PAs). The IMD beams will end up being radiated in different directions and some of them might fall in the linear beam directions. Therefore, multi-input DPD blocks using a practical multi-variable model are constructed for each RF chain to eliminate the complicated inner- and cross-channel IMDs of the beam signals. Simulations on a 4-stream 64-element FC HBF array and experimental tests on a 2-stream 4-element system are carried out to benchmark the proposed DPD technique against the conventional techniques. Better than 13 dB adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) improvement and 12 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) improvement have been achieved by the proposed DPD technique.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000658349200021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMulti-Stream%2BSpatial%2BDigital%2BPredistortion%2Bfor%2BFully-Connected%2BHybrid%2BBeamforming%2BMassive%2BMIMO%2BTransmitters%26rft.aufirst%3DXin%26rft.auinit%3DX%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTCSI.2021.3072591%26rft.eissn%3D1558-0806%26rft.epage%3D3011%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1549-8328%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BCIRCUITS%2BAND%2BSYSTEMS%2BI-REGULAR%2BPAPERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2998-3011%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2998%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BCIRCUITS-I%26rft.volume%3D68%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BWH%26rft.au%3DFeng%252C%2BZH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93va33DRSiEMnXRexCNeV&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+CIRCUITS+AND+SYSTEMS+I-REGULAR+PAPERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Hernes, PJ",Dec 15 2017 ,Connecting tropical river DOM and POM to the landscape with lignin,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,"Tropical rivers account for two thirds of global fluxes of terrigenous organic matter to the oceans, yet because of their remote locations relative to most industrialized countries, they are poorly studied compared to temperate and even Arctic rivers. Further, most tropical river research has focused on large rivers like the Amazon or Congo, yet more than half of organic matter fluxes from tropical rivers comes from much smaller rivers. This study focuses on two such rivers in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico, namely the Rio Mameyes and Rio Icacos, and uses time-series measurements of lignin biomarkers to put them in context with much bigger tropical rivers in the literature. Although lignin concentrations and carbon-normalized yields offer some distinction between mountainous vs. floodplain tropical river reaches, compositional differences appear to offer greater potential, including S:V vs. C:V plots that may capture the poorly-studied influence of palm trees, and (Ad:Al) s vs. (Ad:Al)v plots that may reflect differences in underlying mineralogy and degradation in soils. Even though dissolved and particulate lignin ultimately come from the same vegetation sources, comparison of dissolved and particulate lignin parameters within the two Puerto Rican rivers indicate that the pathways by which they end up in the same parcel of river water are largely decoupled. Across several particulate lignin studies in tropical rivers, mineral composition and concentration appears to exert a strong control on particulate lignin compositions and concentrations. Finally, the time-series nature of this study allows for new ways of analyzing dissolved lignin endmember compositions and degradation within the catchment. Plots of dissolved lignin parameters vs. lignin concentration reveal both the composition of ""fresh"" DOM that is likely mobilized from organic-rich soil surface layers along with the extent and trajectory of degradation of that signature that is possible within the lower mineral layers of the soil. Establishing connectivity between river chemistry and catchment sources and processes in this manner is the only way to realize the full potential of river chemistry as a diagnostic tool for changing sources and processes within the catchment.
