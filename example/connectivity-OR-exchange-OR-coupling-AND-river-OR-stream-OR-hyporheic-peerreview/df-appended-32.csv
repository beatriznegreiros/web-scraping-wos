0,0,"Lekebusch, A",Nov 20 1997 ,Two biochemical oscillators coupled by mass exchange,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B,"We present experiments and simulations of two mutually mass-coupled biochemical oscillators represented by the nonlinear peroxidase-oxidase reaction. The uncoupled oscillators show simple period-1 (Pi) oscillations of different frequencies for different values of the oxygen concentration in the gas stream. A phase diagram is established where the ratio of the natural frequencies is plotted versus the mass exchange rate. For each frequency ratio four regimes of behavior have been observed for an increasing mass exchange rate: (I) two independent and uncorrelated P1 oscillations; (II) quasiperiodicity in one and P1 oscillations in the other reactor; (III) quasiperiodicity in both reactors; (IV) periodic in-phase synchronization of both reactors. We use the correlation coefficient, the frequencies of the system, and the phase difference between the two cells to characterize the four regimes. A new feature of this work is the experimental observation of an ''infinite'' modulation period at the transition from the quasiperiodic region to the limit cycle that can be explained by a collision of a torus with a saddle-node bifurcation of a limit cycle (SNIPER bifurcation of codimension two). Simulations using two coupled four-variable DOP models give very good agreement with the experimental results and support our interpretation of the dynamical behavior and the observed bifurcations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1997YH53100023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTwo%2Bbiochemical%2Boscillators%2Bcoupled%2Bby%2Bmass%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DLekebusch%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fjp972257y%26rft.epage%3D9843%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1089-5647%26rft.issue%3D47%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BPHYSICAL%2BCHEMISTRY%2BB%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D9838-9843%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D9838%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BPHYS%2BCHEM%2BB%26rft.volume%3D101%26rft.au%3DLekebusch%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSchneider%252C%2BFW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+PHYSICAL+CHEMISTRY+B&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/jp972257y,,"LIMIT-CYCLE OSCILLATIONS,CHEMICAL OSCILLATORS,TIME-DELAY,PROPAGATION FAILURE,BIFURCATION,REACTORS,SYSTEMS,STATES,TRANSITION,PHASE",,
1,1,"Pu, JB",Feb 1 2017 ,In-stream metabolism and atmospheric carbon sequestration in a groundwater-fed karst stream,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Atmospheric carbon sequestered in karst systems through dissolution of carbonate minerals is considered to have no net effect on long-term regional and global carbon budgets because precipitation of dissolved carbonate minerals emits CO2 back to the atmosphere. Even though recent studies have implied that rapid kinetics of carbonate dissolution coupled with the aquatic photosynthetic uptake of dissolve inorganic carbon (DIC) could facilitate a stable atmospheric C sink in karst rivers and streams, little is known about the magnitudes and long-term stability of this C sink. To assess in-stream biogeochemical processes and their role on stream C cycling, we measured diel cycles of water characteristics and chemical composition (temperature, pH, DO, SpC, DIC, Ca2+, delta C-13(DIC)) in a groundwater-fed karst stream in southwest China. Our results show no diel variations at the groundwater discharge point (CK site) due to the absence of a sub-aquatic community (SAC). However, all hydrochemical parameters show significant diel cycle 1.3 km downstream (LY site). Diel variations in pH, DO, and delta C-13(DIC) were inversely related to diel changes in SpC, DIC, Ca2+ and pCO(2). This result indicates that in-stream metabolism (photosynthesis and respiration) of SAC controls diel variations in stream water chemistry. Significant diel cycles of net ecosystem production (NEP) influences in-stream diel fluctuation of pH, DO, SIc, DIC, pCO(2), Ca2+ and delta C-13(DIC), with gross primary production (GPP) dominating in day and ecosystem respiration (ER) dominating at the night. Absence of in-stream metabolism at CK enhances CO2 degassing from stream to the atmosphere, which is estimated to be 3-5 times higher than at LY. We estimate the carbon sink through in-streammetabolismof SAC to be 73 t C km(-2) a(-1), which is around half the rate of the oceanic biological pump. These results imply in-stream photosynthesis sequesters DIC originating from karst weathering and controls CO2 evasion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The flow rate, reagent concentration, and sample volume were optimized. The rhenium concentration was determined using the integrated peak area through interpolation of standard addition calibration curves. The relative standard deviation was less than 2.45% (n=5), the recoveries were from 94.59 to 104.11%, and the linear dynamic range of the method was up to 998ngkg(-1). There was a good agreement between the rhenium concentrations in a standard measured in this work with results from previous studies. The limit of detection was 0.11ngkg(-1) for a sample volume of 7.5mL and one cycle required 8.33min.

3,3,"Kozerski, HP",Jun 2006 ,Tracer measurements in groyne fields for the quantification of mean hydraulic residence times and of the exchange with the stream,ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA,"Tracer experiments were carried out in groyne fields (GF) of the river Elbe near Havelberg (Germany) in order to estimate the hydraulic connectivity with the river channel. The characteristic times of the five groyne fields, which were estimated from the exponentially declining tracer curves in 43 runs, ranged between 15 min and 69 min and did not correlate with the water level. Methodological investigations show that single point injection and two measurements (in the outflowing water and in the dominant region) are sufficient to provide robust in-situ tracer curves. Using simplified mathematical simulations with connected stirred tanks, the conditions are investigated for the development of breaks in tracer curves and for the occurrence of significant errors in the estimation of intrinsic residence times. It was shown that an initial uniform dye distribution is not mandatory for the estimation during steady states. In special cases, point injections are more advisable. Moreover, the mean hydraulic residence time was found to be not equivalent to the estimated characteristic time. In fact, it is mostly overestimated by tracer experiments. The degree of overestimation depends on mixing and the volumetric proportions between the different parts of the GF and can be calculated from measured dye concentration differences. For example, an overestimation of 32% was calculated for a groyne field with a commonly found circulation flow pattern.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000238715700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTracer%2Bmeasurements%2Bin%2Bgroyne%2Bfields%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bquantification%2Bof%2Bmean%2Bhydraulic%2Bresidence%2Btimes%2Band%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bexchange%2Bwith%2Bthe%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DHP%26rft.auinit%3DHP%26rft.aulast%3DKozerski%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Faheh.200400629%26rft.epage%3D200%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0323-4320%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DACTA%2BHYDROCHIMICA%2BET%2BHYDROBIOLOGICA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D188-200%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D188%26rft.stitle%3DACTA%2BHYDROCH%2BHYDROB%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DKozerski%252C%2BHP%26rft.au%3DSchwartz%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DHintze%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=ACTA+HYDROCHIMICA+ET+HYDROBIOLOGICA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/aheh.200400629,"river,dead zone,Elbe river,tracer","RIVER,FLOW,CHANNELS,MODEL",,"Leibniz Inst Gewasserokol & Binnenfischerei, Muggelseedamm 301, D-12587 Berlin, Germany"
4,4,"Richardson, JS",Aug 2005 ,Organic matter dynamics in small streams of the Pacific Northwest,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Small streams in forested landscapes are tightly coupled to the vegetation of the surrounding forest, and one of the key drivers of the stream ecosystem is the nature of organic matter supplied to it. This paper is focussed on three questions related to organic matter dynamics in small, forested streams of the conifer dominated Pacific Northwest: (1) How do small streams differ from large streams? (2) How do small streams of the Pacific Northwest differ from those of other regions? and (3) How do forest practices alter organic matter dynamics of small streams in the Pacific Northwest? The organic matter dynamics of small streams in this region differ from temperate deciduous forests in the nature of the organic matter deposited (protective chemicals, hard epidermis, slower loss rates), the timing of inputs (distributed throughout the year), and the transport rates (smaller, hard needles are more easily transported). The large amount and persistence of wood in these streams provides an additional source of organic matter that can be consumed by particular species and contributes to biofilm and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) production. Logging is commonly practiced in many forests of the region. This practice has been shown to alter the type, amount, and timing of organic matter delivery to small streams and reduce the amount and size of large wood. Changes in channel complexity and water temperature after logging also can contribute to reduced organic matter storage. Many of the processes controlling organic matter dynamics in small streams are well described in other regions. However, the climate, vegetation, and topography of the Pacific Northwest suggest that the rates and nature of some processes affecting stream organic matter may differ considerably from other regions. Further research on small streams of this area will be required to better understand these differences.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000231549900009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOrganic%2Bmatter%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bsmall%2Bstreams%2Bof%2Bthe%2BPacific%2BNorthwest%26rft.aufirst%3DJS%26rft.auinit%3DJS%26rft.aulast%3DRichardson%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1752-1688.2005.tb03777.x%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D934%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D921-934%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D921%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DRichardson%252C%2BJS%26rft.au%3DBilby%252C%2BRE%26rft.au%3DBondar%252C%2BCA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2005.tb03777.x,"aquatic ecology,detritus,food webs,headwaters,nutrients,particulate organic matter rivers/streams","SOUTHWESTERN BRITISH-COLUMBIA,ALDER ALNUS-RUBRA,HEADWATER STREAMS,FRESH-WATER,SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA,WOODY DEBRIS,OLD-GROWTH,RED ALDER,MICROBIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS,RESOURCE LIMITATION",,"Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Sci, 3041-2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada"

Nevertheless, processing and storing big data raised new scientific and technological challenges that traditional approaches cannot handle efficiently. In this paper, we address the issue of online (i.e., near real-time) data processing of automotive information. More precisely, we focus on the performance of data fusion to support several millions of connected vehicles. In order to face this performance challenge, we propose novel approaches, based on spatial indexation, to speed up our automotive application. To validate the effectiveness of our proposal, we have implemented and conducted real experiments on PSA Group (PSA Group is the second-largest automobile manufacturer in Europe with about 3 million sold vehicles in 2015) big data streaming platform.

7,7,"Wegener, P",Jun 2018 ,Evaluating Controls on Nutrient Retention and Export in Wide and Narrow Valley Segments of a Mountain River Corridor,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Over the past few decades, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations have increased within streams of the central Rockies, a pattern linked to regional N deposition trends. As NO3-N concentrations increase, in-stream biological demand may become saturated and stream N export may increase. In mountain landscapes, streams generally flow through steep, narrow valleys with limited riparian area and strong stream-hillslope connectivity. Interspersed between the narrow valleys are wide segments where substantial floodplain riparian areas can develop. Here, we coupled measures of stream reach NO3-N flux balances with nutrient enrichment experiments along two stream reaches of contrasting valley morphology in Rocky Mountain National Park. The stream reaches were (1) a narrow valley segment with limited floodplain riparian area and (2) a longitudinally adjacent (directly downstream) wide valley segment with extensive floodplain riparian area. We found that in-stream biological uptake of added NO3-N was limited in both segments, presumably as a consequence of saturating conditions. Assessment of mass flux indicated that the narrow valley segment was a consistent source of water and NO3-N across flow states, while the wide segment was a sink at high flow and a source at low flow. Due to low in-stream biological retention, gross gains and losses of water and NO3-N to and from the stream exerted primary constraint on segment mass balances. Our results suggest that the exchange of water and nutrients between the stream and adjacent landscape can exert strong control on reach-scale nutrient export, particularly in streams experiencing or approaching N saturation.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000438667200003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluating%2BControls%2Bon%2BNutrient%2BRetention%2Band%2BExport%2Bin%2BWide%2Band%2BNarrow%2BValley%2BSegments%2Bof%2Ba%2BMountain%2BRiver%2BCorridor%26rft.aufirst%3DPam%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DWegener%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2017JG004109%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D1826%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1817-1826%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1817%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D123%26rft.au%3DWegener%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DCovino%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DRhoades%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2017JG004109,"nitrogen saturation,riparian,geomorphology,nutrient retention,biogeochemistry,stream-groundwater exchange","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER,NITROGEN CRITICAL LOADS,STREAM RIPARIAN ZONES,COLORADO FRONT RANGE,NATIONAL-PARK,ALPINE VEGETATION,HEADWATER STREAMS,ROCKY-MOUNTAINS,NITRATE REMOVAL,CARBON FLUXES",,"Colorado State Univ, Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil Dept, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA"
8,8,"Broecker, T",Jan 2018 ,High-resolution simulation of free-surface flow and tracer retention over streambeds with ripples,LIMNOLOGICA,"This study presents a novel high-resolution simulation of free-surface flow and tracer retention over a streambed with ripples based on varying ripple morphologies, surface hydraulics and the transport of a tracer pulse from surface water to surface dead zone. For the simulations, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model OpenFOAM was used to solve the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in combination with an implemented transport equation. Pressure gradients at the streambed were used to account for hyporheic exchange, assuming water flow from high pressure zones to low pressure zones. Flow velocities, ripple sizes and spacing showed to significantly affect these pressure gradients, but also the transport of a passive tracer at the streambed, which was not investigated so far. Due to the velocity field, large parts of the tracer mass were transported alongside the main stream above the ripples. Tracer mass reaching the space between the ripples was temporarily retained due to low velocities and recirculations. It was shown that the retention is depending on the ripple size and space between the ripples as well as on the flow velocity. Decreasing ripple sizes and higher flow velocities lead to a smaller tracer retention. Furthermore we showed that the ripple length to height ratio controls the generation of recirculation zones which affect the residence time of the tracer significantly. Ripple spacing leads to temporarily higher tracer concentration at the streambed, but smaller tracer retention. We conclude that the impact of the streambed morphology on the hydraulics in combination with tracer retention should be addressed for a comprehensive understanding of compound movement, exchange and transformation within the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000428014700006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHigh-resolution%2Bsimulation%2Bof%2Bfree-surface%2Bflow%2Band%2Btracer%2Bretention%2Bover%2Bstreambeds%2Bwith%2Bripples%26rft.aufirst%3DTabea%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DBroecker%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.limno.2017.06.005%26rft.eissn%3D1873-5851%26rft.epage%3D58%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0075-9511%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGICA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D46-58%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D46%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOLOGICA%26rft.volume%3D68%26rft.au%3DBroecker%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DElsesser%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DHinkelmann%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGICA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.limno.2017.06.005,"Numerical modeling,Ripples,Hyporheic exchange,Tracer retention,Tracer transport,Turbulence","INDUCED HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,BED FORMS,SEDIMENT,DYNAMICS,MORPHOLOGY,INTERFACE,MECHANICS,TRANSPORT,SOLUTES",,"Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Water Resources Management & Modeling Hydro, Berlin, Germany"
9,9,"Jahkel, A",Jul 2022 ,Hydrologic Turnover Matters - Gross Gains and Losses of Six First-Order Streams Across Contrasting Landscapes and Flow Regimes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Gross gains and losses of stream water and the consequent hydrologic turnover may modify the composition of stream water and drive in-stream ecological functioning. We evaluated over 500 breakthrough curves of conservative tracer additions to analyze the channel water balance resulting in gross gains and losses, net exchange, and hydrologic turnover. During the hydrological year 2019, seven tracer experiments had been carried out in six first-order streams along 400 m study reaches. All streams are located in the Holtemme catchment (Central Germany) with three each dominated by forested and agricultural land use. Four of the six streams were characterized by net-losing conditions. The overall median of gross exchange was five times higher than net exchange. On average, subsurface gains replaced 50% of the original stream water over less than one kilometer of stream length. We even observed cases where over 95% of the stream water turned over within 100 m. Gross exchange was relatively higher in forested than in agricultural streams. Patterns of exchange in the forested streams persisted spatially and were temporally independent of streamflow, whereas in the agricultural ones, variable spatial patterns and streamflow dependence occurred. Overall, moderate flow coincided with highest relative gross exchange. Our results support previous findings that in-stream solute concentrations could heavily depend on location and magnitude of gains and losses. Gross exchange embodies a permanent but variable control of downstream solute concentrations interacting with the signal of biogeochemical activity. We highlight the importance to include reach-scale hydrological processes in studies on nutrient spiraling.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000827453000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2022WR032129%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2BTurnover%2BMatters%2B-%2BGross%2BGains%2Band%2BLosses%2Bof%2BSix%2BFirst-Order%2BStreams%2BAcross%2BContrasting%2BLandscapes%2Band%2BFlow%2BRegimes%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DJaehkel%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2022WR032129%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DJahkel%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DGraeber%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DSchmidt%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2022WR032129,"gross gain and loss,hydrologic turnover,headwater streams,reach scale,losing streams,land use","TRANSIENT STORAGE,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,WATER,NUTRIENT,TRANSPORT,SEDIMENT,HETEROGENEITY,CONNECTIVITY,DISCHARGE",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Hydrogeol, Leipzig, Germany"
10,10,"Ward, AS",Jun 2013 ,Variations in surface water-ground water interactions along a headwater mountain stream: Comparisons between transient storage and water balance analyses,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The accumulation of discharge along a stream valley is frequently assumed to be the primary control on solute transport processes. Relationships of both increasing and decreasing transient storage, and decreased gross losses of stream water have been reported with increasing discharge; however, we have yet to validate these relationships with extensive field study. We conducted transient storage and mass recovery analyses of artificial tracer studies completed for 28 contiguous 100 m reaches along a stream valley, repeated under four base-flow conditions. We calculated net and gross gains and losses, temporal moments of tracer breakthrough curves, and best fit transient storage model parameters (with uncertainty estimates) for 106 individual tracer injections. Results supported predictions that gross loss of channel water would decrease with increased discharge. However, results showed no clear relationship between discharge and transient storage, and further analysis of solute tracer methods demonstrated that the lack of this relation may be explained by uncertainty and equifinality in the transient storage model framework. Furthermore, comparison of water balance and transient storage approaches reveals complications in clear interpretation of either method due to changes in advective transport time, which sets a the temporal boundary separating transient storage and channel water balance. We have little ability to parse this limitation of solute tracer methods from the physical processes we seek to study. We suggest the combined analysis of both transient storage and channel water balance more completely characterizes transport of solutes in stream networks than can be inferred from either method alone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000322241300020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariations%2Bin%2Bsurface%2Bwater-ground%2Bwater%2Binteractions%2Balong%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bmountain%2Bstream%253A%2BComparisons%2Bbetween%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Band%2Bwater%2Bbalance%2Banalyses%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20148%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D3374%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3359-3374%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3359%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DPayn%252C%2BRA%26rft.au%3DWagener%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20148,"solute transport,stream flow,modeling,transient storage,hyporheic","LONGITUDINAL SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MASS-TRANSFER,PARAMETERS,EXCHANGE,ZONE,FLOW,RETENTION,EQUATIONS,DISCHARGE,RIVERS",,"Univ Iowa, Dept Geosci, 36 Trowbridge Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA"
11,11,"Hall, RO",May 18 2018 ,Use of argon to measure gas exchange in turbulent mountain streams,BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Gas exchange is a parameter needed in stream metabolism and trace gas emissions models. One way to estimate gas exchange is via measuring the decline of added tracer gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Estimates of oxygen (O-2) gas exchange derived from SF6 additions require scaling via Schmidt number (Sc) ratio, but this scaling is uncertain under conditions of high gas exchange via bubbles because scaling depends on gas solubility as well as Sc. Because argon (Ar) and O-2 have nearly identical Schmidt numbers and solubility, Ar may be a useful tracer gas for estimating stream O-2 exchange. Here we compared rates of gas exchange measured via Ar and SF6 for turbulent mountain streams in Wyoming, USA. We measured Ar as the ratio of Ar : N-2 using a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS). Normalizing to N-2 confers higher precision than simply measuring [Ar] alone. We consistently enriched streams with Ar from 1 to 18% of ambient Ar concentration and could estimate gas exchange rate using an exponential decline model. The mean ratio of gas exchange of Ar relative to SF6 was 1.8 (credible interval 1.1 to 2.5) compared to the theoretical estimate 1.35, showing that using SF6 would have underestimated exchange of Ar. Steep streams (slopes 11-12 %) had high rates of gas exchange velocity normalized to Sc = 600 (k 600, 57-210 md(-1)), and slope strongly predicted variation in k 600 among all streams. We suggest that Ar is a useful tracer because it is easily measured, requires no scaling assumptions to estimate rates of O-2 exchange, and is not an intense greenhouse gas as is SF6. We caution that scaling from rates of either Ar or SF6 gas exchange to CO2 is uncertain due to solubility effects in conditions of bubble-mediated gas transfer.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000432490500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUse%2Bof%2Bargon%2Bto%2Bmeasure%2Bgas%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bturbulent%2Bmountain%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BO.%26rft.auinit%3DRO%26rft.aulast%3DHall%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fbg-15-3085-2018%26rft.eissn%3D1726-4189%26rft.epage%3D3092%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1726-4170%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3085-3092%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3085%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO%26rft.au%3DMadinger%252C%2BHL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/bg-15-3085-2018,,"CARBON-DIOXIDE,FLOWING WATERS,METABOLISM,PRODUCTIVITY,REAERATION,TRACERS",,"Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA"

However, carbon dioxide (CO2) degassing via water-air interface from inland waters currently has a large uncertainty in estimation. Here we examined the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and CO2 degassing in the Daning River, a main tributary of the Yangtze in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region. The riverine pCO(2 )showed obvious spatial and temporal variations on the main stem and its tributaries, ranging from 483,2 +/- 293.9 mu atm (May) to 2183.3 +/- 1309.2 mu atm (August) with an average of 1198.2 +/- 1122.9 mu atm. pCO(2) increased with the intensive agricultural practices and population on the lower reach of the tributary. The daytime average water-air CO2 flux was 329.8 +/- 470.2 mmol/m(2)/d, and yielded a total CO2 efflux approximately 0.12 Tg CO2/y. The results also indicated that carbon loss via atmospheric exchange accounted for 38.8% of riverine dissolved carbon fluxes. There were close relations between pCO(2) and environmental parameters such as total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and water temperature in the rainy season, but not in the dry season. Our results demonstrated the essential need to highlight the importance of anthropogenic activities on global and regional CO2 outgassing, and it is urgent to underscore the detailed biogeochemical processes in riverine pCO(2), as well as the couplings between pCO(2) and environmental parameters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000457952900036,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCO2%2Bpartial%2Bpressure%2Band%2BCO2%2Bdegassing%2Bin%2Bthe%2BDaning%2BRiver%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bupper%2BYangtze%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DMaofei%26rft.auinit%3DMF%26rft.aulast%3DNi%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2018.12.017%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.epage%3D494%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D483-494%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D483%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D569%26rft.au%3DNi%252C%2BMF%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BSY%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BXX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.017,"CO2 emission,CO(2 )partial pressure (pCO(2)),Water-air gas exchange,Anthropogenic controls,Subtropical river,Three Gorges Reservoir","CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,3 GORGES RESERVOIR,INORGANIC CARBON,LAND-USE,ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION,SURFACE-WATER,YELLOW-RIVER,PCO(2),LAKES",,"Chinese Acad Sci, CIGIT, 266,Fangzheng Ave,Shuitu High Tech Pk, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China"
13,13,"Abdul-Aziz, OI",May 2019 ,Evaluating the Emergent Controls of Stream Water Quality with Similitude and Dimensionless Numbers,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The emergent hydrologic and land-use controls of coastal-urban stream water quality were evaluated by using similitude and dimensional analysis, considering southeast Florida a prototype of growing coastal-urban environments. The goal was to test a fundamental hypothesis that the coastal-urban stream water quality processes represent emergent ecohydrological-biogeochemical similitudes (parametric reductions). The in-stream total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and biomass (Chl a) were normalized by their immediate upstream reach concentrations to formulate the dimensionless numbers of TN=TN0, TP=TP0, and Chl a=Chl a(0). Stream dissolved oxygen (DO) was normalized by its saturated concentration (DOsat) to obtain the dimensionless DO/DOsat number-avoiding a misleading scaling by upstream concentrations in the presence of a DO sag phenomenon. The emergent controls of stream water quality were represented by a small set of dominant driver dimensionless numbers. For each water quality indicator, nine original variables (including predictors and response) were reduced to three to four important and mechanistically meaningful dimensionless numbers. The hydrologic control number (role of watershed hydrology versus the external Everglades) and salinity number (ratio of downstream to upstream salinity) exhibited the key controls on stream TN=TN0 across the wet and dry seasons. In contrast, the land-use number (ratio of agricultural plus vegetated lands to built lands), hydrologic control number, and salinity number dominated TP=TP0 and Chl a/Chl a(0) incorporating the two seasons. However, DO/DOsat was controlled by the hyporheic exchange number (role of watershed groundwater versus surface hydrology) and land-use number in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The formulated similitude and dimensionless numbers provided important insights and understanding that may help achieve healthy coastal-urban streams.

To assess the effect of sample volume on perceived assemblage composition, we compared results from 10 consecutive one-L samples collected using a Bou-Rouch pump from each of nine wells inserted in a 9 m(2) area in the down-welling hyporheic zone of the Rhone River, France, and in a weakly-upwelling zone of a slowly-flowing anabranch. At the upwelling site, assemblage composition, numbers of taxa, and density of individuals per L in the first few one-L samples were significantly different from those of subsequent samples. Although numbers of taxa and individuals levelled off after the third to fifth L, perceived assemblage composition continued to change with increasing sample volume. In contrast, consecutive samples from most of the wells at the downwelling site collected progressively fewer individuals. However, assemblage composition was also strongly associated with sample volume, largely due to differences in relative abundance. Despite these effects of sample volume at both sites, differences in perceived assemblage composition among wells were consistent at volumes of 3 - 5 L in most cases. There was evidence for a 'filtering effect' with small-bodied taxa such as nematodes, ostracods and cladocerans being preferentially collected in the early samples. However, larger taxa (e. g., isopods) tended to occur equally often in earlier and later samples. Taxonomic resolution of specimens to order instead of species level did not significantly change the general ordination patterns of assemblage composition among wells at both sites. Overall, our results imply that a sample volume of 5L and broad-level taxonomic resolution would suffice to reveal spatial variation in assemblage composition between these two sites and, at a finer scale, among wells.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000220868000003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bsample%2Bvolume%2Band%2Btaxonomic%2Bresolution%2Bon%2Bassessment%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bassemblage%2Bcomposition%2Bsampled%2Busing%2Ba%2BBou-Rouch%2Bpump%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F0003-9136%252F2004%252F0159-0327%26rft.epage%3D355%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D327-355%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D327%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D159%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DDole-Olivier%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0159-0327,"hyporheos,perceived assemblage composition,pump samples,Rhone River,taxonomic resolution,sampling strategies,'filtering effect'","MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,GROUNDWATER,STREAMS,FAUNA,CLASSIFICATION,EXCHANGE,WATER,RIVER,ZONE,INVERTEBRATES",,"Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia"
15,15,"Krause, S",Mar 2013 ,Streambed nitrogen cycling beyond the hyporheic zone: Flow controls on horizontal patterns and depth distribution of nitrate and dissolved oxygen in the upwelling groundwater of a lowland river,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Biogeochemical turnover in hyporheic zones is known to have the potential to affect the chemical signature of surface water cycling through shallow streambed sediments. This study investigates the impact of streambed physical properties on the fate of nitrate and dissolved oxygen in groundwater upwelling through the streambed of a lowland river. For analyzing depth-dependent patterns and zonation of nitrogen concentrations, diffuse gel probes in shallow (top 15 cm) streambed sediments have been deployed in a nested setup together with multilevel minipiezometers for streambed sediments of 15-150 cm. Spatial heterogeneity of groundwater upwelling was controlled by patterns of low-conductivity peat and clay strata that caused locally confined conditions, suggesting increased streambed residence times. Nitrate concentrations in the upwelling groundwater changed by up to 68.06 mg L-1 within the top 15 cm of streambed sediments and by up to 107.47 mg L-1 at depths of 15-150 cm, indicating that significant nitrogen turnover was not restricted to shallow streambed sediments. Intensive reduction of nitrate concentrations was found, in particular, in vicinity of low-conductivity streambed strata. The coincidence of confined groundwater upwelling and reduced oxygen concentrations at these locations suggests that increased residence times and associated depletion of dissolved oxygen create conditions favorable for nitrate reduction. Our results highlight that increased nitrogen turnover at aquifer-river interfaces is not necessarily limited to shallow streambed zones, where surface water is mixing with groundwater, but can affect upwelling groundwater in reactive hot spots that extend to greater streambed depths and beyond hyporheic mixing zones.

A strong coupling is found at a critical streaming velocity and such coupling results in the local buckling of single-walled or multi-walled CNTs. The flow-excited radial resonance and the drastic energy exchange-induced radial deformation amplification of the tube contribute to the occurrence of buckling. The tube instability in turn gives rise to the unstable water transport. In contrast to instability occurrence of lamped-lamped macropipes conveying fluid, fully fixing tube's boundary atoms may eliminate such instability. Combined with the finite element analysis, the effects of the tube size, hydrostatic pressure, van der Waals interaction strength, and the tube wall number on the buckling are discussed. The unusual result is that increasing the hydrostatic pressure weakens the tube's stability.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000345389900008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStrong%2Bmechanical%2Bcoupling%2Bbetween%2Bthe%2Bcarbon%2Bnanotube%2Band%2Bthe%2Binner%2Bstreaming%2Bwater%2Bflow%26rft.aufirst%3DY.%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DYD%26rft.aulast%3DKuang%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10404-014-1391-1%26rft.eissn%3D1613-4990%26rft.epage%3D1060%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1613-4982%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DMICROFLUIDICS%2BAND%2BNANOFLUIDICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1053-1060%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1053%26rft.stitle%3DMICROFLUID%2BNANOFLUID%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DKuang%252C%2BYD%26rft.au%3DShi%252C%2BSQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=MICROFLUIDICS+AND+NANOFLUIDICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10404-014-1391-1,"Carbon nanotubes,Molecular flow,Buckling instability,Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations,Finite element analysis","TRANSPORT,MEMBRANES,DIFFUSION,DYNAMICS,FLUID",,"Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China"

The argon concentration time-series was used to investigate the physical gas dynamics in the hyporheic zone. Differences in the transport behavior of heat and gas were determined by comparing the diel temperature evolution of groundwater to the measured concentration of dissolved argon. These differences were most likely caused by vertical heat transport which influenced the local groundwater temperature. The argon concentration time series were also used to estimate travel times by cross correlating argon concentrations in the groundwater with argon concentrations in the river. The information gained from quantifying the physical gas transport was used to estimate the oxygen turnover in groundwater after water recharge. The resulting oxygen turnover showed strong diel variations, which correlated with the water temperature during groundwater recharge. Hence, the variation in the consumption rate was most likely caused by the temperature dependence of microbial activity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000321521400043,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DArgon%2BConcentration%2BTime-Series%2BAs%2Ba%2BTool%2Bto%2BStudy%2BGas%2BDynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DLars%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DMaechler%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes305309b%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D7066%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7060-7066%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7060%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DMachler%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DBrennwald%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DKipfer%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es305309b,,"NOBLE-GASES,ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY,BANK FILTRATION,SHALLOW AQUIFER,GROUND-WATER,EXCESS AIR,OXYGEN,PALEOTEMPERATURE,EXCHANGE,RIVER",,"Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Water Resources & Drinking Water, Dubendorf, Switzerland"
18,18,"Lian, YQ",Oct 15 2007 ,Coupling of hydrologic and hydraulic models for the Illinois River Basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The Hydrologic Simulation Program - Fortran (HSPF) was applied to the Illinois River Basin using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) system. Values of the HSPF model parameters were based on the calibrations of three representative watersheds within the basin. Over the 1985-1995 simulation period, monthly and annual mass balances correlated well with observed discharges at three gaging stations along the Illinois River. However, poor correlation of daily flows was due largely to the weakness of the HSPF model in routing dynamic flows through the complicated Illinois River system. To address this problem, a one-dimensional unsteady state flow model (UNET) developed for the main stem of the Illinois River was coupled with the HSPF model to perform the flow routing. Comparison of hydrographs showed much closer correlation between coupled HSPF-UNET model simulations of daily flows and observed flow hydrographs. This study also showed that peak flows simulated by the HSPF model occurred several days before the actual observations. However, the coupled HSPF-UNET model simulated peak flow time more closely to the observations. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) computed using observed and simulated daily flows from HSPF and HSPF-UNET models was 0.72 and 0.79 at Marseilles, 0.63 and 0.82 at Kingston Mines, and 0.40 and 0.85 at Valley City, respectively. As expected, the NSE computed using mean monthly flows was also slightly better from HSPF-UNET than from HSPF, but the annual NSE values were nearly same from both models. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we conducted an empirical analysis and ARIMA prediction of the coupled production-living-ecological function coordination level in the Yellow River Basin of China from 2008 to 2018, and found that: (1) In terms of temporal evolution, the production-living-ecological function and coupling coordination level of each province and region in the Yellow River Basin generally shows a sharp and then slow upward trend, with the living functions changing more than the production and ecological functions; (2) in terms of spatial pattern, the production and living functions of each province and region show the trend of functional level increasing from east to west over time; the ecological functions, contrary to production and living functions, show a ""high-low"" aggregation, midstream shows ""low-low"" aggregation, and downstream shows ""low-high"" aggregation; (3) According to the regression results of the spatial Dubin model, the environmental governance level, technological research and development level, and social security level and resource dependence degree have positive promoting and spillover effects on the coupling coordination level of the ""production-living-ecological"" function in the region. However, population density and carbon emission intensity will hinder the development of regional coupling coordination level; (4) from the ARIMA prediction, the coupling coordination level of ""production-living-ecological"" in the Yellow River Basin continues the development trend of 2008-2018 in the short term, the overall coordination level is at a high level, and the variability of coupling coordination level among provinces and regions is further reduced.

20,20,"Sracek, O",Jun 2018 ,"Redox buffering and de-coupling of arsenic and iron in reducing aquifers across the Red River Delta, Vietnam, and conceptual model of de-coupling processes",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Analysis of over 500 groundwater samples from throughout the Red River Delta indicates de-coupling of dissolved arsenic (As) and dissolved iron (Fe). Sorting of all data along the redox potentials suggests re-adsorption of As released initially from Mn (IV)-oxyhydroxides and later from Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides on remaining ferric phases at moderate redox levels. A gradually decreasing specific surface area available for re-adsorption of As probably plays a role as a consequence of limited reactivity of more crystalline phases such as goethite and hematite. At low redox levels, concentrations of Fe and phosphate decrease, but As concentrations keep increasing and most As is present as As(III) with limited adsorption affinity. Based on the results of speciation modeling, the water is supersaturated with respect to siderite and vivianite. A general conceptual model of As and Fe behavior is presented, suggesting that coupled behavior is possible in two geochemical ""windows"", i.e., 1: between saturation of remaining adsorption sites and the onset of siderite and vivianite precipitation, and 2: after the beginning of secondary sulfide phases precipitation and during methanogenesis. The de-coupling of As from Fe is common and has been observed at many sites around the world where As is released as a consequence of redox processes, e.g., in Bangladesh, West Bengal and Assam in India, the Mekong Delta in Cambodia and Vietnam, and Taiwan. The presented general conceptual model of de-coupling processes can be applied to the interpretation of As and Fe data, and, thus, it can help in the preparation of a site conceptual model which is a necessary prerequisite for reactive transport modeling.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434051300060,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRedox%2Bbuffering%2Band%2Bde-coupling%2Bof%2Barsenic%2Band%2Biron%2Bin%2Breducing%2Baquifers%2Bacross%2Bthe%2BRed%2BRiver%2BDelta%252C%2BVietnam%252C%2Band%2Bconceptual%2Bmodel%2Bof%2Bde-coupling%2Bprocesses%26rft.aufirst%3DOndra%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DSracek%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-018-1801-0%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D15961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D16%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D15954-15961%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D15954%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DSracek%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DBerg%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DMuller%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11356-018-1801-0,"Arsenic Iron,De-coupling,Reductive dissolution,Red River Delta,Fe speciation","DRINKING-WATER RESOURCES,BANGLADESH GROUNDWATER,GEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES,REACTIVE TRANSPORT,WEST-BENGAL,FE RELEASE,CONTAMINATION,SEDIMENT,TAIWAN,PLAIN",,"Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Olomouc, Czech Republic"

The evaluation of these properties represents a key component in qualitative and quantitative research on groundwater-surface water interactions. Therefore, this paper reviews the research results on groundwater-surface water interactions achieved by related researchers using heat as a natural tracer over the last decade. In connection with the application of heat-tracing theory to the basic principles of hyporheic exchange between groundwater and surface water, research on groundwater-surface water interaction through one-dimensional steady-state and transient-state heat transport analytical models, techniques to collect and analyze temperature time series data, and numerical simulation technology is reviewed. In addition, directions for future research using groundwater-surface water heat-tracing methods are suggested. First, hypothetical, difficult temperature boundary and hydrogeological conditions require further research. Second, hydrodynamic exchange capacity and the processes of heat exchange and solute concentration exchange in the hyporheic zone alongside riverbeds should be appropriately and accurately measured under multi-scale influences. Third, the overall study of the heat transport process inside the hyporheic zone induced by complex riverbed forms should be performed, and the response mechanism of riverbed hyporheic exchanges driven by riverbed form, the hydrodynamic force of surface water, and sediment permeability should be revealed. The objectives and goals of this paper are to encourage scholars interested in analyzing groundwater-surface water interactions using heat as a tracer to creatively solve practical problems and to improve the ecological functions of river aquatic habitats through new research results.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000450493000011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B756%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Breview%2Bon%2Busing%2Bheat%2Bas%2Ba%2Btool%2Bfor%2Bstudying%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Binteractions%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-018-7959-4%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D22%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D77%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BJQ%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BYJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-018-7959-4,"Hyporheic zone,Groundwater-surface water interactions,Heat,Temperature time series","TEMPERATURE TIME-SERIES,STREAMBED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,HYPORHEIC ZONE,FLUID-FLOW,AQUIFER INTERACTION,EXCHANGE,FLUXES,DISCHARGE,DYNAMICS,TRACER",,"Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China"
22,22,"Malama, B",Apr 2014 ,Theory of transient streaming potentials in coupled unconfined aquifer- unsaturated zone flow to a well,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A semianalytical solution is presented for transient streaming potentials associated with flow to a pumping well in an unconfined aquifer, taking into account the effect of flow in the unsaturated zone above the water table. Flow in the unsaturated zone is modeled with a linearized form of Richards' equation using an exponential model for soil moisture retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Archie's law is invoked for unsaturated electrical conductivity. The unsaturated electrokinetic coupling coefficient is modeled with a decaying exponential, where the maximum value is at and below the water table. The coupled flow and electrokinetic problem is solved using Laplace and Hankel transforms. The results of the model predicted behavior are presented and compared to that observed in laboratory simulations of pumping tests. The early time polarity reversal predicted the model is observable in the experiments. Other nonmonotonic streaming potential behaviors predicted by the model are also evident in experimental measurements. The model is used to estimate hydraulic parameters from SP data and these compare well to those obtained from drawdown data. For example, a hydraulic conductivity of 3.6 x 10(-4) m/s is obtained from SP data compared to 3.4 x 10(-4) m/s from drawdown data.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000336026000010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTheory%2Bof%2Btransient%2Bstreaming%2Bpotentials%2Bin%2Bcoupled%2Bunconfined%2Baquifer-%2Bunsaturated%2Bzone%2Bflow%2Bto%2Ba%2Bwell%26rft.aufirst%3DBwalya%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DMalama%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR014909%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2945%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2921-2945%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2921%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR014909,"electrokinetic,streaming potentials,transient,unconfined aquifer,unsaturated zone,hydraulic conductivity","PUMPING TEST,WATER-TABLE,POROUS-MEDIA,YIELD,SAND,INVERSION",,"Sandia Natl Labs, Performance Assessment Dept, Carlsbad, CA 88220 USA"

Repeated wet-dry cycles generate highly dynamic settings within river networks composed of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, which act as evolutionary triggers for aquatic and terrestrial biota. Drying also alters functions and processes within river networks, with consequences for ecosystem services. Despite the emergence of promising conceptual and methodological developments, our understanding of the occurrence and diversity of organisms in these ecosystems is limited primarily due to their coupled aquatic-terrestrial characteristics. Novel genomic tools based on high-throughput sequencing have the potential to tackle unanswered questions of pivotal importance to predict future change in IRES. Here, we outline why genomic tools are needed to assess these dynamic ecosystems from the population to the metacommunity scale, and their potential role in bridging ecological-evolutionary dynamics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000694637100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUnlocking%2Bour%2Bunderstanding%2Bof%2Bintermittent%2Brivers%2Band%2Bephemeral%2Bstreams%2Bwith%2Bgenomic%2Btools%26rft.aufirst%3DRosetta%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DRC%26rft.aulast%3DBlackman%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Ffee.2404%26rft.eissn%3D1540-9309%26rft.epage%3D583%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1540-9295%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BECOLOGY%2BAND%2BTHE%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D574-583%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D574%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BECOL%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DBlackman%252C%2BRC%26rft.au%3DAltermatt%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+ECOLOGY+AND+THE+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/fee.2404,,"ENVIRONMENTAL DNA,GAMMARUS-FOSSARUM,DIVERSITY,BIODIVERSITY,KNOWLEDGE,ECOLOGY,FUTURE",,"Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Dubendorf, Switzerland"

The presented formulas allow for an easy computation of the values of the stream function with arbitrary precision in the case of well-separated cylinders. The considered problem is important for applications such as eddy flows in oceans.

Inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used for these analyzes. Chemometric techniques, including analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis were applied for assessing variation in the results. Analysis of variance highlighted elements that were influenced by increased river flow in the wet season, and Pearson correlation established a positive correlation between elements. Cluster analysis showed a number of sample points in two main clusters according to their loading. Principal component analysis extracted five main components with each characterized by specific metals.

According to this concept, the system is assumed to be decomposable into a set of fuzzily connected simple local models. The main thrust of this paper is in the development of an original approach for the self-design, self-monitoring, self-management, and self-learning of such systems in a dynamic manner from data streams which automatically detect and react to the shift in the data distribution by evolving the system structure. Novelties of this contribution lie in the following: 1) the computationally simple approach (simpl_e_Clustering-simplified evolving Clustering) to data space partitioning by recursive evolving clustering based on the relative position of the new data sample to the mean of the overall data, 2) the learning technique for online structure evolution as a reaction to the shift in the data distribution, 3) the method for online system structure simplification based on utility and inputs/feature selection, and 4) the novel graphical illustration of the spatiotemporal evolution of the data stream. The application domain for this computationally efficient technique ranges from clustering, modeling, prognostics, classification, and time-series prediction to pattern recognition, image segmentation, vector quantization, etc., to more general problems in various application areas, e. g., intelligent sensors, mobile robotics, advanced manufacturing processes, etc.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000293708200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFuzzily%2BConnected%2BMultimodel%2BSystems%2BEvolving%2BAutonomously%2BFrom%2BData%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DPlamen%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DAngelov%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTSMCB.2010.2098866%26rft.eissn%3D1941-0492%26rft.epage%3D910%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1083-4419%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BSYSTEMS%2BMAN%2BAND%2BCYBERNETICS%2BPART%2BB-CYBERNETICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D898-910%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D898%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BSYST%2BMAN%2BCY%2BB%26rft.volume%3D41&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+SYSTEMS+MAN+AND+CYBERNETICS+PART+B-CYBERNETICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2098866,"Evolving fuzzy systems,fuzzily weighted recursive least-squares estimation,fuzzy rule-based systems",IDENTIFICATION,,"Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, InfoLab21, Lancaster LA1 4WA, England"
28,28,"Gooseff, MN",Sep 2003 ,"Comparing transient storage modeling and residence time distribution (RTD) analysis in geomorphically varied reaches in the Lookout Creek basin, Oregon, USA",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The stream tracer technique has been widely used as a method of characterizing hyporheic exchange in stream-catchment studies, commonly incorporating the use of the numerical, transient storage model OTIS, which assumes an exponential residence time distribution. In this study, we compare OTIS and, a model that admits a general residence time distribution (RTD), called solute transport and multirate mass transfer-linear coordinates (STAMMT-L). Models were compared using slug-tracer injections of rhodamine WT (RWT) in three geomorphically distinct stream reaches in the Lookout Creek basin, Oregon USA: a second-order reach of a stream in Watershed 3 which is characterized by pool-step morphology; and two fourth-order reaches of Lookout Creek, one characterized by a single-thread, pool-step morphology, the other a morphologically complex reach with braided channels. OTIS modeling results tended to match short time scale concentrations well, including the advective peak, but the simulated late-time RTD of stream RWT concentrations was in error. The STAMMT-L model allowed for more accurate characterization of late-time stream RWT concentrations, and so characterized a larger portion of the entire RTD. Although both models are sensitive to morphologic differences among the studied stream reaches, they are also clearly different in the relative importance placed on short vs. long residence time distributions. Consequently the two models will result in different views of the hyporheic zone and its role in stream ecosystem processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The first one is called free-surface hydraulics, and carries out the balance of mass and momentum throughout the route of the river; whereas the second one is called a hydrogeological structure, and it carries out the balance of mass combined with Darcy's law in each of the aquifers of interest for evaluation purposes. Once the two types of models have been calibrated with field parameters, the coupling process occurs in iterative terms. The models must satisfy, separately, the criteria of internal convergence of their respective processes. The complete model is satisfactory if the iterative coupling process and the hydrogeological and hydraulic models converge. The conceptual approach is applied to the Papagayo River and the aquifers located on the river banks known as Norte, Obra de Toma, and Lomas de Chapultepec, to the south of the General Ambrosio Figueroa dam, in the State of Guerrero.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000261446500013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluation%2Bof%2Briver-aquifer%2Bsupply%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DJuan%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DDiego%2BMartinez-Najera%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft.epage%3D187%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0186-4076%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DINGENIERIA%2BHIDRAULICA%2BEN%2BMEXICO%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D173-187%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D173%26rft.stitle%3DING%2BHIDRAUL%2BMEX%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DMartinez-Najera%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DBerezowsky-Verduzco%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=INGENIERIA+HIDRAULICA+EN+MEXICO&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"river-aquifer coupled systems,Saint-Venant equations,balance of flow in aquifers,Darcy's law","STREAM/AQUIFER INTERACTION,SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER,EQUATION,SEEPAGE",,"Comis Fed Elect, Calle Ingenieros & Doctores 402,Col El Marquez, Queretaro 76047, Mexico"
30,30,"Karwan, DL",Dec 2001 ,Changing near-stream land use and river channel morphology in the Venezuelan Andes,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"The shape of a river channel is linked to surrounding land use through interacting hydrologic and geologic processes. This study analyzes the relationship between the change in nearstream land use and the shape of the adjacent river channel over time. Three watersheds in the foothills of the Venezuelan Andes that have experienced differing degrees of development were studied to determine river channel width, sinuosity, and position relative to surrounding land use. Change in land use over time was obtained from multiple-date aerial photographs (1946 and 1980) referenced to 1996 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, and verified by field inspection. Measurements of land-use type and amount and river channel morphology from the two dates were made using geographic information system (GIS) methods. The three watersheds differed in the extent of deforestation, the location of remaining forested land, and how much land-use change had already occurred by 1946. Change in river channel morphology was greatest at the most deforested sites. Valley shape and channel constraint also had a discernible effect on change in channel morphology. This study introduces a method for analyzing change in coupled terrestrial-aquatic systems based on multiple-date, remotely sensed data and GIS analysis of spatial properties. The results document human impacts on river channels through a comparison of multiple watersheds over a 35-year time interval.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000173379400012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DChanging%2Bnear-stream%2Bland%2Buse%2Band%2Briver%2Bchannel%2Bmorphology%2Bin%2Bthe%2BVenezuelan%2BAndes%26rft.aufirst%3DDL%26rft.auinit%3DDL%26rft.aulast%3DKarwan%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1752-1688.2001.tb03661.x%26rft.epage%3D1587%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1579-1587%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1579%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D37%26rft.au%3DKarwan%252C%2BDL%26rft.au%3DAllan%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DBergen%252C%2BKM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2001.tb03661.x,"aerial photography,geographic information systems,remote sensing,land-use change,rivers,channel morphology,riparian,watershed","MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES,CATCHMENT,INTEGRITY",,"Univ Michigan Ann Arbor, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 30789 Minton, Livonia, MI 48150 USA"

32,32,"Payn, RA",Oct 2017 ,A coupled metabolic-hydraulic model and calibration scheme for estimating whole-river metabolism during dynamic flow conditions,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS,"Conventional methods for estimating whole-stream metabolic rates from measured dissolved oxygen dynamics do not account for the variation in solute transport times created by dynamic flow conditions. Changes in flow at hourly time scales are common downstream of hydroelectric dams (i.e., hydropeaking), and hydrologic limitations of conventional metabolic models have resulted in a poor understanding of the controls on biological production in these highly managed river ecosystems. To overcome these limitations, we coupled a two-station metabolic model of dissolved oxygen dynamics with a hydrologic river routing model. We designed calibration and parameter estimation tools to infer values for hydrologic and metabolic parameters based on time series of water quality data, achieving the ultimate goal of estimating whole-river gross primary production and ecosystem respiration during dynamic flow conditions. Our case study data for model design and calibration were collected in the tailwater of Glen Canyon Dam (Arizona, U.S.A.), a large hydropower facility where the mean discharge was 325 m(3) s(-1) and the average daily coefficient of variation of flow was 0.17 (i.e., the hydropeaking index averaged from 2006 to 2016). We demonstrate the coupled model's conceptual consistency with conventional models during steady flow conditions, and illustrate the potential bias in metabolism estimates with conventional models during unsteady flow conditions. This effort contributes an approach to solute transport modeling and parameter estimation that allows study of whole-ecosystem metabolic regimes across a more diverse range of hydrologic conditions commonly encountered in streams and rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000413768000003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bcoupled%2Bmetabolic-hydraulic%2Bmodel%2Band%2Bcalibration%2Bscheme%2Bfor%2Bestimating%2Bwhole-river%2Bmetabolism%2Bduring%2Bdynamic%2Bflow%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DR.%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DRA%26rft.aulast%3DPayn%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Flom3.10204%26rft.epage%3D866%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1541-5856%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D847-866%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D847%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR-METH%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DPayn%252C%2BRA%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO%26rft.au%3DMarshall%252C%2BLA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/lom3.10204,,"GLEN CANYON DAM,COLORADO RIVER,STREAM METABOLISM,GAS-EXCHANGE,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,STATISTICAL-MODEL,INLAND WATERS,GRAND-CANYON,TERRESTRIAL,DOWNSTREAM",,"Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA"

We consider a C-2 connected (not necessarily simply connected) oriented hypersurface Gamma subset of R-3 without boundary. The surface gradient, divergence, curl and Laplace operators are defined in terms of the standard differential operators of the ambient Euclidean space R-3. These representations are very convenient for the implementation of numerical methods for surface partial differential equations. We introduce surface H(div(Gamma)) and H(curl(Gamma)) spaces and derive useful properties of these spaces. A main result of the paper is the derivation of the Helmholtz decomposition, in terms of these surface differential operators, based on elementary differential calculus. As a corollary of this decomposition we obtain that for a simply connected surface to every tangential divergence-free velocity field there corresponds a unique scalar stream function. Using this result the variational form of the surface Stokes equation can be reformulated as a well-posed variational formulation of a fourth-order equation for the stream function. The latter can be rewritten as two coupled second-order equations, which form the basis for a finite element discretization. A particular finite element method is explained and the results of a numerical experiment with this method are presented.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000544720400004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStream%2Bfunction%2Bformulation%2Bof%2Bsurface%2BStokes%2Bequations%26rft.aufirst%3DArnold%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DReusken%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1093%252Fimanum%252Fdry062%26rft.eissn%3D1464-3642%26rft.epage%3D139%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0272-4979%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DIMA%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BNUMERICAL%2BANALYSIS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D109-139%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D109%26rft.stitle%3DIMA%2BJ%2BNUMER%2BANAL%26rft.volume%3D40&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=IMA+JOURNAL+OF+NUMERICAL+ANALYSIS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1093/imanum/dry062,"surface Stokes,surface Helmholtz decomposition,stream function formulation","FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD,NAVIER-STOKES,FLOW,DYNAMICS,MOTION,SPACES",,"Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Geometr & Prakt Math, D-52056 Aachen, Germany"
35,35,"Alzraiee, AH",Mar 30 2017 ,Assimilation of historical head data to estimate spatial distributions of stream bed and aquifer hydraulic conductivity fields,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Management of water resources in alluvial aquifers relies mainly on understanding interactions between hydraulically connected streams and aquifers. Numerical models that simulate this interaction often are used as decision support tools for water resource management. However, the accuracy of numerical predictions relies heavily on unknown system parameters (e.g., streambed conductivity and aquifer hydraulic conductivity), which are spatially heterogeneous and difficult to measure directly. This paper employs an ensemble smoother to invert groundwater level measurements to jointly estimate spatially varying streambed and alluvial aquifer hydraulic conductivity along a 35.6-km segment of the South Platte River in Northeastern Colorado. The accuracy of the inversion procedure is evaluated using a synthetic experiment and historical groundwater level measurements, with the latter constituting the novelty of this study in the inversion and validation of high-resolution fields of streambed and aquifer conductivities. Results show that the estimated streambed conductivity field and aquifer conductivity field produce an acceptable agreement between observed and simulated groundwater levels and stream flow rates. The estimated parameter fields are also used to simulate the spatially varying flow exchange between the alluvial aquifer and the stream, which exhibits high spatial variability along the river reach with a maximum average monthly aquifer gain of about 2.3 m(3)/day and a maximum average monthly aquifer loss of 2.8 m(3)/day, per unit area of streambed (m(2)). These results demonstrate that data assimilation inversion provides a reliable and computationally affordable tool to estimate the spatial variability of streambed and aquifer conductivities at high resolution in real-world systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000397844100006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAssimilation%2Bof%2Bhistorical%2Bhead%2Bdata%2Bto%2Bestimate%2Bspatial%2Bdistributions%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bbed%2Band%2Baquifer%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bfields%26rft.aufirst%3DAyman%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DAH%26rft.aulast%3DAlzraiee%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.11123%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DAlzraiee%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DBailey%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DBau%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.11123,"conductivity field inversion,data assimilation,stream-aquifer interaction","SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,TIME-SERIES,RIVER,FLOW,TEMPERATURE,SEEPAGE,HETEROGENEITY,DISCHARGE,DEPLETION",,"Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn 1372, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA"
36,36,"O'Briain, R",Mar 1 2022 ,Plants as agents of hydromorphological recovery in lowland streams,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"This applied study investigated the recovery trajectory of a channelized, lowland stream following removal of channel dredging and livestock grazing. Fine-scale relationships between macrophyte establishment and key physical descriptors (flow velocity, water depth and substrate) were analysed to explain channel adjustments and associated pioneer landform development. Through a process of biogeomorphic succession, macrophytes regulated the cohesiveness, erosion and transport of sediments, thereby affecting morphological responses and improving physical habitat diversity. The observations and analysis in this study capture the role of flow sediment-vegetation interactions in self-organisation of a lowland stream, and demonstrate how better understanding of this phenomenon may inform river management and restoration science. Coupled relationships between macrophyte succession, flow and sediment patterns promoted hydromorphological recovery and re naturalisation of the stream form. This dynamic was reflected in greater depth and substrate diversity characterised by increasing substrate coarseness and higher mean velocities. By regulating variations in local flow velocities, macrophytes created both low velocity-fine bed substrate and high velocity-coarser substrate habitat patches, and a range of shallow and deeper depth habitat patches. The process encouraged landform development on the channel margins and extension of the riverbank into the channel, thereby enhancing planform sinuosity as a two-stage channel formed. Such natural progression towards more heterogeneous habitat may sustain greater species diversity than artificially simplified rivers and deserves greater attention in restoration science.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that: (1) The degree of coupling coordination of the water resources-economy-ecosystem complex in the Henan section of the Yellow River basin showed an increasing trend that reached 0.8105 in 2019, which indicates good coordination; (2) The water resources subsystem had the greatest influence on the overall degree of coupling coordination, followed by the economic and natural environment subsystems; and (3) The SSA-BP model predicted that the degree of coupling coordination would remain good for the next six years and reach 0.8333 in 2025. To ensure the sustainability of expected rapid economic development, Henan Province must increase the utilization efficiency of water resources, strengthen environmental protection, and coordinate development in the region.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000895360200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Bcoordination%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bresources-economy-ecosystem%2Bcomplex%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHenan%2Bsection%2Bof%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2Bbasin%26rft.aufirst%3DShunsheng%26rft.auinit%3DSS%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fws.2022.410%26rft.eissn%3D1607-0798%26rft.epage%3D8848%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1606-9749%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BSUPPLY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D8835-8848%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D8835%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BSUPPLY%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BJY%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BTF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=WATER+SUPPLY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/ws.2022.410,"comprehensive evaluation,coupling coordination degree,grey relational analysis,Henan section of the Yellow River basin,SSA-BP combined model",,,"North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Water Conservancy, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China"

Bayesian inference is used to quantify the posterior uncertainty of parameters for a simple vertically heterogeneous aquifer model, in which the pumped semiconfined aquifer is separated by an aquiclude from a phreatic aquifer hydraulically connected to a stream. This study investigates the effects of using different data sets and shows that a single pumping test is generally not sufficient to determine stream depletion within reasonable limits. However, uncertainty quantification conducted within a Bayesian context reveals that by judicious design of aquifer tests, stream depletion can be accurately determined from data.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000334026600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUncertainty%2BQuantification%2Bfor%2BStream%2BDepletion%2BTests%26rft.aufirst%3DTiangang%26rft.auinit%3DTG%26rft.aulast%3DCui%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HE.1943-5584.0000695%26rft.eissn%3D1943-5584%26rft.epage%3D1590%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1084-0699%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1581-1590%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1581%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DCui%252C%2BTG%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BND&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000695,"Groundwater management,Rivers and streams,Pumps,Parameters,Bayesian analysis,Uncertainty principles,Markov process,Monte Carlo method,Groundwater,Pumping tests,Stream depletion,Parameter estimation,Bayesian inference,Uncertainty quantification,Markov chain Monte Carlo","ELECTRICAL-IMPEDANCE TOMOGRAPHY,OPTIMAL CURRENT PATTERNS,AQUIFER",,"Otago Computat Modelling Grp Ltd, POB 2, Kurow 9446, New Zealand"
39,39,"Bastow, JL",Apr 2002 ,A basal aquatic-terrestrial trophic link in rivers: algal subsidies via shore-dwelling grasshoppers,OECOLOGIA,"Rivers provide important resources for riparian consumers, especially in and or seasonally and biomes. Pygmy grasshoppers (Paratettix aztecus and R mexicanus: Tetrigidae) graze river algae stranded along shorelines of the South Fork Eel River in northern California (39degrees44'N, 123degrees39'W) as the river recedes during the summer drought. Densities of tetrigids during the mid to late summer were highest (1 individual/m(2) in July) within 1 m of the river margin, and declined to near zero at 4 m from the margin, especially during peak temperatures in the afternoon. These observations suggested that the distribution of tetrigids was determined by the availability of algae, water, or both. We manipulated the presence/absence of water and beached algae (Cladophora glomerata) in a 2x2 factorial design. All treatments were positioned 2 m upslope from the river's edge (about 30 cm above the water table), where the cobble bar was naturally dry and devoid of algae and densities of tetrigids were lower than at the river margin (0.4 individuals/m(2) in July). Tetrigids responded only to the wet Cladophora treatment, which had 30x higher densities than other treatments. Stable isotopic signatures (delta(13)C) of tetrigids (-19.7parts per thousand) collected from the same cobble bars were more similar to those of epilithic algae (-20.4parts per thousand) than terrestrial plants (-28.2parts per thousand), and higher than those of acridid grasshoppers (-27.9parts per thousand) from the same habitats. Mixing models suggest that 88-100% of the C in tetrigid grasshoppers at our study site is derived from riverine algae. A preliminary analysis suggests that tetrigids ingested sufficient quantities of algae to easily meet their energetic demands during the summer. This study supports the idea that algae, produced in stream systems. can determine the distribution and relative abundance of a common terrestrial scavenger and provide an additional pathway for energy exchange between rivers and riparian food webs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000175509700012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bbasal%2Baquatic-terrestrial%2Btrophic%2Blink%2Bin%2Brivers%253A%2Balgal%2Bsubsidies%2Bvia%2Bshore-dwelling%2Bgrasshoppers%26rft.aufirst%3DJL%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DBastow%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00442-002-0879-7%26rft.epage%3D268%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-8549%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DOECOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D261-268%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D261%26rft.stitle%3DOECOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D131%26rft.au%3DBastow%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DSabo%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DPower%252C%2BME&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=OECOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00442-002-0879-7,"subsidy,river-watershed exchange,tetrigidae,pygmy grasshopper,riparian","CARBON-ISOTOPE RATIOS,FOOD WEBS,STABLE ISOTOPES,ENERGY-FLOW,STREAM,ECOSYSTEM,MARINE,INVERTEBRATES,METABOLISM,ABSENCE",,"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Populat Biol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA"

The experimental design simulated groundwater-stream water mixing within sediment cores, which provided a well-defined one-dimensional representation of in situ hydrologic conditions. Two distinct hydrologic and chemical settings were preserved in the sediment cores: the lowermost sediments, perfused with groundwater, remained anaerobic during the incubations, whereas the uppermost sediments, perfused with oxic water pumped from the overlying water column, simulated stream water penetration into the bed. The maintenance of oxic and anoxic zones formed a biologically active aerobic-anaerobic interface. Ammonium (NF4+) dissolved in groundwater was transported conservatively through the lower core zone but was removed as it mixed with aerated recycle water. Concurrently, a small quantity of nitrate (NO3-) equaling similar to25% of the NH4+ loss was produced in the upper sediments. The NH4+ and NO3- profiles in the uppermost sediments resulted from coupled nitrification-denitrification, because assimilation and sorption were negligible. We hypothesize that anaerobic microsites within the aerated upper sediments supported denitrification. Rates of nitrification and denitrification in the perfusion cores ranged 42-209 and 53-160 mg N m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The use of modified perfusion cores permitted the identification and quantification of N transformations and verified process control by surface water exchange into the shallow hyporheic zone of the Shingobee River.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000182982300018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInorganic%2Bnitrogen%2Btransformations%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bbed%2Bof%2Bthe%2BShingobee%2BRiver%252C%2BMinnesota%253A%2BIntegrating%2Bhydrologic%2Band%2Bbiological%2Bprocesses%2Busing%2Bsediment%2Bperfusion%2Bcores%26rft.aufirst%3DRW%26rft.auinit%3DRW%26rft.aulast%3DSheibley%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.2003.48.3.1129%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D1140%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1129-1140%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1129%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DSheibley%252C%2BRW%26rft.au%3DDuff%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DTriska%252C%2BFJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.2003.48.3.1129,,"HYPORHEIC ZONE,NITRATE REDUCTION,ACETYLENE INHIBITION,MARINE SEDIMENT,DENITRIFICATION,NITRIFICATION,STREAM,WATER,OXYGEN,AMMONIA",,"Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA"
41,41,"Byu, SS",Feb 25 2008 ,Minimum DVS gateway deployment in DVS-based overlay streaming,COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS,"DVS (Distributed Video Streaming) is an edge streaming architecture for providing smooth video delivery. It is to divide video among multiple streaming senders in order to effectively provide the required throughput. In P2P-based streaming, if some peers are connected with high speed physical link, it is highly probable that they receive the best quality streaming stably from an original source. On these peers, we can impose the role of DVS gateway, i.e., let them translate the original streaming to distributive form and relay to the other peers who cannot connect to the original source with enough bandwidth. In dedicated infrastructure-based streaming, DVS gateway may be recruited by a content delivery company as an infrastructure node, that is to say, this infrastructure node has enough bandwidth to receive the best quality streaming from the original source, and it thus able to relay the original streaming using the distributed streaming to usual subscribers. In this paper, we consider a minimum DVS gateway deployment problem in DVS-based overlay streaming with satisfying bandwidth requirement of every peer or subscriber. We also consider the mandatory diversity and limitations of DVS gateways' streaming capacity. The mandatory diversity is beneficial to mitigate the degradation of quality when an available bandwidth decreases suddenly, and the streaming capacity of each DVS gateway may be limited and heterogeneous. Based on recent advances in modeling techniques in flow networks, we provide a mixed integer programming formulation of the minimum DVS gateway deployment problem, and show that this problem is NP-hard. Thus we propose Lagrangian Relaxation with reduction heuristic to obtain an approximated solution. Our theoretical simulation studies show that the results obtained by our method are close to the lower bound obtained using LP relaxation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Eight springs were investigated: four groundwater-fed springs in the floodplain, located at the bottom of the bank; and four interstitial-fed springs located at the downstream end of a gravel bar. During this period, the inflows of groundwater to the river represented an average input of 0.77 mg l(-1) of nitrogen (of which 93.3% were nitrates), 0.0187 mg l(-1) of total phosphorus (of which 42.2% was orthophosphate), 3.56 mg l(-1) of silica, 2.315 +/- 0.703 mg l(-1) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, of which 47% was biodegradable) and 7.3 x 10(4) +/- 3.7 x 10(4) bacteria per ml (of which 8.8% were active). Silica, DOC, biodegradable DOG, and bacteria concentrations displayed temporal variations during the study, which seem to be linked to the biological activity of the groundwater biofilm.

43,43,"Laaha, G",Dec 2013 ,Spatial Prediction of Stream Temperatures Using Top-Kriging with an External Drift,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT,"Top-kriging is a method for estimating stream flow and stream flow-related variables on a river network. Top-kriging treats these variables as emerging from a two-dimensional spatially continuous process in the landscape. The top-kriging weights are estimated by a family of variogram models (regularisations) for different catchment areas (kriging support), which accounts for the different scales and the nested nature of the catchments. This assures that kriging weights are distributed to both hydrologically connected and unconnected sites of the stream network according to the data situation: top-kriging gives most weight to close-by sites at the same river system, but when the next hydrologically connected site is far away, more weight is given to a close-by site at an adjacent river system. The distribution of weights is in contrast to ordinary kriging and stream distance-based kriging which does not account for both spatial proximity and network connectivity. We extend the top-kriging method by incorporating an external drift function to account for the deterministic patterns of the spatial variable. We test the method for a comprehensive Austrian stream temperature dataset. The drift is modelled by exponential regression with catchment altitude. Top-kriging is then applied to the regression residuals. The variogram used in top-kriging is fitted by a semiautomatic optimisation procedure. A leave-one-out cross-validation analysis shows that the model performs well for the study domain. The residual mean squared error (cross-validation) decreases by 20 % when using top-kriging in addition to the regression model. For regions where the observed stream temperatures deviate from the expected value of the drift model, top-kriging corrects these regional biases. By exploiting the topological information of the stream network, top-kriging is able to improve the local adjustment of the drift model for the main streams and the tributaries.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000326397400006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2BPrediction%2Bof%2BStream%2BTemperatures%2BUsing%2BTop-Kriging%2Bwith%2Ban%2BExternal%2BDrift%26rft.aufirst%3DGregor%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DLaaha%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10666-013-9373-3%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2967%26rft.epage%3D683%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1420-2026%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMODELING%2B%2526%2BASSESSMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D671-683%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D671%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMODEL%2BASSESS%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DLaaha%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DSkoien%252C%2BJO%26rft.au%3DBloschl%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MODELING+%26+ASSESSMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10666-013-9373-3,"Block kriging,Change of support,Geostatistics,Regionalisation,Spatial interpolation,Stream distance","RUNOFF,MODEL,FLOW,INTERPOLATION,COVARIANCE,NETWORKS,DISTANCE",,"Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, BOKU Vienna, Inst Appl Stat & Comp, A-1040 Vienna, Austria"
44,44,"Swan, CM",Oct 2017 ,Metacommunity theory meets restoration: isolation may mediate how ecological communities respond to stream restoration,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"An often-cited benefit of river restoration is an increase in biodiversity or shift in composition to more desirable taxa. Yet, hard manipulations of habitat structure often fail to elicit a significant response in terms of biodiversity patterns. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the dispersal of organisms may have as large an influence on biodiversity patterns as environmental conditions. This influence of dispersal may be particularly influential in river networks that are linear branching, or dendritic, and thus constrain most dispersal to the river corridor. As such, some locations in river networks, such as isolated headwaters, are expected to respond less to environmental factors and less by dispersal than more well-connected downstream reaches. We applied this metacommunity framework to study how restoration drives biodiversity patterns in river networks. By comparing assemblage structure in headwater vs. more well-connected mainstem sites, we learned that headwater restoration efforts supported higher biodiversity and exhibited more stable ecological communities compared with adjacent, unrestored reaches. Such differences were not evident in mainstem reaches. Consistent with theory and mounting empirical evidence, we attribute this finding to a relatively higher influence of dispersal-driven factors on assemblage structure in more well-connected, higher order reaches. An implication of this work is that, if biodiversity is to be a goal of restoration activity, such local manipulations of habitat should elicit a more profound response in small, isolated streams than in larger downstream reaches. These results offer another significant finding supporting the notion that restoration activity cannot proceed in isolation of larger-scale, catchment-level degradation.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000412080200016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMetacommunity%2Btheory%2Bmeets%2Brestoration%253A%2Bisolation%2Bmay%2Bmediate%2Bhow%2Becological%2Bcommunities%2Brespond%2Bto%2Bstream%2Brestoration%26rft.aufirst%3DChristopher%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DCM%26rft.aulast%3DSwan%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Feap.1602%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5582%26rft.epage%3D2219%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1051-0761%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2209-2219%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2209%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DSwan%252C%2BCM%26rft.au%3DBrown%252C%2BBL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/eap.1602,"biodiversity,isolation,metacommunity,restoration,river networks,stability","RESTORED RIVER REACHES,NETWORK STRUCTURE,MACROINVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY,DENDRITIC CONNECTIVITY,POPULATION PERSISTENCE,HABITAT HETEROGENEITY,HEADWATER STREAMS,BIODIVERSITY,DISPERSAL,URBANIZATION",,"Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Geog & Environm Syst, 211 Sondheim Hall,1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA"
45,45,"Hu, LT",Jul 1 2009 ,"Coupled surface water-groundwater model and its application in the Arid Shiyang River basin, China",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The planning and management of water resources in the Shiyang River basin, China require a tool for assessing the impact of groundwater and stream use on water supply reliabilities and improving many environment-related problems Such as soil desertification induced by recent water-related human activities. A Coupled model, integrating rule-based lumped surface water model and distributed three-dimensional groundwater flow model, has been established to investigate surface water and groundwater management scenarios that may be designed to restore the deteriorated ecological environment of the downstream portion of the Shiyang River basin. More than 66% of the water level among 24 observation wells have simulation error less than 1.0 m. The overall trend of the temporal changes of simulated and observed surface runoff at the Caiqi gauging station remains almost the same. The calibration was considered satisfactory. Initial frameworks for water allocation, including agricultural water-saving projects, water diversion within the basin and inter-basin water transfer, reducing agricultural irrigation area and surface water use instead of groundwater exploitation at the downstream were figured out that would provide a rational use of water resources throughout the whole basin. Sixteen scenarios were modelled to find out the most appropriate management strategies. The results showed that in the two selected management options, the groundwater budget at the Minqin basin was about 1.4 x 10(8) m(3)/a and the ecological environment Would be improved significantly, but the deficit existed at the Wuwei basin and the number was about 0.8 x 10(8) m(3)/a. Water demand for domestic, industry and urban green area Would be met in the next 30 years, but the water shortage for meeting the demand of agricultural water use in the Shiyang River basin was about 2.2 x 108 m(3)/a. It is suggested that more inter-basin water transfer should be required to obtain sustainable water resource use in the Shiyang River basin.

46,46,"Singkran, N",Mar 10 2007 ,"An abundance exchange model of fish assemblage response to changing habitat along embayment-stream gradients of Lake Ontario, New York",ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"A spatially explicit abundance exchange model (AEM) was developed to predict distribution patterns of five fish species in relation to their population characteristics and habitat preferences along two embayment-stream gradients associated with Lake Ontario, New York. The five fish species were yellow perch (Perca flavescens), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), logperch (Percina caprodes), bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus), and fantail darter (Etheostoma flabellare). Preference indexes of each target fish species for water depth, water temperature, current velocity, cover types (aquatic plants, algae, and woody debris), and bottom substrates (mud, sand, gravel-cobble, and rock-bedrock) were estimated from the field observations, and these were used to compute habitat preference (HP) of the associated fish species. Fish HP was a key variable in the AEM to quantify abundance exchange of an associated fish species among habitats on each study gradient. According to the results, the AEM efficiently determined local distribution ranges of the fish species on one study gradient. Results from the model validation showed that the AEM with its estimated parameters was able to quantify most of the fish species distributions on the second gradient. Overall, the AEM is rigorous for quantifying the distribution patterns of the target species along the changing habitat gradients. With its flexible structure that is applicable for array functions and differential equations from both static and dynamic components, the AEM can be modified to determine patterns of organism distribution in complex systems with different environments and geography (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

47,47,"Aljamal, MA",Aug 2020 ,Estimation of Traffic Stream Density Using Connected Vehicle Data: Linear and Nonlinear Filtering Approaches,SENSORS,"The paper presents a nonlinear filtering approach to estimate the traffic stream density on signalized approaches based solely on connected vehicle (CV) data. Specifically, a particle filter (PF) is developed to produce reliable traffic density estimates using CV travel-time measurements. Traffic flow continuity is used to derive the state equation, whereas the measurement equation is derived from the hydrodynamic traffic flow relationship. Subsequently, the PF filtering approach is compared to linear estimation approaches; namely, a Kalman filter (KF) and an adaptive KF (AKF). Simulated data are used to evaluate the performance of the three estimation techniques on a signalized approach experiencing oversaturated conditions. Results demonstrate that the three techniques produce accurate estimates-with the KF, surprisingly, being the most accurate of the three techniques. A sensitivity of the estimation techniques to various factors including the CV level of market penetration, the initial conditions, and the number of particles in the PF is also presented. As expected, the study demonstrates that the accuracy of the PF estimation increases as the number of particles increases. Furthermore, the accuracy of the density estimate increases as the level of CV market penetration increases. The results indicate that the KF is least sensitive to the initial vehicle count estimate, while the PF is most sensitive to the initial condition. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that a simple linear estimation approach is best suited for the proposed application.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000558992100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B4066%26rft.atitle%3DEstimation%2Bof%2BTraffic%2BStream%2BDensity%2BUsing%2BConnected%2BVehicle%2BData%253A%2BLinear%2Band%2BNonlinear%2BFiltering%2BApproaches%26rft.aufirst%3DMohammad%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DAljamal%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fs20154066%26rft.eissn%3D1424-8220%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D15%26rft.jtitle%3DSENSORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSENSORS-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DAljamal%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DAbdelghaffar%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DRakha%252C%2BHA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=SENSORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/s20154066,"traffic density,connected vehicles,real-time estimation,particle filter,Kalman filter","PARTICLE FILTER,KALMAN FILTER,PREDICTION",,"Virginia Tech, Transportat Inst, Charles E Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ctr Sustainable Mobil, Charles & Via, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
48,48,"Adams, RK",Nov 2005 ,The form and function of headwater streams based on field and modeling investigations in the Southern Appalachian Mountains,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Headwater streams drain the majority of most landscapes, yet less is known about their morphology and sediment transport processes than for lowland rivers. We have studied headwater channel form, discharge and erosive power in the humid, moderate-relief Valley and Ridge and Blue Ridge provinces of the Appalachian Mountains. Field observations from nine headwater (< 2 km(2) drainage area), mixed bedrock-alluvial channels in a variety of boundary conditions demonstrate variation with respect to slope-area channel initiation, basic morphology, slope distribution, hydraulic geometry, substrate grain size and role of woody debris. These channels display only some of the typical downstream trends expected or larger, lowland rivers. Variations are controlled mainly by differences in bedrock resistance, from the formation level down to short-wavelength, outcrop-scale variations. Hydrologic modeling on these ungauged channels estimates the recurrence of channel-filling discharge and its ability to erode the channel bed. Two-year recurrence discharge is generally larger and closer to bankroll height in the Valley and Ridge, due to low soil infiltration capacity. Discharge that fills the channel to its surveyed bankroll form is variable, generally exceeding two-year flows at small drainage areas (< 0.5 km(2)) and being exceeded by them at greater drainage areas. This suggests bankfull is not controlled by the same recurrence storm throughout a channel or physiographic region. Stream power and relative competence are also variable. These heterogeneities contrast relations observed in larger streams and illustrate the sensitivity of headwater channels to local knickpoints or resistant bedrock and armoring of channels by influx of coarse debris from hillslopes. The general lack of predictable trends or functional relationships among hydraulic variables and the close coupling of channel form and function with local boundarv conditions indicate that headwater streams pose a significant challenge to landscape evolution modeling.

49,49,"Pan, F",Dec 2019 ,Kinetic Exchange of Remobilized Phosphorus Related to Phosphorus-Iron-Sulfur Biogeochemical Coupling in Coastal Sediment,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Phosphorus (P) cycling in coastal sediment can be strongly coupled to iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) geochemical transformations. In this study, the high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques were employed to synchronously characterize the in situ P-Fe-S biogeochemistry in coastal sediments around Xiamen Bay, China. The results show that P remobilization is mainly controlled by dissimilatory Fe reduction in the Jiulong River Estuary (JE) and the eastern coast of Xiamen Bay (EX), while it is dominated by sulfate reduction in the Jiuxi River Estuary. The confined oxidizing depth and the higher DGT-labile S and soluble Fe (II) concentrations in October indicate that the hypoxia induced by tides and river runoff has a greater effect on sulfate reduction and Fe reduction than high temperatures in July, which accelerate P remobilization and exchange flux. Model simulations of the P resupply and adsorption/desorption kinetics demonstrate that the enhancement of Fe reduction and sulfate reduction triggered by hypoxia promotes the continuous release of P. Both DGT-labile P and S presented distinct distribution patterns in crab burrows during flood tide and ebb tide. A negative P exchange flux to the overlying water controlled by Fe (III) retention at JE and a positive P exchange flux controlled by intense sulfate reduction at EX were observed, both of which were significantly higher than the molecular diffusion flux. We suggest that internal P loading related to Fe and S redox geochemistry should receive more attention, especially in the context of expanding global marine hypoxia.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000501670200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DKinetic%2BExchange%2Bof%2BRemobilized%2BPhosphorus%2BRelated%2Bto%2BPhosphorus-Iron-Sulfur%2BBiogeochemical%2BCoupling%2Bin%2BCoastal%2BSediment%26rft.aufirst%3DFeng%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DPan%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025941%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D10517%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D10494-10517%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D10494%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DPan%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DGuo%252C%2BZR%26rft.au%3DGao%252C%2BAG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39wzyqtfIIWGIcbaoCp1i&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR025941,"phosphorus remobilization,phosphorus exchange flux,iron reduction,sulfate reduction,crab burrow,biogeochemistry","DISSOLVED REACTIVE PHOSPHORUS,PORE-WATER,IN-SITU,DIFFUSIVE GRADIENTS,THIN-FILMS,SULFATE REDUCTION,SOLUTE FLUXES,FERROUS IRON,BALTIC SEA,PHOSPHATE",,"Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China"
