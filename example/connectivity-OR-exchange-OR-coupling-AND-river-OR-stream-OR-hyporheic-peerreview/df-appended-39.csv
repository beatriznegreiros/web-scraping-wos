0,0,"Shimizu, Y",Aug 2020 ,Effect of in-stream impoundment on water quality of a suburban stream,LIMNOLOGY,"This study aims to confirm the effect of a small stream impoundment on phosphorus and nitrogen dynamics in a suburban watershed. The results show that the phosphate concentration in the water body was significantly higher than that in the inflowing water under ordinary flow conditions. The phosphorus promotes algal growth that causes significant diurnal dissolved oxygen variation because of photosynthesis and respiration. The phosphate exchange between the sediment and overlying water was mainly controlled by diffusion flux rather than by advective flux seepage because of large amounts of phosphorus accumulated on the surface of the sediment. When a flood occurs, the phosphorus-enriched water is flushed downstream by rain-swollen currents. In summary, an impoundment affects in-stream phosphorus concentration through organic matter degradation and the release of phosphate in the sediment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000528319900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Bin-stream%2Bimpoundment%2Bon%2Bwater%2Bquality%2Bof%2Ba%2Bsuburban%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DYuta%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DShimizu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10201-020-00619-x%26rft.eissn%3D1439-863X%26rft.epage%3D402%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1439-8621%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D393-402%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D393%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DShimizu%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DOnodera%252C%2BSI%26rft.au%3DSaito%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10201-020-00619-x,"Phosphorus,In-stream impoundment,Retention,Suburban watershed","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER,KARST TEST-SITE,LAKE-SEDIMENTS,PHOTOCHEMICAL RELEASE,PHOSPHORUS RELEASE,DIURNAL-VARIATIONS,TROPHIC STATE,LAND-USES,NITROGEN,NUTRIENTS",,"Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Western Reg Agr Res Ctr, 6-12-1 Nishi Fukatsu, Fukuyama, Hiroshima 7218514, Japan"

Knowledge of coupled cycling of N, P and organic C in flowing freshwaters is essential to understanding and predicting aquatic ecosystems responses to environmental change comprising multiple chemical and physical stressors. Colonisation on nutrient diffusing substrates (glucose-C, inorganic NP, combined CNP and control applied in-situ in an oligotrophic, upland stream) led to biofilms differing in community and element compositions. The 72 biofilms were transferred to replicated recirculating water chambers (1 L volume) for 4-days where additional effects of light and temperature treatments were investigated on nutrient exchange with the water column. Chemical (nutrient analyses, C-13, N-15 tracing, stoichiometry) and biological (chlorophyll, TRFLP) analyses were performed to understand the biofilm composition changes and interaction with the water column. Biofilms combining C with NP incorporated more N and P relative to controls than did those with NP alone. During the chamber phase C-treated biofilms resulted in lower water column N, P concentrations with CNP relative to NP treatments. The effects of the light and temperature were manifested mainly in impaired net nutrient uptake at temperature deviating from ambient stream temperatures. The effects of organic C on N, P cycling (and vice-versa) in mixed biofilms and their interaction with waters is a developing field. Combining in-stream and chamber tests has shown potential for studying in controlled and replicated systems such complex interactions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

2,2,"Deng, ZQ",May 2009 ,Scaling dispersion model for pollutant transport in rivers,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"This communication presents a scale-dependent model, called Scaling Dispersion (SD) Model, for simulating solute dispersion and transport in rivers without using a user-specified residence time distribution function. The SD model consists of (1) the advection dispersion equation with a transient storage term which is characterized by a variable residence time, (2) a new method for estimation of the longitudinal Fickian dispersion coefficient involved in the model, and (3) a split-operator method for numerical solution of the equations involved in the model. Comparisons between the SD model and the most widely used transient storage model against tracer test data observed in three US rivers show that the SD model is capable of simulating different types of residence time distributions commonly observed in streams with an accuracy higher than or at least comparable with existing solute transport models, demonstrating the efficacy of the SD model. The SD model unifies the residence time distributions observed in natural rivers within a single modelling framework for the first time. The SD model provides an efficient and cost effective tool for predicting solute dispersion and transport in streams and rivers. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The system was operated with variable speed-peristaltic pumps by manipulating electromagnetic relays and a timer. Water vapor in the hydride gas was removed by inserting a glass trap immersed in an ice bath. Interference with transition matals was eliminated by using Chelex 100 resin. The detection limits (3 times the signal-to-noise ratio) of arsenic and selenium are 0.03 and 0.06 ng/ml, respectively, at a resolution of 10000. The accuracies checked with biological standard reference materials obtained from the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), USA, and the National Research Council(NRC), Canada, were within the certified values.

4,4,"St-Laurent, P",Dec 1 2011 ,What is the fate of the river waters of Hudson Bay?,JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,"We examine the freshwater balance of Hudson and James bays, two shallow and fresh seas that annually receive 12% of the pan-Arctic river runoff. The analyses use the results from a 3-D sea ice-ocean coupled model with realistic forcing for tides, rivers, ocean boundaries, precipitation, and winds. The model simulations show that the annual freshwater balance is essentially between the river input and a large outflow toward the Labrador shelf. River waters are seasonally exchanged from the nearshore region to the interior of the basin, and the volumes exchanged are substantial (of the same order of magnitude as the annual river input). This lateral exchange is mostly caused by Ekman transport, and its magnitude and variability are controlled by the curl of the stress at the surface of the basin. The average transit time of the river waters is 3.0 years, meaning that the outflow is a complex mixture of the runoff from the three preceding years. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a novel framework employing stratified bagging for training base classifiers to integrate data preprocessing and dynamic ensemble selection methods for imbalanced data stream classification. The proposed approach has been evaluated based on computer experiments carried out on 135 artificially generated data streams with various imbalance ratios, label noise levels, and types of concept drift as well as on two selected real streams. Four preprocessing techniques and two dynamic selection methods, used on both bagging classifiers and base estimators levels, were considered.

Nevertheless, existing numerical models have shortages in accuracy, efficiency and revealing potential relationships. Thus, for providing an accurate and efficient statistical model as a fundamental tool for investigating the effects of changing environment on the YPRLS, we developed the Yangtze-Poyang water exchange statistic (YPWES) model. In this study, the YPWES model was employed to simulate the water exchange in the YPRLS from 1971 to 2016 and improve our understanding of the backflow from the river to lake (BRL) in the YPRLS.New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Based on a physic-based lumped framework, the established YPWES model is basically more accurate and efficient than nine existing models. Meanwhile, 93% of the BRL event will occur when the value of discharge identification function (DIF) is 9.2-10.0 m, while the threshold range of the DIF corresponding to the BRL event occurrence was smaller after 2003 because the discharge-stage relationship changes with the Yangtze River streamflow when the BRL event occurs.

This spatial and temporal variability is intimately linked to the conditions at the base of the ice streams and the distribution of localised patches of basal friction, known as 'sticky spots'. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of sticky spot observations from both contemporary and palaeo-ice stream beds in order to better understand their nature and influence. Observations and theoretical considerations reveal four primary causes of 'stickiness': (i), bedrock bumps; (ii), till-free areas; (iii), areas of 'strong' (well drained) till; and (iv), freeze-on of subglacial meltwater. These may act together in one location, or in isolation; and a progressive increase in their distribution could lead to ice stream shut-down. Bedrock bumps are influential under active ice streams, where they provide form drag and can create thinner ice which increases the likelihood of basal freeze-on. Increased bed roughness may prevent the lateral migration of some ice streams but bedrock bumps are unlikely to cause ice stream shut-down because, over long time-scales, ice stream erosion might be expected to reduce their amplitude. The influence of till-free areas beneath an ice stream will depend critically on the amount of water that might be drawn out of the surrounding till to lubricate such areas. They are likely to be most important in ice stream onset zones but their identification has proved difficult beneath active ice streams. If an ice stream operates solely by till deformation, it is conceivable that a progressive increase in the exposure of till-free areas could lead to shut-down through a process of sediment exhaustion. Areas of strong, well drained till have been identified beneath both active and ancient ice streams and are most likely to result from the reorganisation of subglacial meltwater. The collapse of an inefficient 'cannalised' system to a more efficient 'channelised' system can occur rapidly and this mechanism has been hypothesised as a candidate for ice stream shut-down in both contemporary and palaeo-settings. Basal freeze-on has also been observed and inferred from beneath modem and palaeo-ice streams, and a reduction in basal meltwater supply coupled with ice stream drawdown and the advection of cold ice increases the likelihood of switching off an ice stream. A paucity of data from ice stream sticky spots limits a better understanding of their nature, distribution and evolution beneath ice streams. Future technological advances are likely to improve the resolution of the data collected from the beds of modem ice streams but well-preserved palaeo-ice stream beds also hold potential for investigating their influence on ice stream flow and we present simple landsystems models to aid their identification. Such data will considerably enhance the basal boundary condition in ice stream models which will, ultimately, refine our predictions of the response of contemporary ice sheets to future changes in climate.

9,9,"Williams, DD",Dec 1 2003 ,The brackishwater hyporheic zone: invertebrate community structure across a novel ecotone,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"This study describes a hyporheic zone that exists beneath a river-dominated estuary in North Wales, and which spans the fresh water/saltwater boundary. A series of 72 cores was taken from the Aber Estuary, in September, at depths from 10-60 cm below the bed surface. Site 1 was above the extreme high water mark and therefore was never inundated by salt water. Site 5 was the furthest downstream and was inundated twice daily by incoming tides. Substrates contained more gravel at the upstream sites and closer to the bed surface, with more sand and silt at downstream sites and at depth. Salinity of interstitial water increased both with distance away from Site 1 and with increasing depth into the zone, reaching a maximum of 15%o at 60 cm at Site 5, as measured at low tide. Longitudinal and vertical zonations of the invertebrate taxa were evident, and densities were greater in the top 40 cm than below. Nematodes were especially abundant from 10-60 cm, and genera differed along the estuary. Oligochaetes were well represented at most sites, with the less saline sites yielding Naididae, Enchytraeidae, Aeolosomatidae and Tubificidae; Site 5 was dominated by Tubifex costatus. Chironomid larvae were most abundant to 40 cm at Sites 1 and 2 (primarily Brillia modesta, Corynoneura sp., Tanytarsus sp., and unidentified Tanypodinae), but they were also found at Site 3 (to 60 cm), and at 10 cm at Site 5 (Orthocladius sp.). Nymphs of mayflies and caddisfly larvae were found primarily at Site 1, but small stonefly nymphs and elmid beetle larvae were taken at Site 2 depths where the interstitial water was brackish. The most saline sediments were populated by the triclad Uteriporus vulgaris, the polychaete Nereis sp., and snails (Hydrobia sp.). Site, salinity, pH, and sand and silt contents appeared to influence species distribution most; together, these explained 37.8% of the variance (CANOCO). There was an overall negative relationship between silt content of the sediments and total invertebrate density. The hyporheic zone of the Aber Estuary is thus not only influenced by surface water and, presumably, estuarine groundwater exchanges, but is further complicated, biologically, by having a salinity gradient running through it. The term 'brackishwater hyporheic zone' (BHZ) is proposed to describe this and similar systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000188455700015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bbrackishwater%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2Binvertebrate%2Bcommunity%2Bstructure%2Bacross%2Ba%2Bnovel%2Becotone%26rft.aufirst%3DDD%26rft.auinit%3DDD%26rft.aulast%3DWilliams%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FB%253AHYDR.0000008642.64116.8f%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D173%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1-3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D153-173%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D153%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D510&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008642.64116.8f,,"TIDAL FRESH-WATER,VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION,ESTUARIES,DYNAMICS,MARINE,OXYGEN,NEMATODES,MEIOFAUNA,COPEPODA,ECOLOGY",,"Univ Toronto, Div Life Sci, Surface & Groundwater Ecol Res Grp, 1265 Mil Trail, Scarborough, ON M1C 1A4, Canada"
10,10,"Manning, AH",Oct 2022 ,Incorporating streambank wells in stream mass loading studies to more effectively identify sources of solutes in stream water,APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"Stream synoptic sampling studies that include flow estimates derived from the stream tracer dilution method are now commonly performed to identify sources and processes controlling solute transport to streams. However, a limitation of this mass-loading approach is its inability to identify the side of the stream on which a source is located in the common case where loading is largely from groundwater discharge. Such bank-specific loading information can be particularly valuable at mining-affected sites where both mining-related and natural back-ground metal sources are often closely intermingled. Here we combine the stream mass-loading approach with data from pairs of shallow hand-installed streambank wells located on opposite sides of a gaining metal-impacted headwater stream to estimate bank-specific metal loading rates. Study results successfully identify a right-bank zone in the upper half of the primary study reach as the dominant source of loading, where groundwater discharge is elevated in metals due to natural weathering of sulfide-rich bedrock. A left-bank zone in the lower half of the primary study reach was also identified as a secondary, yet still substantial, loading source, where groundwater is likely impacted by portal discharge and/or waste piles associated with an adjacent abandoned mine. Determining the dominance of the left-bank mining-related source compared to other potential right-bank natural sulfide weathering sources would not have been possible without the streambank wells. Streambank wells also enabled collection of dissolved gas samples for groundwater dating. Computed piston-flow 3H/3He groundwater ages show little to no correlation with either metal concentrations or loading rates, suggesting that groundwater residence time and flow path variations exert little influence on groundwater discharge chemistry compared to variations in bedrock and soil composition. This study thus provides proof of concept that the proposed method of combining streambank well data with stream tracer injection and synoptic sampling can provide useful information on bank-specific mass loading rates and sources of contaminants affecting stream water quality.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000862847900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B105425%26rft.atitle%3DIncorporating%2Bstreambank%2Bwells%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bmass%2Bloading%2Bstudies%2Bto%2Bmore%2Beffectively%2Bidentify%2Bsources%2Bof%2Bsolutes%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bwater%26rft.aufirst%3DAndrew%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DAH%26rft.aulast%3DManning%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.apgeochem.2022.105425%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9134%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0883-2927%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BGEOCHEM%26rft.volume%3D145%26rft.au%3DManning%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DRunkel%252C%2BRL%26rft.au%3DWalton-Day%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+GEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105425,"Stream mass loading,Abandoned mines,Stream metal contamination,Groundwater surface-water interaction,Groundwater age","TRACER-INJECTION,HYPORHEIC ZONE,CREEK,DYNAMICS,EXCHANGE,MOUNTAINS,DRAINAGE,NITROGEN,ZINC",,"US Geol Survey, POB 25046, MS 973, Denver, CO 80225 USA"
11,11,"Samia, Y",Mar 2017 ,Downstream flow and upstream movement determine the value of a stream reach for potadromous fish populations,THEORETICAL ECOLOGY,"Given that human activities often have negative impacts on biological populations, a common question is to find the location of greatest positive or least negative impact. Local habitat suitability is frequently used to evaluate viability of fish populations in river networks. Upper stream reaches are often undervalued, in particular when they are not navigable or do not contain commercially interesting fish. Since water flow transports certain local conditions downstream and individuals navigate river networks upstream and downstream, impacts of local perturbations can manifest elsewhere in the system, and overall effects of disturbances should be assessed on a network level. We study a model for a potadromous fish population in a system of connected stream reaches. We consider different geometries to evaluate how downstream transport and individual movement interact to determine the location of greatest and least impact of a single or two concurrent disturbances. Our results show how upper stream reaches can be highly significant for population persistence if downstream transport of abiotic conditions or upstream movement of individuals is strong.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000397924000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDownstream%2Bflow%2Band%2Bupstream%2Bmovement%2Bdetermine%2Bthe%2Bvalue%2Bof%2Ba%2Bstream%2Breach%2Bfor%2Bpotadromous%2Bfish%2Bpopulations%26rft.aufirst%3DYasmine%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DSamia%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12080-016-0306-z%26rft.eissn%3D1874-1746%26rft.epage%3D34%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1874-1738%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DTHEORETICAL%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D21-34%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D21%26rft.stitle%3DTHEOR%2BECOL-NETH%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DSamia%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DLutscher%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=THEORETICAL+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12080-016-0306-z,"River network,Population persistence,Disturbance,Cumulative effects,Metapopulation model","ARBORESCENT RIVER NETWORK,GROWTH-RATE,DYNAMICS,PERSISTENCE,FRAGMENTATION,RISK",,"Univ Ottawa, Dept Math & Stat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada"
12,12,"Holmes, RM",Dec 1998 ,The impact of flash floods on microbial distribution and biogeochemistry in the parafluvial zone of a desert stream.,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The impact of flash flooding on microbial distribution and biogeochemistry was investigated in the parafluvial zone (the part of the active channel lateral to the surface stream) of Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran Desert stream in central Arizona.2. It was hypothesized that subsurface bacteria were dependent on the import of algal-derived organic matter from the surface stream, and it was therefore predicted that microbial numbers and rates of microbially mediated processes would be highest at locations of surface to subsurface hydrologic exchange and at times when algal biomass was high.3. Prior to a flash flood on 19 July 1994, chlorophyll a was high (approximate to 400 mg m(-2)) in the surface stream and microbial numbers were highest at the stream-parafluvial interface and declined along parafluvial flowpaths, supporting the hypothesized algal-bacterial linkage. Immediately following the flash flood, chlorophyll a was low (approximate to 7mgm(-2)), and microbial numbers were reduced at the stream-parafluvial interface.4. Counter to expectations, parafluvial functioning (in terms of nitrate production and dissolved oxygen decline along flowpaths) re-established immediately after the flood receded. Therefore, material other than algal exudates supported parafluvial metabolism immediately postflood, and terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter is the likely source.5. Algae in the surface stream recovered quickly following flooding, but recovery of parafluvial bacteria lagged somewhat behind. These results highlight the importance of surface-subsurface interaction to stream ecosystem functioning and show that the nature of these interactions changes substantially in successional time.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000077818600005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bimpact%2Bof%2Bflash%2Bfloods%2Bon%2Bmicrobial%2Bdistribution%2Band%2Bbiogeochemistry%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bparafluvial%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bdesert%2Bstream.%26rft.aufirst%3DRM%26rft.auinit%3DRM%26rft.aulast%3DHolmes%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.1998.00362.x%26rft.epage%3D654%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D641-654%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D641%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DHolmes%252C%2BRM%26rft.au%3DFisher%252C%2BSG%26rft.au%3DHarper%252C%2BBJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00362.x,"disturbance,floods,hyporheic zone,nitrification,nutrient cycling,parafluvial zone","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,ECOSYSTEM,WATER,SEDIMENTS,BACTERIA,SUCCESSION,DENITRIFICATION",,"Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA"

However, there are very few models that can represent the coevolution of water, ecology and socioeconomic system at the river basin scale. In this study, a watershed system model was developed using the case of the Heihe River basin (HRB), a typical endorheic river basin in Northwest China. The model is mainly composed of an integrated ecohydrological model, a socioeconomic model, and two interface models. It has been embedded into a decision support system using the surrogate modeling technique. The watershed system model proved to be reliable in simulating multiple eco-hydrological processes, and showed good abilities in exploring the trajectories and interactions of water, ecology and socioeconomy.

14,14,"Deirmendjian, L",Mar 2018 ,Carbon dioxide degassing at the groundwater-stream-atmosphere interface: isotopic equilibration and hydrological mass balance in a sandy watershed,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Streams and rivers emit significant amounts of CO2 and constitute a preferential pathway of carbon transport from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere. However, the estimation of CO2 degassing based on the water-air CO2 gradient, gas transfer velocity and stream surface area is subject to large uncertainties. Furthermore, the stable isotope signature of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13-DIC) in streams is strongly impacted by gas exchange, which makes it a useful tracer of CO2 degassing under specific conditions. For this study, we characterized the annual transfers of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) along the groundwater-stream-river continuum based on DIC concentrations, stable isotope composition and measurements of stream discharges. We selected a homogeneous, forested and sandy lowland watershed as a study site, where the hydrology occurs almost exclusively through drainage of shallow groundwater (no surface runoff). We observed the first general spatial pattern of decreases in pCO(2) and DIC and an increase in delta C-13-DIC from groundwater to stream orders 1 and 2, which was due to the experimentally verified faster degassing of groundwater C-12-DIC compared to C-13-DIC. This downstream enrichment in C-13-DIC could be modelled by simply considering the isotopic equilibration of groundwater-derived DIC with the atmosphere during CO2 degassing. A second spatial pattern occurred between stream orders 2 and 4, consisting of an increase in the proportion of carbonate alkalinity to the DIC accompanied by the enrichment of C-13 in the stream DIC, which was due to the occurrence of carbonate rock weathering downstream. We could separate the contribution of these two processes (gas exchange and carbonate weathering) in the stable isotope budget of the river network. Thereafter, we built a hydrological mass balance based on drainages and the relative contribution of groundwater in streams of increasing order. After combining with the dissolved CO2 concentrations, we quantified CO2 degassing for each stream order for the whole watershed. Approximately 75% of the total CO2 degassing from the watershed occurred in first- and second-order streams. Furthermore, from stream order 2-4, our CO2 degassing fluxes compared well with those based on stream hydraulic geometry, water pCO(2), gas transfer velocity, and stream surface area. In first-order streams, however, our approach showed CO2 fluxes that were twice as large, suggesting that a fraction of degassing occurred as hotspots in the vicinity of groundwater resurgence and was missed by conventional stream sampling.

15,15,"Hong, B",2016 ,Characteristics of vertical exchange process in the Pearl River estuary,AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT,"Being an estuary with the occasional appearance of hypoxia, the Pearl River estuary was selected to investigate its vertical exchange process by a validated 3-D numerical model. The concept of vertical exchange time was used to quantify the vertical exchange process and was calculated by adding a conservative tracer to the hydrodynamic model. The results revealed vertical exchange time has significant seasonal variation modulated by seasonally changed external forcing, and has similar structure with spatial variation in salinity. During the wet season, remarkably long vertical exchange times (>50 days) occurred at the lower estuary under 10 m depth, which was coincident with the frequently reported hypoxic zone. The entire Pearl River estuary was occupied by water mass with a vertical exchange time of <5 days during the dry season, which indicated the estuary's health condition during this period. Further analyses revealed the seasonal trend of vertical exchange time was closely related with salinity stratification and river runoff in which the lowest vertical exchange times can be estimated by linear regressions in certain stages. Tide modulated these exchange times in different time scales. Spring tide better mixed the water column and thus facilitated the vertical exchange process compared with neap tide. As a result, minimum vertical exchange time during spring tide was about 10 days shorter than that during neap tide. Flood-ebb tide also modulated vertical exchange time in the Pearl River estuary. Vertical exchange time varies with the tide and reached minimum and maximum values during valley and high tides, respectively.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000383372800008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCharacteristics%2Bof%2Bvertical%2Bexchange%2Bprocess%2Bin%2Bthe%2BPearl%2BRiver%2Bestuary%26rft.aufirst%3DBo%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DHong%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F14634988.2016.1205438%26rft.eissn%3D1539-4077%26rft.epage%3D295%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1463-4988%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BECOSYSTEM%2BHEALTH%2B%2526%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D286-295%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D286%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BECOSYST%2BHEALTH%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DHong%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DGong%252C%2BWP%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BHZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+ECOSYSTEM+HEALTH+%26+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/14634988.2016.1205438,"transport timescale,estuary circulation,stratification","ADJACENT COASTAL WATERS,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN,CHESAPEAKE BAY,SHALLOW ESTUARY,HYPOXIA,MODEL,AGE,VARIABILITY,CHINA,STRATIFICATION",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Sanya 572000, Peoples R China"

Therefore, changes in ice stream flow are key to understanding paleoclimate, sea level changes, and rapid disintegration of ice sheets during deglaciation. The dynamics of ice flow are tightly coupled to the climate system through atmospheric temperature and snow recharge, which are known exhibit stochastic variability. Here we focus on the interplay between stochastic climate forcing and ice stream temporal dynamics. Our work demonstrates that realistic climate fluctuations are able to (i) induce the coexistence of dynamic behaviors that would be incompatible in a purely deterministic system and (ii) drive ice stream flow away from the regime expected in a steady climate. We conclude that environmental noise appears to be crucial to interpreting the past behavior of ice sheets, as well as to predicting their future evolution.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000381293300006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStochastic%2Bice%2Bstream%2Bdynamics%26rft.aufirst%3DElisa%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DMantelli%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1073%252Fpnas.1600362113%26rft.epage%3DE4600%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0027-8424%26rft.issue%3D32%26rft.jtitle%3DPROCEEDINGS%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNATIONAL%2BACADEMY%2BOF%2BSCIENCES%2BOF%2BTHE%2BUNITED%2BSTATES%2BOF%2BAMERICA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3DE4594-E4600%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3DE4594%26rft.stitle%3DP%2BNATL%2BACAD%2BSCI%2BUSA%26rft.volume%3D113%26rft.au%3DMantelli%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DBertagni%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DRidolfi%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=PROCEEDINGS+OF+THE+NATIONAL+ACADEMY+OF+SCIENCES+OF+THE+UNITED+STATES+OF+AMERICA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1073/pnas.1600362113,"ice streams,noise-induced phenomena,climate variability,Hopf bifurcation","ATLANTICS HEINRICH EVENTS,WEST ANTARCTICA,SUBGLACIAL HYDROLOGY,BASAL MECHANICS,WATER-SYSTEM,SIPLE COAST,VARIABILITY,SHEET,FLOW,GLACIER",,"Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, I-10129 Turin, Italy"
17,17,"Beeson, HW",Oct 1 2017 ,Geometric disequilibrium of river basins produces long-lived transient landscapes,EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS,"Although equilibrium has long been considered the attractor state for landscapes, the time required to reach equilibrium or even the possibility of reaching equilibrium is still debated. Using Be-10-based catchment-averaged denudation rates, topographic analysis, and analysis of the basin topology and geometry, including its area-channel length scaling relationship, we show that an ancient postorogenic dome on the North American Craton, the Ozark dome, is not in a state of equilibrium. The persistent state of disequilibrium on the Ozark dome is characterized by nonuniform erosion rates that vary by a factor of three, asymmetric drainage divides, and evidence for drainage rearrangement via stream capture. We find that planform geometric disequilibrium of river basins and drainage area exchange between adjoining basins can hold river networks in a disequilibrium state for potentially hundreds of million years and that, when sustained over time, erosion rate differences associated with drainage area exchange can lead to transient events such as stream capture and production of relief in the form of elevated, low-relief surfaces. Our results suggest that landscapes with slowly moving drainage divides might not reach equilibrium, and that river basin dynamics may contribute to setting the large-scale morphology of old cratonic landscapes.

18,18,"Malki, R",Mar 2014 ,Planning tidal stream turbine array layouts using a coupled blade element momentum - computational fluid dynamics model,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"A coupled blade element momentum computational fluid dynamics (BEM-CFD) model is used to conduct simulations of groups of tidal stream turbines. Simulations of single, double and triple turbine arrangements are conducted first to evaluate the effects of turbine spacing and arrangement on flow dynamics and rotor performance. Wake recovery to free-stream conditions was independent of flow velocity. Trends identified include significant improvement of performance for the downstream rotor where longitudinal spacing between a longitudinally aligned pair is maximised, whereas maintaining a lateral spacing between two devices of two diameters or greater increases the potential of benefitting from flow acceleration between them. This could significantly improve the performance of a downstream device, particularly where the longitudinal spacing between the two rows is two diameters or less. Due to the computational efficiency of this modelling approach, particularly when compared to transient computational fluid dynamics simulations of rotating blades, the BEM-CFD model can simulate larger numbers of devices. An example of how an understanding of the hydrodynamics around devices is affected by rotor spacing can be used to optimise the performance of a 14 turbine array is presented. Compared to a regular staggered configuration, the total power output of the array was increased by over 10%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

19,19,"Liu, JG",Feb 2004 ,High order finite difference methods for unsteady incompressible flows in multi-connected domains,COMPUTERS & FLUIDS,"Using the vorticity and stream function variables is an effective way to compute 2-D incompressible flow due to the facts that the incompressibility constraint for the velocity is automatically satisfied, the pressure variable is eliminated, and high order schemes can be efficiently implemented. However, a difficulty arises in a multi-connected computational domain in determining the constants for the stream function on the boundary of the ""holes"". This is an especially challenging task for the calculation of unsteady flows, since these constants vary with time to reflect the total fluxes of the flow in each sub-channel. In this paper, we propose an efficient method in a finite difference setting to solve this problem and present some numerical experiments, including an accuracy check of a Taylor vortex-type flow, flow past a non-symmetric square, and flow in a heat exchanger.

20,20,"Ward, JV",Nov-dec 2001 ,Understanding natural patterns and processes in river corridors as the basis for effective river restoration,REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT,"Running water ecology is a young science, the conceptual foundations of which were derived largely from research conducted in Europe and North America. However, virtually all European river corridors were substantially regulated well before the science of river ecology developed. While regulation of North American river systems occurred later than in European systems, river ecology also developed later. Therefore, there is a general impression of rivers as being much less heterogeneous and much more stable than they actually are in the natural state. The thesis of this paper is that established research and management concepts may fail to fully recognize the crucial roles of habitat heterogeneity and fluvial dynamics owing to a lack of fundamental knowledge of the structural and functional features of morphologically intact river corridors. Until quite recently, most concepts in river ecology were based on the implicit assumption that rivers are stable, single-thread channels isolated from adjacent floodplains. Unfortunately, many rivers are in just such a state, but it should be recognized that this is not the natural condition. This incomplete understanding constrains scientific advances in river ecology and renders management and restoration initiatives less effective. Examples are given of the high level of spatio-temporal heterogeneity that may be attained in rivers where natural processes still operate on a large scale. The objective of this paper is to promulgate a broader and more integrative understanding of natural processes in river corridors as a necessary prelude to effective river conservation and management.

A vertical (laterally integrated) two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was expanded to include the capability of simulating river loops as well as tributaries. The model was performed and applied to the Danshuei River estuarine system in northern Taiwan which consists of three major tributaries: the Tahan Stream, Hsintien Stream, Keelung River, and one river loop under the Chung-Hsin Bridge. The expanded model was reverified with observational field data of 2000. The verified model was then used to hindcast the river hydrodynamic conditions with a loop connection between the Danshuci River and Keelung River, which existed prior to 1965. It was found that the configuration of river loop connection has significant impacts on the residual transport along the connecting channel and the salinities in the connected river branches.

22,22,"Becker, JF",Aug 2013 ,Natural channel design impacts on reach-scale transient storage,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Natural channel design stream restoration projects frequently use river steering structures to establish stable planform and meander bend morphology as well as to enhance aquatic ecosystem habitat. This research examined the impact of restoration on aquatic ecosystem function by quantifying transient storage, an important component of hydrologic retention in biogeochemically active zones, in nine restored reaches and seven non-restored reaches in the Finger Lakes and Catskill Mountain regions of New York State. Slug injections of a conservative tracer (Cl-) were used to obtain breakthrough curves at downstream locations in each reach. Reach-scale transient storage areas, exchange flux, and residence times were estimated by simulating the observed tracer breakthrough curves with the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) model. Velocity transects delineated larger normalized surface storage areas in the restored reaches than in non-restored reaches due to large slow moving eddies below river steering structures. The median of OTIS estimated normalized storage area was 33% larger in restored reaches than in non-restored reaches. Median exchange flux was 105% larger while median residence time was 15% smaller in restored reaches than in non-restored reaches. These results suggest restored reaches are dominated by relatively fast surface transient storage exchange while non-restored reaches have less surface transient storage exchange and may be dominated by shallow hyporheic exchange along the bed.

The course of the Dorea Baltea follows the valley, which between the altitudes of 500 and 600 m is dominated by summits reaching more than 3000 m. The lacustrine- and fluviatile-type sedimentary deposits are accompanied by several alluvial cones that, due to their varying nature, confer very diverse hydrodynamic characteristics to the land. In this particular context, the source and drainage of the Dorea control the hydrodynamics of the aquifers and influence the spatial dispersion of the physicochemical properties of the groundwater. The model also led to quantify and determine the zones and types of exchanges with the river. Simulation of lowering the water table in the river showed the variable sensitivity of the water table piezometry with various spatial impacts. Finally, the stream-aquifer impact is highlighted by the spatial evolution of the sulphate contents coming from deep lateral sources. Taking into account the stream-aquifer exchanges in an underground-flow mathematical model gives a better understanding of the workings of the valley aquifers and thus their management, especially for the development of watercourses in mountainous regions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000183872100007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAquifer-river%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Ban%2Balpine%2Bvalley%253A%2BQuantification%2Band%2Bmodelling%2B%2528Valee%2BD%2527Aoste%252C%2BItaly%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DTriganon%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252Fe03-017%26rft.epage%3D786%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0008-4077%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D775-786%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D775%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DTriganon%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DDzikowski%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DParriaux%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1139/e03-017,,WESTERN ALPS,,"Univ Savoie, Lab Geol & Hydrogeol Aquiferes Montagne, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France"
24,24,"Yin, XA",Oct 2018 ,A New Method of Assessing Environmental Flows in Channelized Urban Rivers,ENGINEERING,"Assessing environmental flows (e-flows) for urban rivers is important for water resources planning and river protection. Many e-flow assessment methods have been established based on species' habitat provision requirements and pollutant dilution requirements. To avoid flood risk, however, many urban rivers have been transformed into straight, trapezoidal-profiled concrete channels, leading to the disappearance of valuable species. With the construction of water pollution-control projects, pollutant inputs into rivers have been effectively controlled in some urban rivers. For these rivers, the e-flows determined by traditional methods will be very small, and will consequently lead to a low priority being given to river protection in future water resources allocation and management. To more effectively assess the e-flows of channelized urban rivers, we propose three e-flow degrees, according to longitudinal hydrological connectivity (high, medium, and low), in addition to the pollutant dilution water requirement determined by the mass-balance equation. In the high connectivity scenario, the intent is for the e-flows to maintain flow velocity, which can ensure the self-purification of rivers and reduce algal blooms; in the medium connectivity scenario, the intent is for the e-flows to permanently maintain the longitudinal hydrological connectivity of rivers that are isolated into several ponds by means of weirs, in order to ensure the exchange of material, energy, and information in rivers; and in the low connectivity scenario, the intent is for the e-flows to intermittently connect isolated ponds every few days (which is designed to further reduce e-flows). The proposed methods have been used in Shiwuli River, China, to demonstrate their effectiveness. The new methods can offer more precise and realistic e-flow results and can effectively direct the construction and management of e-flow supply projects. (C) 2018 THE AUTHORS.

This watershed is located in the Kanto Plain in Japan and includes the hillside of Mt. Tsukuba. Therefore, this watershed includes both steep mountainous areas and rice paddy-dominated flat land. Thus, water management of rice paddies is important and was calculated separately using a paddy model. The use of groundwater for rice paddy irrigation was considered as well as a water supply from outside of the watershed (Kasumigaura Lake). The model parameters were calibrated and validated with reference to the predictability of river water flow and the groundwater level. Using the calibrated model, three-dimensional streamlines, water travel time distributions, and water balance in some grids were clarified.

Daunting environmental pressures at multiple scales makes this necessity more pronounced owing to the special role of stream ecosystems in providing regional services. Understanding how coupled effect of natural and anthropogenic factors controls stream water quality parameters and how the relationships change over space and time will help policy makers and resource managers to target appropriate scales at watershed level for the quality management of stream waters. This paper sums up the information on various natural and anthropocentric factors as major determinants responsible for conditioning and shaping stream water quality parameters and their simultaneous influence on biota and its use.Show less,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000516767800003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B24%26rft.atitle%3DLocal%2Bdeterminants%2Binfluencing%2Bstream%2Bwater%2Bquality%26rft.aufirst%3DAadil%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DHamid%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs13201-019-1043-4%26rft.eissn%3D2190-5495%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2190-5487%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BWATER%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DHamid%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBhat%252C%2BSU%26rft.au%3DJehangir%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+WATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s13201-019-1043-4,"Stream,Natural,Anthropogenic,Factors,Nitrate,Phosphorus","WESTERN SIERRA-NEVADA,LAND-USE,AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS,TEMPERATURE RESPONSE,LANDSCAPE INFLUENCES,ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE,RIPARIAN VEGETATION,FORESTED WATERSHEDS,SEASONAL-VARIATIONS,TEMPORAL VARIATION",,"Univ Kashmir, Dept Environm Sci, Aquat Ecol Lab, Srinagar 190006, India"
28,28,"Wollheim, WM",Aug 2014 ,Nitrate uptake dynamics of surface transient storage in stream channels and fluvial wetlands,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"River systems are important regulators of anthropogenic nitrogen flux between land and ocean. Nitrogen dynamics in small headwater streams have been extensively measured, whereas less is known about contributions of other components of stream networks to nitrogen removal, including larger streams or fluvial wetlands. Here, we quantified nitrate reaction rates in higher-order stream channels and in surface transient storage (STS) zones (sub-systems with greater water residence time than the main channel) of the Ipswich River watershed, a temperate basin characterized by suburban development. We characterized uptake in STS both within higher-order stream channels and in fluvial wetlands that remain connected to advective fluxes but not constrained within channels. We compare reaction rates in these systems to those previously measured in headwater streams in the same basin. We found that (1) nitrate reaction rates (as uptake velocity, upsilon(f)) in higher-order streams (n = 2) differed from each other but were consistent with previous estimates from headwater streams, (2) nitrate reaction rates in STS zones within higher-order stream channels (n = 2) were higher than rates estimated at the whole-stream scale, (3) ambient nitrate reaction rates in fluvial wetland STS (n = 7) were high but comparable to headwater streams with low nitrate concentration, (4) nitrate reaction rates were higher in fluvial wetland STS compared to headwater stream channels at elevated nitrate concentration, and (5) efficiency loss (EL) similar to that found in headwater streams was also apparent in fluvial wetlands. These results indicate that STS are potential hotspots of biogeochemical activity and should be explicitly integrated into network scale biogeochemical models. Further, experimental evidence of EL in fluvial wetlands suggests that the effectiveness of STS to retain N may decline if N loading increases.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000339871700015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNitrate%2Buptake%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2Bsurface%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bchannels%2Band%2Bfluvial%2Bwetlands%26rft.aufirst%3DW.%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DWM%26rft.aulast%3DWollheim%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-014-9993-y%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D257%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D1-3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D239-257%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D239%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D120%26rft.au%3DWollheim%252C%2BWM%26rft.au%3DHarms%252C%2BTK%26rft.au%3DBriggs%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10533-014-9993-y,"Transient storage zones,Nitrogen cycling,Denitrification,River network,Fluvial wetlands,Efficiency loss","IPSWICH RIVER-BASIN,ADDITION EXPERIMENTS,PANTANAL WETLAND,N-RETENTION,DENITRIFICATION,REMOVAL,SATURATION,MASSACHUSETTS,METABOLISM,TRANSPORT",,"Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA"
29,29,"Yang, R",Apr 2020 ,"Temporal variations in riverine hydrochemistry and estimation of the carbon sink produced by coupled carbonate weathering with aquatic photosynthesis on land: an example from the Xijiang River, a large subtropical karst-dominated river in China",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"The coupled carbonate weathering represents a significant carbon sink and can be controlled by the riverine hydrochemical variations. However, magnitudes, variations, and mechanisms responsible for the carbon sink produced by coupled carbonate weathering are unclear. In view of this, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, electrical conductivity, and discharge of the Xijiang River at Wuzhou Hydrologic Gauging Station was recorded during October 2013 to September 2015 to elucidate the temporal variations in riverine hydrochemistry and their controlling mechanisms. To obtain the complete carbon sink flux (CSF) produced by coupled carbonate weathering with terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis in the river basin, the fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), autochthonous organic carbon (AOC, sourced from the transformation of DIC via aquatic photosynthesis), and sedimentary AOC were all considered. The results show that seasonal hydrochemical variations in the Xijiang River were related not only to dilution effects but also aquatic primary production. These results demonstrate that the variations in discharge caused by rainfall played a dominant role in controlling the variations in the CSF due to the chemostatic behavior of DIC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The CSF of the Xijiang River produced by coupled carbonate weathering was calculated as 11.06 t C km(-2) a(-1), including DIC carbon sink flux of 6.56 t C km(-2) a(-1), AOC flux (F-AOC) of 2.25 t C km(-2) a(-1), and sedimentary AOC flux (F-SAOC) of 2.25 t C km(-2) a(-1). The F-AOC and F-SAOC together accounted for approximately 69% of DIC carbon sink flux, or approximately 41% of the CSF, indicating that the riverine AOC flux may be high and must be considered in the estimation of rock weathering-related carbon sinks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000515861200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTemporal%2Bvariations%2Bin%2Briverine%2Bhydrochemistry%2Band%2Bestimation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bcarbon%2Bsink%2Bproduced%2Bby%2Bcoupled%2Bcarbonate%2Bweathering%2Bwith%2Baquatic%2Bphotosynthesis%2Bon%2Bland%253A%2Ban%2Bexample%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BXijiang%2BRiver%252C%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bsubtropical%2Bkarst-dominated%2Briver%2Bin%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DRui%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DYang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-020-07872-8%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D13154%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D13142-13154%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D13142%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DSun%252C%2BHL%26rft.au%3DLin%252C%2BDH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11356-020-07872-8,"Hydrochemical variations,Coupled carbonate weathering-related carbon sink flux,Dilution effect,Aquatic photosynthesis,Chemostatic behavior,Xijiang River","DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON,CO2 CONSUMPTION,SOIL CO2,INSIGHTS,FLUXES,CYCLE,SEQUESTRATION,DELTA-C-13(DIC),BASIN,PONDS",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Guiyang 550081, Peoples R China"

Restoration projects to reduce sediment loading are being implemented in large rivers of the midwestern United States to curb backwater habitat loss and restore backwater-to-river connectivity. During 2004 and 2005, drift nets were set bidirectionally (with and against the flow) within a constructed channel between the Illinois River and an adjacent, 1,100-ha restored backwater, Swan Lake, to investigate the interplay between life history strategies and lateral drift on a diet and seasonal basis. Ambient larval density and species composition within the river and backwater also were quantified. Drift was positively correlated with water velocity in the main stem during 2004, and an estimated 32.3 x 10(6) larvae drifted at the surface of the channel into Swan Lake. In the absence of a flood in 2005, the density and composition of the larval fish assemblage in Swan Lake and the Illinois River appeared to drive larval drift timing, magnitude, and composition. Swan Lake's restoration has maintained some river connectivity and lateral drift functionality for resident fish, but its functionality compared with natural, connected river-backwater systems remains unknown.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000254039600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLateral%2Bexchange%2Bof%2Blarval%2Bfish%2Bbetween%2Ba%2Brestored%2Bbackwater%2Band%2Ba%2Blarge%2Briver%2Bin%2Bthe%2Beast-central%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DLaura%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DLA%26rft.aulast%3DCsoboth%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1577%252FT06-188.1%26rft.epage%3D44%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0002-8487%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DTRANSACTIONS%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BFISHERIES%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D33-44%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D33%26rft.stitle%3DT%2BAM%2BFISH%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D137%26rft.au%3DCsoboth%252C%2BLA%26rft.au%3DGarvey%252C%2BJE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=TRANSACTIONS+OF+THE+AMERICAN+FISHERIES+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1577/T06-188.1,,"UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER,MAIN CHANNEL,FLOODPLAIN RIVER,HABITAT USE,DRIFT,ABUNDANCE,DOWNSTREAM,PATTERNS,LIFE",,"So Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, Dept Zool, Fisheries & Illionis Aquaculture Ctr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA"
31,31,"Small, MJ",Aug 2008 ,Hydrologic versus geomorphic limitation on CPOM storage in stream ecosystems,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Stream ecosystems are the products of interactions between hydrology, geomorphology and ecology, but examining all three components simultaneously is difficult and rarely attempted. Frequently, either geomorphology or hydrology is treated as invariable or static.2. To examine the validity of treating either hydrology or geomorphology as static, we studied the individual and combined effects of hydrology and channel geomorphology on coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) storage. Using data from an experimental leaf release in a hydrologically regulated stream we created a simple numerical model. This allowed us to quantify the relative influence of CPOM trapping and CPOM retention on total long-term CPOM storage under variable regimes of flood frequency and geomorphic structure.3. CPOM storage is a function of supply, flood frequency and the type and frequency of in-stream structures. In-stream structures perform two distinct functions, trapping and retention, whose relative importance in leaf storage changes with stream hydrology. Trapping is more important for CPOM storage in streams with few floods, while retention is more important in streams with frequent floods. Different structures (e.g. boulders, large wood, small wood) perform these functions at different efficiencies. We found that large wood trapped two to three times more leaves than the bank, but that the bank retained leaves two to three times more efficiently.4. A modelled channel with five times the amount of large wood as the study channel (a 'wood restoration') initially stored 14% more leaves than the modelled 'natural' channel. After six floods, however, the modelled wood restoration channel stored 50% less CPOM than the natural channel as the large wood had high trapping but poor retention. The modelled natural channel contained structures that could both trap and retain. Thus, as different structures performed different functions, the structural complexity buffered the stream allochthonous energy base against changes in hydrology through its balance of trapping and retention.5. As the frequency of floods increased, the spatial distribution of CPOM became increasingly patchy as storage was driven entirely by structures with high retention. Thus, the coupling of flood frequency and geomorphic structure influenced CPOM availability, which in turn has ramifications for the entire stream food web.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000257712600012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bversus%2Bgeomorphic%2Blimitation%2Bon%2BCPOM%2Bstorage%2Bin%2Bstream%2Becosystems%26rft.aufirst%3DMelanie%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DSmall%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2008.01999.x%26rft.epage%3D1631%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1618-1631%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1618%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DSmall%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DDoyle%252C%2BMW%26rft.au%3DManners%252C%2BRB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01999.x,"channel structure,coarse particulate organic matter,ecology,hydrology,stream geomorphology","ORGANIC DEBRIS DAMS,2 HEADWATER STREAMS,SEDIMENT TRANSPORT,LEAF-LITTER,PARTICULATE MATTER,WOODLAND STREAM,FLOW,RETENTION,RIVER,RESTORATION",,"Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog, CB 3220, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA"

The flume represented half the width of a schematized river reach with a series of groynes. The experiment was designed to represent typical dimensions of the Dutch River Waal at a geometrical scale of 1:100. The conditions were set to guarantee bed load as well as suspended load sediment transport. Conditions with submerged and emerged groynes were investigated. In addition to traditional measurements, viz., bed-level changes, suspended sediment concentrations, and flow velocities, bed-form propagation was measured in two dimensions using a the particle image velocimetry technique. The results were analyzed with focus on sediment exchange mechanisms and sediment transport patterns. The results demonstrate that under all flow conditions there is a net import of sediment into the groyne fields. The prevailing transport mechanisms vary with the flow stage: if the groynes are emerged it is mainly advection by the primary circulation cell, whereas if the groynes are submerged it is rather residual advection by large-scale coherent flow structures (in a straight reach). Additional entrainment of sediment by enhanced turbulence complicates the erosion/deposition patterns.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000280951000005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSediment%2BExchange%2Bbetween%2Ba%2BRiver%2Band%2BIts%2BGroyne%2BFields%253A%2BMobile-Bed%2BExperiment%26rft.aufirst%3DMohamed%2BF.%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DMFM%26rft.aulast%3DYossef%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HY.1943-7900.0000226%26rft.epage%3D625%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9429%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BENGINEERING-ASCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D610-625%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D610%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BENG-ASCE%26rft.volume%3D136%26rft.au%3DYossef%252C%2BMFM%26rft.au%3Dde%2BVriend%252C%2BHJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+ENGINEERING-ASCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000226,"Groin,Groyne,Mobile bed,Flume experiment,Laboratory experiment,Scour,Sediment,Sediment transport,River,Morphology,Measurements,PIV","SUSPENDED-LOAD TRANSPORT,FLOW,CHANNEL,SCOUR",,"Deltares Delft Hydraul, Delft, Netherlands"

Limited home broadband and mobile phone 3G bandwidths mean many users stream videos at compromised quality. To provide additional bandwidth for streaming, we propose CStream, a system that aggregates bandwidth from multiple cooperating users in a neighborhood environment for better video streaming. CStream exploits the fact that wireless devices have multiple network interfaces and connects cooperating users with a wireless ad-hoc network to aggregate their unused downlink Internet bandwidth. CStream dynamically generates a streaming plan to stream a single video using multiple connections, continuously adapting to changes in the neighborhood and variations in the available bandwidth. CStream is developed and evaluated on a test bed of computers, allowing for a detailed, controlled evaluation of performance. Analysis of the results shows a linear increase in throughput over single-connection streaming and improved video quality as the number of cooperating users in a neighborhood increase.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000336807300017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCStream%253A%2Bneighborhood%2Bbandwidth%2Baggregation%2Bfor%2Bbetter%2Bvideo%2Bstreaming%26rft.aufirst%3DThangam%2BVedagiri%26rft.auinit%3DTV%26rft.aulast%3DSeenivasan%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11042-011-0812-3%26rft.eissn%3D1573-7721%26rft.epage%3D408%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1380-7501%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DMULTIMEDIA%2BTOOLS%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D379-408%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D379%26rft.stitle%3DMULTIMED%2BTOOLS%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D70%26rft.au%3DSeenivasan%252C%2BTV%26rft.au%3DClaypool%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=MULTIMEDIA+TOOLS+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11042-011-0812-3,"Video streaming,Wireless,Bandwidth aggregation",PEER-TO-PEER,,"Worcester Polytech Inst, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USA"

35,35,"Zhang, WG",Feb 15 2022 ,Comparing the Yangtze and Mississippi River Deltas in the light of coupled natural-human dynamics: Lessons learned and implications for management,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Mississippi River Delta (MRD) are two of the largest deltas in the world. De-spite similar forcing conditions of fluvial sediment reduction and relative sea-level rise, there are significant dif-ferences in deltaic change caused by hydrodynamics and human activities. In this review, we compare the morphological changes of the two deltas at multiple spatial and temporal scales and identify the lessons learned from past engineering and management strategies. While the YRD has seen an increase of subaerial land of ~1500 km(2) since 1950, the MRD has lost approximately 5000 km(2) of land since the early 1930s. Extensive land reclamation and coastal shoreline embankment in the YRD have led to land gain at the expense of tidal wetland shrinkage. In contrast, flood control, waterway transportation, and petroleum industry in the MRD have resulted in levee construction and canal building, which together with subsidence and sea-level rise, have led to signifi-cant wetland loss in the MRD. The tidal forcing in the YRD is much stronger than that in the MRD, which has played a role in redistributing subaqueous sediment back into the delta plain, offsetting the negative effect of flu-vial sediment reduction. In contrast with continuous population increase on the YRD, wetland loss and exposure to flooding hazards have resulted in population loss on the MRD. These comparative analyses reveal that nature and human interventions have acted together in shaping the modern deltaic morphology. Using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) analysis framework, we propose a conceptual model to provide holistic understanding of the natural-human coupled delta system and management strategies, which could yield broad implications for coping with the future challenges in global deltas.

However, few studies have attempted to identify physical controls on particle transport. One reason has been the lack of relatively simple, inexpensive methods. We describe a new technique for measuring fine particle transport in streams using fluoresently labeled yeast as FPOM analogs. We used steady state injections of yeast and a conservative tracer (Cl) in 6 reaches along a stream continuum at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest to explore the relationship between hydrologic properties of stream readies and particle transport. The yeast technique is relatively easy and inexpensive, and measures of fine particle transport derived from this approach were comparable to those obtained for natural seston and other seston analogs in similarly sized streams. The transport distance of yeast particles (S-p) increased along the stream continuum. S-p was negatively correlated with relative transient storage (k(1)/k(2)) and positively correlated with hydrologic exchange rates of the main channel (k(1)) and transient storage (k(2)). The depositional velocity of yeast (v(dep)), which normalizes average transport distances for stream velocity and depth, showed no trend along the continuum and was not related to k(1), k(2), or k(1)/k(2). Together, these results suggest that velocity and depth were the most important factors in determining differences in particle transport along the continuum.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000176159000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DParticle%2Btransport%2Band%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Balong%2Ba%2Bstream-size%2Bgradient%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHubbard%2BBrook%2BExperimental%2BForest%26rft.aufirst%3DMJ%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DPaul%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468409%26rft.epage%3D205%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D195-205%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D195%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DPaul%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1468409,"fine particulate organic matter (FPOM),fine particle transport,fluorescently labeled yeast,hydrologic exchange,depositional velocity,streams","PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER,HEADWATER STREAMS,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,SESTON TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,LAKE-OUTLET,RETENTION,PHOSPHORUS,EXCHANGE,EXPORT",,"Tetra Tech Inc, Suite 110,10045 Rd Run Blvd, Owings Mills, MD 21117 USA"

Results obtained with the transient storage model indicate that storage zones make up a significant proportion of the total stream cross section. This result is consistent with the fact that the river is lined with profuse marginal vegetation. However, because of their high density, exchange between these areas and the main channel is minimal. Hence, their net impact is to increase velocity and depth, rather than to trap pollutants. Measurement of gas exchange indicates that, although storage zone models fit tracer profiles better, the effect of transient storage on the estimation of gas transfer rates is negligible for systems like the Piako.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000088391100004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTransient%2Bstorage%2Band%2Bgas%2Btransfer%2Bin%2Blowland%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DSC%26rft.auinit%3DSC%26rft.aulast%3DChapra%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9372%25282000%2529126%253A8%2528708%2529%26rft.epage%3D712%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9372%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BENGINEERING-ASCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D708-712%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D708%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BENG-ASCE%26rft.volume%3D126%26rft.au%3DChapra%252C%2BSC%26rft.au%3DWilcock%252C%2BRJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+ENGINEERING-ASCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2000)126:8(708),,"SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,REACTIVE SOLUTE TRANSPORT,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,RIFFLE STREAM,MODEL,SIMULATION,ZONES,FLOW",,"Tufts Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Medford, MA 02155 USA"

A set of 271 stream sediment samples was used for spatial modelling and further definition of rings of enrichment-high and low rings. A three-step multivariate statistical and geostatistical approach was used: (1) principal components analysis for PTE's association evaluation and dimensionality reduction; (2) ordinary kriging as an unbiased interpolator for content inference and construction of a continuous representation of the considered attributes, at any arbitrary spatial location; (3) G clustering algorithm for the definition of high and low significance clusters. A moderate contamination in stream sediments is observed for almost all the considered PTE and a very high contamination for Ba, Cr and B. High contamination clusters are observed for Fe, Ni, Ba, Cu, B, Zn, Vnorthwest and southeast clusters- and for Cr-north and southwest clusters. The contamination degree index varies from moderate to high, which is mainly associated with the old mineralizations. The high computed rings often overlap the areas of abandoned Ba-Zn mineralization, as well as the sedimentary gold concentrations, along the Erges River banks. Tin and Cd spatial distribution may be related to former cassiterite exploitations in the survey area. Chromium is possibly connected with the schists. The definition of clusters with a PTE spatial enrichment will allow for the identification of contamination activities and therefore, the definition of adequate monitoring and mitigation actions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000452307100020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Benvironmental%2Brisk%2Bevaluation%2Bof%2Bpotential%2Btoxic%2Belements%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bsediments%26rft.aufirst%3DI.%2BM.%2BH.%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DIMHR%26rft.aulast%3DAntunes%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10653-018-0124-x%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2983%26rft.epage%3D2585%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0269-4042%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BGEOCHEMISTRY%2BAND%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2573-2585%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2573%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BGEOCHEM%2BHLTH%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DAntunes%252C%2BIMHR%26rft.au%3DAlbuquerque%252C%2BMTD%26rft.au%3DRoque%252C%2BN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+GEOCHEMISTRY+AND+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10653-018-0124-x,"Stream sediments,Contamination factor,Contamination degree,Principal components analysis,Ordinary kriging,G clustering","HEAVY-METAL POLLUTION,TRACE-METALS,ECOLOGICAL RISK,URANIUM-MINE,RIVER,GOLD,WATER,EXPLORATION,CONTAMINATION,INDEX",,"Univ Lisbon, CERENA, Univ Minho, ICT, Campus Gualtar, Braga, Portugal"
39,39,"Reijo, CJ",Jun 2018 ,"Isolating stream metabolism and nitrate processing at point-scales, and controls on heterogeneity",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Stream solute signals arise from the convolution of catchment delivery, hydraulic transport, and biogeochemical processing. Drawing inference from such signals requires analytical or experimental tools to isolate the signal attributable to stream processing. We used Lexan (R) chambers open to the air and inserted into the sediment (benthic chambers) and high-frequency in situ sensors to measure metabolism and nutrient processing rates for a small (0.36 m(2)) footprint across a variety of benthic cover types. We estimated gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) based on high-resolution dissolved 0 2 measurements, and we estimated N retention via both autotrophic assimilation (U-A) and dissimilatory removal (U-D) from high-resolution NO3- measurements. We observed marked spatial variation in metabolism and nutrient retention, principally in response to autotroph cover and light during thirty-three 1-wk deployments in Gum Slough, a spring-fed river (discharge approximate to 1.5 m(3)/s) in northern Florida. Spatially weighted mean chamber rates were commensurate with, but slightly underpredicted, open-channel measurements. Moreover, the stoichiometry (i.e., molar C : N from GPP and U-A) matched expectations based on tissue stoichiometry and autotroph composition. Our approach enabled disaggregated measurements of metabolic processing across heterogeneous riverine settings, albeit principally where sediments were sufficiently fine-grained to limit hydraulic exchange (assessed here with a Cl- tracer). In addition, the small chamber volume allowed manipulation of myriad environmental factors, including solute concentrations via both active enrichment, or, in our case, passive depletion. We observed negligible GPP and minimal U-A responses to NO3- depletion, in contrast to strong U-D responses.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000432253900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIsolating%2Bstream%2Bmetabolism%2Band%2Bnitrate%2Bprocessing%2Bat%2Bpoint-scales%252C%2Band%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bheterogeneity%26rft.aufirst%3DCourtney%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DCJ%26rft.aulast%3DReijo%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F697319%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D250%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D238-250%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D238%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D37%26rft.au%3DReijo%252C%2BCJ%26rft.au%3DHensley%252C%2BRT%26rft.au%3DCohen%252C%2BMJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/697319,"stream,metabolism,nitrate,heterogeneity,chambers","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,BENTHIC COMMUNITY METABOLISM,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,PATCH DYNAMICS,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,NUTRIENT LIMITATION,HYPORHEIC ZONE,UPTAKE LENGTH,PHOSPHORUS,NITROGEN",,"Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32641 USA"
40,40,"Vautier, C",Aug 2020 ,A new method to quantify air-water gas exchanges in streams based on slug injection and semicontinuous measurement,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS,"Gas exchanges between streams and atmosphere strongly impact biogeochemical cycles, yet their quantification in space and time remains challenging. We propose a new method to measure gas exchange rate coefficients in headwater streams. The method is based on simultaneous slug injections of a conservative tracer and a volatile tracer, coupled to in situ semicontinuous measurements. Its originality lies in the mathematical exploitation of the tracers' breakthrough curves. Taking advantage of the entire breakthrough curves, we infer the gas exchange rate coefficient from a comparative analysis of the shape of the volatile and the conservative breakthrough curves. Tests on synthetic datasets confirmed the validity of the mathematical framework for the whole range of gas exchange rate coefficients found in headwater streams. Field experiments further attested to the real-world applicability of the method. Salt and helium injections were performed in a first-order stream and the helium breakthrough curves were obtained using in situ membrane inlet mass spectrometry. This new method allows to determine the gas exchange rates directly in the field, without any external calibration of the data. Its fast implementation enables a wider spatial coverage of the measurements of gas exchange rates, and thus offers an opportunity to improve the large-scale estimates of CO(2)emissions from headwater streams. More generally, our study highlights the informative potential of semicontinuous datasets and encourages further investigation of possible use of temporal signals.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000550966000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bnew%2Bmethod%2Bto%2Bquantify%2Bair-water%2Bgas%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bslug%2Binjection%2Band%2Bsemicontinuous%2Bmeasurement%26rft.aufirst%3DCamille%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DVautier%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Flom3.10376%26rft.epage%3D465%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1541-5856%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D453-465%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D453%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR-METH%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DVautier%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DAbherve%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3Dde%2BDreuzy%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/lom3.10376,,"INLET MASS-SPECTROMETRY,DISSOLVED-GASES,REAERATION,TRACER,METABOLISM,RATES,CO2,TERRESTRIAL,DELIBERATE,SYSTEM",,"Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes, Rennes, France"

The purpose of the experiments was to measure, for the first time, the real and imaginary portion of streaming potentials. In addition, the measured frequency range was extended beyond any previous measurements, Frequency-dependent streaming potential experiments were conducted on one glass capillary and two porous glass filters. The sample pore diameters ranged from 1 mm to 34 mum, Two frequency-dependent models (Packard and Pride) were compared to the data. Both Pride's and Packard's models have a good fit to the experimental data in the low- and intermediate-frequency regime. In the high-frequency regime, the data fit the theory after being corrected for capacitance effects of the experimental setup. Pride's generalized model appears to have the ability to more accurately estimate pore sizes in the porous medium samples, Packard's model has one unknown model parameter while Pride's model has four unknown model parameters, two of which can be independently determined experimentally. Pride's additional parameters may allow for a determination of permeability.

In short-term models, it is of particular importance to consider maximum/minimum values and ramp limits for the stream level of a river. However, in order to properly represent such constraints, it is also necessary to model in detail the river routing, i.e., the water wave propagation along the channels that connect reservoirs in cascade. This paper proposes a linear programming model to represent river stream-level constraints and river-routing effects in the short-term hydrothermal dispatch problem. Results show the high accuracy of the proposed approach to represent maximum hourly and daily river-level variations as well as the impacts of taking into account a detailed representation of river routing in the operation of hydrothermal systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000341190700044,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DShort-Term%2BHydrothermal%2BDispatch%2BWith%2BRiver-Level%2Band%2BRouting%2BConstraints%26rft.aufirst%3DAndre%2BLuiz%26rft.auinit%3DAL%26rft.aulast%3DDiniz%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTPWRS.2014.2300755%26rft.eissn%3D1558-0679%26rft.epage%3D2435%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-8950%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BPOWER%2BSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2427-2435%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2427%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BPOWER%2BSYST%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DDiniz%252C%2BAL%26rft.au%3DSouza%252C%2BTM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+POWER+SYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2300755,"Hydrothermal dispatch,linear programming,multiple uses of water,river routing","HYDRO UNIT COMMITMENT,NETWORK FLOW,GENERATION,MODEL,DECOMPOSITION,POWER,HEAD",,"Brazilian Elect Energy Res Ctr, CEPEL, BR-21941911 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil"
44,44,"Quintas-Soriano, C",Jan 2022 ,A framework for assessing coupling and de-coupling trajectories in river social-ecological systems,SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE,"The degree of coupling between the social and ecological components of social-ecological systems is seen as fundamental to understanding their functioning, interactions and trajectories. Yet, there is limited work about how to empirically understand the degree of coupling between social and ecological systems, nor the processes by which the degree of coupling could change over time. Here, we introduce a conceptual framework for characterizing trajectories over time of coupling and de-coupling in social-ecological river systems. We analyze two conceptual scenarios describing coupling and de-coupling trajectories in a social-ecological system and define a series of key concepts for understanding social-ecological system trajectories. We tested these coupling and de-coupling trajectories theory by linking these concepts to empirical case examples of two river social-ecological systems in the western United States. Finally, we propose a quantitative approach with the potential for evaluating the level of social-ecological coupling and de-coupling trajectories in other SES contexts. This paper represents an advancing on the identification of specific actions that explain current SES trajectories and immediate actions to reinforce or shift the trajectory.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000706070800008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bframework%2Bfor%2Bassessing%2Bcoupling%2Band%2Bde-coupling%2Btrajectories%2Bin%2Briver%2Bsocial-ecological%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DCristina%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DQuintas-Soriano%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11625-021-01048-0%26rft.eissn%3D1862-4057%26rft.epage%3D134%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1862-4065%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D121-134%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D121%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAIN%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DQuintas-Soriano%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DBrandt%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DCastro%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11625-021-01048-0,"Complex adaptive systems,Feedback,Governance,Idaho,Land use trajectory,Social-ecological resilience,Vulnerability","PERSPECTIVE,RESILIENCE,CARBON",,"Univ Almeria, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Ctr Andaluz Evaluac & Seguimiento Cambio Global C, Almeria 04120, Spain"
45,45,"Intaraprasong, T",Jun 30 2009 ,A general framework of stream-aquifer interaction caused by variable stream stages,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Stream-aquifer interface is a critical zone where surface water and groundwater exchange mass, energy, and chemicals. Previous analytical studies of stream-aquifer interaction consider stream stage fluctuations that are only functions of time. This study improves those solutions by simultaneously considering temporally and spatially variable stream stages, low-permeability streambeds, and pumping wells nearby the streams. Semi-analytical solutions of drawdown and stream-aquifer flow rate in the Laplace-Fourier domain are provided and used to obtain solutions in the real time-space domain after the inverse Laplace-Fourier transform, where the stream-aquifer flow rate refers to the rate of discharge between a stream and an adjacent aquifer. The stream-aquifer flow rate caused by the temporally variable stream stage is found to decline with time and becomes negligible when time is sufficiently long. A closed-form analytical solution for the stream-aquifer flow rate caused by a diffusive-type flood wave is obtained, and it can be used to predict the response of an aquifer upon a passing flood wave. For a diffusive-type flood wave that dies out in about 24 h, we find that the stream-aquifer flow rate drops nearly exponentially with time and dies out at about 13.4 h for a sandy aquifer and an alluvial streambed. Sensitivity analysis shows that the stream-aquifer flow rate increases with the diffusion coefficient of the flood wave (D) which controls the width and amplitude of the wave, and decreases with the average flood wave velocity (v). Low-permeability streambeds reduce stream-aquifer flow rate and also delay the response to the stream stage fluctuations. For a time-dependent cosine stream stage function with a period of 30 days, the maximal stream-aquifer flow rate with a 0.5 m thick low-permeability streambed is 24% less than that obtained without the streambed.

46,46,"Shen, YX",Sep 20 2022 ,E-DBCM: A dynamically coupled upland and in-stream water quality model for watershed water quality simulation,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"A dynamic bidirectional coupled modeling framework for water environment simulation (E-DBCM), including an upland watershed model (UWSM) and a two-dimensional (2D) downstream waterbody model (DWBM), is proposed. The UWSM is implemented to describe the rainfall-runoff and determine the pollutant load to downstream waterbodies, whereas the DWBM is used to simulate the pollutant transport and flood processes on downstream waterbodies. The UWSM and DWBM are spatially connected through a moving boundary, which can ensure the mass and momentum conservation. The proposed E-DBCM is verified using three case studies and the results indicate that the E-DBCM has satisfactory numerical accuracy, which can effectively reproduce the pollutant transport process and achieve satisfactory results. The water environment in Yanqi River Basin is assessed based on the proposed model. The simulated results are consistent with the measured data, indicating that the E-DBCM is reliable and the prediction accuracy can meet the requirements of engineering practices. Water is seriously polluted in this watershed, especially during peak tourist season when many pollutants are produced. Various measures should be taken to protect the water environment in this basin.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000891427200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B986528%26rft.atitle%3DE-DBCM%253A%2BA%2Bdynamically%2Bcoupled%2Bupland%2Band%2Bin-stream%2Bwater%2Bquality%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bwatershed%2Bwater%2Bquality%2Bsimulation%26rft.aufirst%3DYanxia%26rft.auinit%3DYX%26rft.aulast%3DShen%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2022.986528%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D4%26rft.au%3DShen%252C%2BYX%26rft.au%3DZhu%252C%2BZD%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BCB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/frwa.2022.986528,"watershed water environment,UWSM,2D DWBM,E-DBCM,dynamic bidirectional coupling model","TRANSPORT,FLOW,POLLUTION,ACCURACY,SEDIMENT,OVERLAND,POINT",,"Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China"
47,47,"Cornwell, JC",Jul 2016 ,Sediment-Water Nitrogen Exchange along the Potomac River Estuarine Salinity Gradient,JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,"Observations of N-2 efflux in estuarine sediments across the salinity gradient of the tidal Potomac River, a eutrophic subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay, were used to evaluate environmental controls of microbial denitrification. Rates of denitrification were measured using N-2:Ar ratios in core incubations and were similar to other nitrogen-enriched estuaries, with summer and spring N-2-N efflux rates averaging 54 +/- 47 and 153 +/- 97 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The paradigm of higher denitrification rates at lower salinities was not supported by observations during summer and spring conditions along this estuarine salinity gradient. Low bottom water oxygen concentrations in the lower, more saline part of the estuary resulted in low rates of coupled nitrification/denitrification. The most favorable region for denitrification in the tidal Potomac River occurred where changes in salinity were most rapid and oxygen concentrations were not depleted, with high rates observed within the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) zone. Overall, the key role of salinity in the tidal Potomac River in controlling denitrification appears to be in the focusing of materials into ETM and providing stratification in the lower estuary that restricts the vertical exchange of oxygen necessary for coupled nitrification/denitrification.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000380832400005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSediment-Water%2BNitrogen%2BExchange%2Balong%2Bthe%2BPotomac%2BRiver%2BEstuarine%2BSalinity%2BGradient%26rft.aufirst%3DJeffrey%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DJC%26rft.aulast%3DCornwell%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2112%252FJCOASTRES-D-15-00159.1%26rft.eissn%3D1551-5036%26rft.epage%3D787%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0749-0208%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BCOASTAL%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D776-787%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D776%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BCOASTAL%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DCornwell%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DOwens%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DHarris%252C%2BLA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+COASTAL+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00159.1,"Denitrification,nitrification,estuarine biogeochemistry,estuarine turbidity maximum zone,Chesapeake Bay","DISSIMILATORY NITRATE REDUCTION,ANAEROBIC AMMONIUM OXIDATION,CHESAPEAKE BAY SEDIMENTS,DENITRIFICATION RATES,COASTAL SEDIMENTS,TURBIDITY MAXIMUM,AQUATIC SEDIMENTS,MARINE-SEDIMENTS,ORGANIC-MATTER,UNITED-KINGDOM",,"Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Horn Point Lab, Cambridge, MD 21613 USA"
48,48,"Yan, W",2021 ,RESEARCH ON THE COUPLING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE AND LOWER REACHES OF THE YELLOW RIVER BASED ON EKC MODEL,FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN,"As the development momentum of the ecological environment construction in China continues to strengthen, the focus of ecological environmental protection and development continues to advance. As one of the important rivers in China, the Yellow River plays an important role in the development of runoff economy. At present, the economic development of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River is simple and lacks effective competitiveness. Through understanding and analyzing the economic development patterns of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the types of industries related to the ecological industries in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, the coupling relationship between the economic development patterns of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the quality of the ecological environment is analyzed. Based on the EKC model, we analyze the current research cases in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and build the EKC function model framework relationship. TK enterprise is used as a case study, which is a typical production enterprise type in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. We construct a functional relationship between the two and build the enterprise economic development index Ce (0-100 interval) and the enterprise as an example. The ecological environment quality index Er value (0-100 interval) is mainly used to study the coupling relationship. The time is 10 years from 2010 to 2020. After the data sample is collected, the MATLAB 21.0b software Surf model is used to verify that the coupling relationship has a significant correlation. Combining the analysis of data recovery samples from 2010 to 2020, constructing the two -factor empirical analysis results under the Surf model, and analyzing the results of the coupling relationship constructed by the function, the EKC model analysis empirical results of TK companies in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River are revealed. In the analysis of the coupling relationship between economic development and ecological environment quality, it is verified that the higher the ecological environment quality index, the faster the TK enterprise's ecological economic development speed, the better the significant normal correlation distribution.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000728493300056,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRESEARCH%2BON%2BTHE%2BCOUPLING%2BRELATIONSHIP%2BBETWEEN%2BECOLOGICAL%2BENVIRONMENT%2BQUALITY%2BAND%2BECONOMIC%2BDEVELOPMENT%2BIN%2BTHE%2BMIDDLE%2BAND%2BLOWER%2BREACHES%2BOF%2BTHE%2BYELLOW%2BRIVER%2BBASED%2BON%2BEKC%2BMODEL%26rft.aufirst%3DWei%26rft.auinit%3DW%26rft.aulast%3DYan%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft.eissn%3D1610-2304%26rft.epage%3D13179%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1018-4619%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESENIUS%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BBULLETIN%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D13173-13179%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D13173%26rft.stitle%3DFRESEN%2BENVIRON%2BBULL%26rft.volume%3D30&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4HG8bnXk2YPMmQ6Sq1IR&SrcJTitle=FRESENIUS+ENVIRONMENTAL+BULLETIN&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"EKC model,the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River,economic development,ecological environment,coupling analysis","KUZNETS CURVE,GROWTH",,"Luoyang Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Luoyang 471023, Henan, Peoples R China"
49,49,"Wu, K",May 1 2022 ,Tunable skyrmion-edge interaction in magnetic multilayers by interlayer exchange coupling,AIP ADVANCES,"Magnetic skyrmions are appealing for applications in emerging topological spintronic devices. However, when magnetic skyrmions in a nanowire are driven by an in-plane current, a transverse Magnus force deflects their trajectories from the current direction, which tends to push the skyrmion toward the edge. If the current density is exceedingly large, the skyrmion will be annihilated around the edge, leading to a greatly reduced propagation distance and a maximum speed of the skyrmion, which is detrimental to skyrmion-based spintronic applications. Here, we prepare a magnetic multilayer Ta/[Pt/Co](3)/Ru/[Co/Pt](3) and tailor the interlayer exchange coupling strength by varying the thickness of the Ru layer. Based on the magneto-optic Kerr effect microscope, we find that the skyrmion-edge interaction is tunable by the interlayer exchange coupling strength, namely, the strength of the repulsive potential from the film edge is tailored by the interlayer exchange coupling strength. Our results unveil the significant role of the interlayer exchange coupling in skyrmion dynamics.
