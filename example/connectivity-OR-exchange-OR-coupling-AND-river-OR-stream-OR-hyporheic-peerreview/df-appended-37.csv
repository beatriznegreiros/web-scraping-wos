0,0,"Tarpanelli, A",Jan 2015 ,Coupling MODIS and Radar Altimetry Data for Discharge Estimation in Poorly Gauged River Basins,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,"The capability of coupling measurements of river velocity derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and water levels derived from ENVISAT Advanced Radar Altimeter (RA-2) for river discharge estimation is thoroughly investigated. The method is applied even considering the possible unavailability of the river cross-section survey by using the entropy theory for reconstructing the bathymetry. The discharge estimation accuracy is validated using in situ measurements along the Po River (Northern Italy) where daily observations are available for the period 2005-2010. The agreement with the observed discharge is fairly satisfactory with coefficient of correlation of 0.91 and relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) of similar to 37 on average. Therefore, the coupling of the two sensors provides, with a good level of accuracy, the hydraulic quantities to use for discharge estimation. These results are particularly significant for the forthcoming European Space Agency Sentinel-3 mission, in which a visible-near infrared multispectral sensor and an altimeter will be onboard the same satellite platform providing significant improvements in terms of vertical accuracy and spatial-temporal resolution.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000349550400014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BMODIS%2Band%2BRadar%2BAltimetry%2BData%2Bfor%2BDischarge%2BEstimation%2Bin%2BPoorly%2BGauged%2BRiver%2BBasins%26rft.aufirst%3DAngelica%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DTarpanelli%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FJSTARS.2014.2320582%26rft.eissn%3D2151-1535%26rft.epage%3D148%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1939-1404%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BSELECTED%2BTOPICS%2BIN%2BAPPLIED%2BEARTH%2BOBSERVATIONS%2BAND%2BREMOTE%2BSENSING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D141-148%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D141%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BJ-STARS%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DTarpanelli%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBrocca%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DMoramarco%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=IEEE+JOURNAL+OF+SELECTED+TOPICS+IN+APPLIED+EARTH+OBSERVATIONS+AND+REMOTE+SENSING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2320582,"Discharge,flow velocity,Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS),Po River,radar altimetry,remote sensing","SATELLITE ALTIMETRY,VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION,NATURAL CHANNELS,SOIL-MOISTURE,WATER LEVELS,DEPTH,FLOOD",,"CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, I-06128 Perugia, Italy"
1,1,"Harte, PT",Mar 2009 ,"Measured river leakages using conventional streamflow techniques: the case of Souhegan River, New Hampshire, USA",HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Multiple streamflow measurements were made at coupled discharge measurement stations to quantify rates of aquifer recharge and discharge on two reaches of the Souhegan River, New Hampshire, USA, flowing within a glacial-drift river-valley aquifer. The reaches included a predominantly losing (aquifer recharge) reach and a variable (aquifer recharge and discharge) reach located downstream of the former reach. River leakage, the differential between coupled upstream and downstream streamflow measurements along a reach, varied by almost 30 cubic feet per second (ft(3)/s) (0.85m(3)/s) along the two reaches. The upper reach averaged 3.94ft(3)/s (0.11m(3)/s) loss whereas the lower reach averaged 4.85ft(3)/s (0.14m(3)/s) gain. At the upper reach, 13 losses were measured out of 19 coupled measurements. At the lower reach, ten out of 13 coupled measurements indicated gains in flow and suggest that this reach is primarily a gaining river reach. An important factor in river leakage appears to be antecedent trends in river stage. At the upper reach, gains were measured only during periods of declining river stage. Conversely, at the lower reach, streamflow loss was measured primarily during periods of rising river stage. Although some tendencies exist, several factors complicate the analysis of river leakage, most notably the inaccuracies in computed stream discharge.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000266008100013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMeasured%2Briver%2Bleakages%2Busing%2Bconventional%2Bstreamflow%2Btechniques%253A%2Bthe%2Bcase%2Bof%2BSouhegan%2BRiver%252C%2BNew%2BHampshire%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DPhilip%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DPT%26rft.aulast%3DHarte%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-008-0359-1%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D424%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D409-424%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D409%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DHarte%252C%2BPT%26rft.au%3DKiah%252C%2BRG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-008-0359-1,"Groundwater/surface-water relations,River leakages,Streamflow,Aquifer recharge,USA,Conceptual models,Rainfall/runoff",,,"US Geol Survey, 361 Commerce Way, Pembroke, NH 03301 USA"

Aquatic birds breed on streams in the area and maybe exposed to excessive amounts of selenium through their diets. In this article, we present the results of a dietary-based assessment of the risk that selenium may pose to two aquatic bird species, the American Dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) and the Harlequin Duck (Histrionicus histrionicus), on one of the coal mine-affected streams, the Gregg River. The study consisted of (1) a literature-based toxicity assessment, (2) simulation of selenium exposure in the diets and eggs of the two species, and (3) a risk assessment that coupled information on toxicity and exposure. Diet and egg selenium concentrations associated with a 20% hatch failure rate were 6.4 and 17 mu g center dot g(-1) dry wt, respectively. Simulated dietary selenium concentrations were about 2.0-2.5 mu g center dot g(-1) higher on the Gregg River than on reference streams for both species. Simulated predicted egg concentrations averaged 2.0 and 1.4 Ag - g-' higher on the Gregg River than on reference streams for American Dippers and Harlequin Ducks, respectively. When simulated dietary concen trations were considered, hatch failure rates on the Gregg River were predicted to average 12% higher in American Dippers and 8% higher in Harlequin Ducks than at reference streams. Corresponding values were only 3% for both species when predicted egg concentrations were used. Elevated levels of selenium in insects in some of the reference streams were unexpected and raised a question as to whether aquatic birds have evolved a higher tolerance level for dietary selenium in these areas.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000248576100007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bdietary%2Bassessment%2Bof%2Bselenium%2Brisk%2Bto%2Baquatic%2Bbirds%2Bon%2Ba%2Bcoal%2Bmine%2Baffected%2Bstream%2Bin%2BAlberta%252C%2BCanada%26rft.aufirst%3DMark%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DWayland%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F10807030701456734%26rft.eissn%3D1549-7860%26rft.epage%3D842%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1080-7039%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DHUMAN%2BAND%2BECOLOGICAL%2BRISK%2BASSESSMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D823-842%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D823%26rft.stitle%3DHUM%2BECOL%2BRISK%2BASSESS%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DWayland%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DCasey%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DWoodsworth%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=HUMAN+AND+ECOLOGICAL+RISK+ASSESSMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/10807030701456734,"selenium,risk assessment,birds,streams,coal mining,Alberta","DIPPERS CINCLUS-MEXICANUS,AMERICAN DIPPERS,MALLARD REPRODUCTION,DUCKLING GROWTH,RIVER WYE,WATER,ACCUMULATION,THRESHOLDS,EXPOSURE,FISH",,"Environm Canada, Prairie & No Wildlife Res Ctr, 115 Perimeter Rd, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X4, Canada"
3,3,"Chiu, JC",May 2013 ,A relation-exchanging buffering mechanism for instruction and data streaming,COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING,"The traditional memory hierarchy design can smooth the data stream and instruction stream. However, the bandwidth of the instruction stream and data stream are still the main challenge for high-performance microprocessor systems. To improve the data and instruction fetchers, the proposed buffering architecture can exploits both the temporal and spatial localities with a relation-exchanging buffering mechanism. On buffers hit, the dynamic sequences of instruction or data can be reused. At the same time, the prefetching mechanism will be enabled to prefetch the instruction/data being used in the near future. According to the simulation results, the proposed buffering mechanism with the depth 3 and 64-byte line size, which only needs extra 4% hardware cost, is a cost-ineffectiveness choice. The hit rate of an ABP buffer can 22% outperforms that of loop buffer architecture to fetch instruction stream and 7% outperform that of FIFO strategy to fetch data stream.

4,4,"Singh, AK",Mar 2002 ,"Aspects of weathering and solute acquisition processes controlling chemistry of sub-Alpine proglacial streams of Garhwal Himalaya, India",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"An analytical study of major cations and anions of the proglacial streams of Garhwal Himalaya has been carried out to assess the weathering and geochemical processes in high altitude river basins. Calcium and magnesium are the major cations, and bicarbonate and sulphate are the most dominant anions in these waters. A high correlation among HCO3, Ca and Mg, a relatively high contribution of (Ca + Mg) to the total cations (TZ(+)) and high (Ca + Mg/Na + K) ratio indicate carbonate weathering could be the primary source of the dissolved ions. Carbonic acid weathering is the major proton-producing reaction in the Alaknanda River, while in the Bhagirathi River it is the coupled reaction which controls the solute acquisition processes. To know the geochemical factors controlling the chemical nature of water, R-mode factor analysis on major ion data from Ganga headwater streams has been performed. Factor 1 in the Alaknanda River is explicitly a bicarbonate factor showing strong loading of EC, Ca, Mg, HCO3 and TDS. In the Bhagirathi River Factor I explains the sulphide dissolution and silicate weathering and Factor 2 explains carbonate weathering. Wide downstream variations are observed in the total dissolved solids (TDS) and total suspended matter (TSM) in the headwater streams of the Ganga. Quartz and feldspar are the common detrital minerals, and kaolinite and illite the common clay minerals in the suspended sediment.

5,5,"ADMIRAAL, W",Aug 13 1993 ,THE RIVERS RHINE AND MEUSE IN THE NETHERLANDS - PRESENT STATE AND SIGNS OF ECOLOGICAL RECOVERY,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The ecosystems of the rivers Rhine and Meuse have suffered drastic environmental changes, for example because of the regulation of the stream bed and the construction of weirs and dams. Furthermore, discharges of industrial and municipal waste water have caused the water quality of these rivers to deteriorate; this problem became acute in the sixties and seventies. Recently some chemical parameters of water quality have improved in the Rhine, and as a consequence some aquatic communities are showing signs of recovery after decades of severe degradation. This paper describes the present state of the aquatic communities in the Dutch part of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, using published observations on plankton, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish. The sparse information on the food chain in these rivers is summarized. The main channels of the Rhine and Meuse are characterized by a dense plankton that develops rapidly in the nutrient-rich river waters. The stream beds, now dominated by wave-exposed sand and gravel, have a sparse fauna and flora. The river banks, mostly consolidated by blocks of stone, offer a substratum for numerous benthic organisms, particularly now that the water quality has improved. The floodplain waters and old river channels harbour a flora and fauna rich in species. The degree of water exchange with the river is crucial for the ecological development of the river and its backwaters. Today the freshwater tidal reaches of the rivers occupy a very restricted area, and only remnants of the previously abundant vegetation of rushes are found.Losses in the numbers of animal and plant species, notably those specific to rivers, are evident, but over the last 15 years several species have returned. Allochthonous species (exotics), including crustaceans and molluscs, have also settled in the Rhine and Meuse. Fish species characteristic of these rivers, such as river lamprey, sea trout, barbel, and flounder, have recently been observed in appreciable numbers.The Rhine Action Programme provides a framework for the large-scale rehabilitation of the Rhine. Experiments on re-stocking the Rhine with Atlantic salmon,and on the ecological rehabilitation of floodplains are being carried out on the assumption that there will be a further reduction of the pollution load. A similar programme is required for the Meuse.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1993LZ11600006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTHE%2BRIVERS%2BRHINE%2BAND%2BMEUSE%2BIN%2BTHE%2BNETHERLANDS%2B-%2BPRESENT%2BSTATE%2BAND%2BSIGNS%2BOF%2BECOLOGICAL%2BRECOVERY%26rft.aufirst%3DW%26rft.auinit%3DW%26rft.aulast%3DADMIRAAL%26rft.date%3D1993%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00007264%26rft.epage%3D128%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1-3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D97-128%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D97%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D265%26rft.au%3DADMIRAAL%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DVANDERVELDE%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DCAZEMIER%252C%2BWG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/BF00007264,"RIVER RHINE,RIVER MEUSE,RIVER ECOSYSTEMS,ECOLOGICAL REHABILITATION,POLLUTION ABATEMENT","MAJOR RIVERS,CRUSTACEA,BRACKISH,DECAPODA,WATER,AREA",,"NATL INST PUBL HLTH & ENVIRONM PROTECT,POB 1,3720 BA BILTHOVEN,NETHERLANDS"
6,6,"Ozzola, R",Jan 2022 ,On the Relation Between Beam Coupling and Feed Coupling in Wideband Antenna Arrays,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION,"We present a study on beam coupling in radiating structures that support multiple simultaneous beams. The formation of multiple beams is relevant in modern wireless communication applications when diverse data streams can be sent from a single transmitter to users located in different directions. General expressions are provided that relate the coupling between radiated beams to the associated current distributions on the radiating aperture. When expanding the currents in terms of basis functions, the beam coupling can be also written in terms of coupling contributions due to each pair of basis functions. The analysis is applied to antenna arrays with different levels of mutual coupling between the array elements. More specifically, arrays of resonant elements, characterized by very low mutual coupling, are compared with arrays of connected elements, which are strongly coupled. We show that, even for a very high level of mutual coupling between individual array elements, it is possible to obtain orthogonal beams if the total current distributions associated with the beams are uncoupled.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000742198500030,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2Bthe%2BRelation%2BBetween%2BBeam%2BCoupling%2Band%2BFeed%2BCoupling%2Bin%2BWideband%2BAntenna%2BArrays%26rft.aufirst%3DRiccardo%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DOzzola%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTAP.2021.3090536%26rft.eissn%3D1558-2221%26rft.epage%3D267%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-926X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BANTENNAS%2BAND%2BPROPAGATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D260-267%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D260%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BANTENN%2BPROPAG%26rft.volume%3D70%26rft.au%3DOzzola%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DCavallo%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DNeto%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+ANTENNAS+AND+PROPAGATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/TAP.2021.3090536,"Couplings,Antenna arrays,Mutual coupling,Green's function methods,Antenna radiation patterns,Current distribution,Current,Antenna arrays,beam coupling factor,multiple beams,mutual coupling,wideband arrays","MIMO,PERFORMANCE,IMPEDANCE,DIVERSITY",,"Fac Elect Engn Math & Comp Sci, Microelect Dept, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands"
7,7,"Schmidt, SI",May 2007 ,"Does groundwater influence the sediment fauna beneath a small, sandy stream?",LIMNOLOGICA,"Gradients in the sediment fauna comprising groundwater (GW) and hyporheic taxa were investigated in the sand/ silt-bottomed Marbling Brook in Western Australia. The structure of sediment invertebrate assemblages from Marbling Brook sediments and the adjacent GW were studied at five sites over I year and hydrological interactions were characterized using a suite of abiotic factors. Although all five stream sites were upwelling, the sites differed in the degree of hydrological interactions between GW and surface water. Sediment fauna taxa abundances were not correlated with any of the abiotic factors investigated and did not change gradually with depth. Faunal assemblages in the stream sediments were distinct from faunal assemblages in alluvial GW. While water exchanged between alluvial GW and sediment water, as shown by abiotic factors, the distinct differences in faunal assemblages indicated an unpredicted complexity in the catchment with fundamentally different hydrogeological situations on the decimetre scale. Sampling in sandy sediments needs to take this small-scale variability into account. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

8,8,"Wang, X",Aug 2012 ,Long-distance electrical coupling via tunneling nanotubes,BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOMEMBRANES,"Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are nanoscaled. F-actin containing membrane tubes that connect cells over several cell diameters. They facilitate the intercellular exchange of diverse components ranging from small molecules to organelles and pathogens. In conjunction with recent findings that TNT-like structures exist in tissue, they are expected to have important implications in cell-to-cell communication. In this review we will focus on a new function of TNTs, namely the transfer of electrical signals between remote cells. This electrical coupling is not only determined by the biophysical properties of the TNT, but depends on the presence of connexons interposed at the membrane interface between TNT and the connected cell Specific features of this coupling are compared to conventional gap junction communication. Finally, we will discuss possible down-stream signaling pathways of this electrical coupling in the recipient cells and their putative effects on different physiological activities.

Second, the nitrogen concentrations in the middle stream were much higher than those in the upper stream, and close to those in the lower stream. Third, the nitrogen species in the upper stream were mainly related to fertiliser, mostly connected with domestic sewage and fertiliser in the middle stream, and principally induced by industrial wastewater in the lower stream. Fourth, the amount of total nitrogen, dissolved nitrogen, solid nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen transported to the Bohai Sea by the Yellow River averaged 101.2, 94.6, 6.6, and 81.8 thousand tons, respectively, during the period of 2005 to 2007.

10,10,"Humston, R",Feb 2017 ,Isotope geochemistry reveals ontogeny of dispersal and exchange between main-river and tributary habitats in smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu,JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,"Radiogenic strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87:Sr-86) in otoliths were compared with isotope ratios predicted from models and observed in water sampling to reconstruct the movement histories of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu between main-river and adjacent tributary habitats. A mechanistic model incorporating isotope geochemistry, weathering processes and basin accumulation reasonably predicted observed river Sr-87:Sr-86 across the study area and provided the foundations for experimental design and inferring fish provenance. Exchange between rivers occurred frequently, with nearly half (48%) of the 209 individuals displaying changes in otolith Sr-87:Sr-86 reflecting movement between isotopically distinct rivers. The majority of between-river movements occurred in the first year and often within the first few months of life. Although more individuals were observed moving from the main river into tributaries, this pattern did not necessarily reflect asymmetry in exchange. Several individuals made multiple movements between rivers over their lifetimes; no patterns were found, however, that suggest seasonal or migratory movement. The main-river sport fishery is strongly supported by recruitment from tributary spawning, as 26% of stock size individuals in the main river were spawned in tributaries. The prevailing pattern of early juvenile dispersal documented in this study has not been observed previously for this species and suggests that the process of establishing seasonal home-range areas occurs up to 2years earlier than originally hypothesized. Extensive exchange between rivers would have substantial implications for management of M. dolomieu populations in river-tributary networks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000395632400005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIsotope%2Bgeochemistry%2Breveals%2Bontogeny%2Bof%2Bdispersal%2Band%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Bmain-river%2Band%2Btributary%2Bhabitats%2Bin%2Bsmallmouth%2Bbass%2BMicropterus%2Bdolomieu%26rft.aufirst%3DR.%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DHumston%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fjfb.13073%26rft.eissn%3D1095-8649%26rft.epage%3D548%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1112%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISH%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D528-548%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D528%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BFISH%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D90%26rft.au%3DHumston%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DDoss%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DBataille%252C%2BCP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+FISH+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/jfb.13073,"fish movement,otolith chemistry,river networks,strontium isotope ratio","WESTSLOPE CUTTHROAT TROUT,OTOLITH MICROCHEMISTRY,POTENTIAL IMPACTS,RAINBOW-TROUT,NATAL ORIGINS,BROOK TROUT,STRONTIUM,WATER,HETEROGENEITY,MOVEMENTS",,"Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Biol, 204 West Washington St, Lexington, VA 24450 USA"

However, our understanding of how bacteria are transported through these same networks is limited. Here, we applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to over 500 soil, stream water and stream sediment samples collected within a native forest catchment to determine the extent to which bacterial communities in these habitats are connected. We provide evidence that while the bacterial communities in each habitat were significantly distinct from one another (PERMANOVA pairwise P < 0.001), the bacterial communities in soil and stream samples were weakly connected to each other when stream sediment sample locations were downhill of surface runoff flow paths. This pattern decreased with increasing distance between the soil and sediment samples. The connectivity between soil and stream water samples was less apparent and extremely transient; the greatest similarity between bacterial communities in soil and stream water overall was when comparing stream samples collected 1 week post soil sampling. This study shows how bacterial communities in soil, stream water and stream sediments are connected at small spatial scales and provides rare insights into the temporal dynamics of terrestrial and aquatic bacterial community connectivity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000489528100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConnecting%2Bthrough%2Bspace%2Band%2Btime%253A%2Bcatchment-scale%2Bdistributions%2Bof%2Bbacteria%2Bin%2Bsoil%252C%2Bstream%2Bwater%2Band%2Bsediment%26rft.aufirst%3DSyrie%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DHermans%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1462-2920.14792%26rft.eissn%3D1462-2920%26rft.epage%3D1010%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1462-2912%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMICROBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1000-1010%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1000%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMICROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DHermans%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DBuckley%252C%2BHL%26rft.au%3DLear%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MICROBIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/1462-2920.14792,,"BIOGEOGRAPHY,COMMUNITIES,DIVERSITY,PATTERNS,BACTERIOPLANKTON,DISPERSAL,DYNAMICS,HISTORY,LAKES,FLOW",,"Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, 3A Symonds St, Auckland, New Zealand"

We present flexible filters, a load-balancing optimization technique for stream programs. Flexible filters utilize the programmability of the cores in order to improve the data-processing throughput of individual bottleneck tasks by ""borrowing"" resources from neighbors in the stream. Our technique is distributed and scalable because all runtime load-balancing decisions are based on point-to-point handshake signals exchanged between neighboring cores. Load balancing with flexible filters increases the system-level processing throughput of stream applications, particularly those with large dynamic variations in the computational load of their tasks.

We assessed efficiency of that survey, with intent to inform development of assessments at other connecting channels. We evaluated trends in community composition, effort versus estimates of species richness, ability to detect abundance changes for four species, and effects of subsampling yellow perch catches on size and age-structure metrics. Efficiency analysis revealed low power to detect changes in species abundance, whereas reduced effort could be considered to index species richness. Subsampling simulations indicated that subsampling would have allowed reliable estimates of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) population structure, while greatly reducing the number of fish that were assigned ages. Analyses of statistical power and efficiency of current sampling protocols are useful for managers collecting and using these types of data as well as for the development of new monitoring programs. Our approach provides insight into whether survey goals and objectives were being attained and can help evaluate ability of surveys to answer novel questions that arise as management strategies are refined.

15,15,"Oviedo-Vargas, D",Oct 2016 ,Chamber measurements of high CO2 emissions from a rainforest stream receiving old C-rich regional groundwater,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Carbon emissions from fluvial systems are a key component of local and regional carbon cycles. We used floating chambers to investigate the CO2 flux from stream water to air () in the Arboleda, a stream in the lowland rainforest of Costa Rica, fed partly by old regional groundwater high in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Drifting and static chambers showed averaging 35.5 and 72.7 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1), respectively, bracketing the previously-published value of 56 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) obtained using tracer methods in this stream. These values are much higher than most data in the literature and reflect a large flux of deep crustal (non-biogenic) CO2 out of the Arboleda, a flux that does not represent a component of ecosystem respiration. Static chambers appeared to overestimate by creating artificial turbulence, while drifting chambers may have underestimated by under-sampling areas of potentially high gas exchange (e.g., riffles around coarse woody debris obstructions). Both static and drifting chambers revealed high spatial heterogeneity in at the scale of 5-30 m reaches. Some observed temporal trends were localized, e.g., among three reaches with repeated measurements through the wet and dry seasons, (1) only the reach located between the other two showed significantly lower during the dry season, and (2) the highest and lowest were consistently observed in the reaches farthest upstream and downstream, respectively. Streams like the Arboleda receiving significant inputs of high-DIC regional groundwater merit additional study as hotspots for C emissions from terrestrial ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000387274300006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DChamber%2Bmeasurements%2Bof%2Bhigh%2BCO2%2Bemissions%2Bfrom%2Ba%2Brainforest%2Bstream%2Breceiving%2Bold%2BC-rich%2Bregional%2Bgroundwater%26rft.aufirst%3DDiana%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DOviedo-Vargas%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-016-0243-3%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D83%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D69-83%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D69%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D130%26rft.au%3DOviedo-Vargas%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DDierick%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DOberbauer%252C%2BSF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10533-016-0243-3,"Stream,Carbon dioxide,Chamber,Emissions,Flux,Regional groundwater,Gas exchange","CARBON-DIOXIDE,GAS-EXCHANGE,SURFACE WATERS,EVASION,RIVER,DYNAMICS,PEATLAND,FLUXES,PCO(2),FLOW",,"North Carolina State Univ, Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA"
16,16,"Yang, S",Dec 20 2019 ,Spatial patterns of water quality impairments from point source nutrient loads in Germany's largest national River Basin (Weser River),SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"We employed the well-established Horton-Strahler, hierarchical, stream-order (omega) scheme to investigate scaling of nutrient loads (P and N) from similar to 845 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) distributed along the river network in urbanized Weser River, the largest national basin in Germany (similar to 46K km(2); similar to 8.4 million population). We estimated hydrologic and water quality impacts at the reach- and basin-scales, at two steady river discharge conditions (median flow, Q(R50); low-flow, Q(R90)). Of the five WWTPs class-sizes (1 <= k <= 5), similar to 68% discharge to small low-order streams (omega < 3). We found large variations in capacity to dilute WWTP nutrient loads because of variability in (1) treated wastewater discharge (Q(U)) within and among different class-sizes, and (2) river discharge (Q(R)) within low-order streams (omega < 3) resulting from differences in drainage areas. For Q(R50), reach-scalewater quality impairment assessed by nutrient concentration was likely at 136 (similar to 16%) locations for P and 15 locations (similar to 2%) for N. About 90% of these locationswere lower-order streams (omega < 3). At Q(R50) and only with dilution, basin-scale cumulative nutrient loads from multiple upstream WWTPs increase impaired locations to 266 (similar to 32% of total) for P. Considering in-stream uptake decreased P-impaired streams to 225 (similar to 27%), suggesting the dominant role of dilution in the Weser River basin. Role of in-stream uptake diminished along the flow paths, while dilution in larger streams (4 <= omega <= 7) minimizes the impact of WWTP loads. Under Q(R90) conditions [(Q(R50)/Q(R90)) similar to 2.5], water quality impaired locations will likely double for the basin-scale analyses. Long-term water quality data suggested that diffuse sources are the primary contributors for water quality impairments in large streams. Our data-modeling synthesis approach is transferable to other urbanized river basins and extends understanding of point source impacts on water quality across spatial scales. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Rapid population growth over the past few decades has driven an increase in groundwater abstraction from aquifers under the city. Study focus: This study exeplores the pumping-induced water exchange between the River Ganges and groundwater under transient conditions between 2009 and 2015, using a numerical simulation. The deterministic water exchange model within an uncertainty quantification was used to reveal the controlling factors affecting river water infiltration. New hydrological insights for the region: Modelling reveals that under baseline (eno pumping) conditions, the dominant (~ 91% of the year) flow direction is from the aquifer to the river, which reverses (~ 9% of the year) when the river stage is high. When a municipal pumping well is implemented, river water infiltration into the aquifer increases to 68% of the year. The groundwater pumping rate is found to be the most important factor affecting the river water infiltration, whilst the groundwater table level is most sensitive to the well distance from the river, followed by pumping rate. Optimizing the location, depth and pumping rate of new wells in the area could mitigate fluvial contamination of the aquifer and help maintain groundwater levels.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000822695600006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B101133%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bthe%2Bimpacts%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%2Babstraction%2Bon%2BGanges%2Briver%2Bwater%2Binfiltration%2Binto%2Bshallow%2Baquifers%2Bunder%2Bthe%2Brapidly%2Bdeveloping%2Bcity%2Bof%2BPatna%252C%2BIndia%26rft.aufirst%3DChuanhe%26rft.auinit%3DCH%26rft.aulast%3DLu%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ejrh.2022.101133%26rft.eissn%3D2214-5818%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY-REGIONAL%2BSTUDIES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL-REG%2BSTUD%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BCH%26rft.au%3DRichards%252C%2BLA%26rft.au%3DNiasar%252C%2BVJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL+STUDIES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101133,"Groundwater,Water exchange,Abstraction,River water infiltration,Sensitivity analysis","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,RESIDENCE TIMES,URBAN AREAS,FLOW,SEDIMENT,DENITRIFICATION,EFFICIENCY,TRANSPORT,DISCHARGE,SYSTEM",,"Univ Manchester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Williamson Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, England"
18,18,"Iribar, A",Feb 2008 ,Differentiated free-living and sediment-attached bacterial community structure inside and outside denitrification hotspots in the river-groundwater interface,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"This study assessed the functional significance of attached and free-living bacterial communities involved in the process of denitrification in a shallow aquifer of a riparian zone (Garonne River, SW France). Denitrification enzyme activity (DEA), bacterial density (BD) and bacterial community composition (BCC) were measured in two aquifer compartments: the groundwater and the sandy fraction of the sediment deposit. Samples were collected in wells located inside (IHD) and outside (OHD) identified hotspots of denitrification. Despite high BD values (up to 1.14 x 10(12) cells m(-3)), DEA was not detected in the water compartment (< 0.32 mg N-N2O m(-3) d-(1)). The sandy fraction showed detectable DEA (up to 1,389 mg N-N2O m(-3) d-1) and, consistent with BD pattern, higher DEA values were measured in IHD zones than in OHD zones. The BCC assessed by 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) partly supported this result: attached and free-living communities were significantly different (< 30% similarity) but patterns of BCC did not cluster according to IHD and OHD zones. Targeting the denitrifying communities by means of a culture enrichment step prior to 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE showed that the free-living and sediment attached communities differed. Most sequences obtained from DGGE profiles of denitrifying communities were affiliated to Proteobacteria and showed low genetic distance with taxa that have already been detected in aquifers (e.g., Azoarcus sp., Acidovorax sp. and Pseudomonas spp.). This study confirms that in the aquifer the sediment-attached fraction exhibits different functions (DEA) from free-living communities and suggests that this functional difference is related to the communities' structure.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000251874300009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDifferentiated%2Bfree-living%2Band%2Bsediment-attached%2Bbacterial%2Bcommunity%2Bstructure%2Binside%2Band%2Boutside%2Bdenitrification%2Bhotspots%2Bin%2Bthe%2Briver-groundwater%2Binterface%26rft.aufirst%3DAmaia%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DIribar%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-007-9143-9%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D121%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D109-121%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D109%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D598%26rft.au%3DIribar%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSanchez-Perez%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DGarabetian%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-007-9143-9,"river interface,Garonne River,alluvial groundwater,biofilms,colonization,denitrifiers,hyporheic zone,connected aquifer","MOLECULAR MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA,NITRATE CONCENTRATION,GARONNE RIVER,FLOODPLAIN,DIVERSITY,GRADIENT,DYNAMICS,WATER,ZONE",,"Univ Toulouse 3, EcoLab Lab Ecol Fonct, CNRS, UMR 5245,UPS,INPT, Batiment 4R3 B2,118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France"
19,19,"Akbarzadeh, Z",Jul 1 2018 ,Benthic nitrite exchanges in the Seine River (France): An early diagenetic modeling analysis,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Nitrite is a toxic intermediate compound in the nitrogen (N) cycle. Elevated concentrations of nitrite have been observed in the Seine River, raising questions about its sources and fate. Here, we assess the role of bottom sediments as potential sources or sinks of nitrite along the river continuum. Sediment cores were collected from two depocenters, one located upstream, the other downstream, from the largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) servicing the conurbation of Paris. Pore water profiles of oxygen, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium were measured. Ammonium, nitrate and nitrite fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) were determined in separate core incubation experiments. The data were interpreted with a one-dimensional, multi-component reactive transport model, which accounts for the production and consumption of nitrite through nitrification, denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). In all core incubation experiments, nitrate uptake by the sediments was observed, indicative of high rates of denitrification. In contrast, for both sampling locations, the sediments in cores collected in August 2012 acted as sinks for nitrite, but those collected in October 2013 released nitrite to the overlying water. The model results suggest that the first step of nitrification generated most pore water nitrite at the two locations. While nitrification was also the main pathway consuming nitrite in the sediments upstream of the WWTP, anammox dominated nitrite removal at the downstream site. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the magnitude and direction of the benthic nitrite fluxes most strongly depend on bottom water oxygenation and the deposition flux of labile organic matter.

This study aims to investigate the potential impacts of land use and climate change on the hydrology of the Bago River Basin in Myanmar. Two scenarios from the representative concentration pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) were used to project the future climate of 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. Six general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were selected to project the future climate in the basin. An increase of average temperature in the range of 0.7 to 1.5 A degrees C and 0.9 to 2.7 A degrees C was observed under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, in future periods. Similarly, average annual precipitation shows a distinct increase in all three periods with the highest increase in 2050s. A well calibrated and validated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the land use and climate change impacts on future stream flows in the basin. It is observed that the impact of climate change on stream flow is higher than the land use change in the near future. The combined impacts of land use and climate change can increase the annual stream flow up to 68 % in the near future. The findings of this study would be beneficial to improve land and water management decisions and in formulating adaptation strategies to reduce the negative impacts, and harness the positive impacts of land use and climate change in the Bago River Basin.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000387668000009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLand%2BUse%2Band%2BClimate%2BChange%2BImpacts%2Bon%2Bthe%2BHydrology%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBago%2BRiver%2BBasin%252C%2BMyanmar%26rft.aufirst%3DSangam%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DShrestha%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10666-016-9511-9%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2967%26rft.epage%3D833%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1420-2026%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMODELING%2B%2526%2BASSESSMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D819-833%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D819%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMODEL%2BASSESS%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DShrestha%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DHtut%252C%2BAY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MODELING+%26+ASSESSMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10666-016-9511-9,"Climate change,Land use change,Stream flows,RCPs,Bago River Basin","CHANGE SCENARIOS,WATER,STREAMFLOW,MODEL",,"Asian Inst Technol, Sch Engn & Technol, Water Engn & Management, POB 4, Klongluang 12120, Pathumthani, Thailand"
21,21,"Tang, Q",Dec 2015 ,Characterisation of river-aquifer exchange fluxes: The role of spatial patterns of riverbed hydraulic conductivities,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Interactions between surface water and groundwater play an essential role in hydrology, hydrogeology, ecology, and water resources management. A proper characterisation of riverbed structures might be important for estimating river aquifer exchange fluxes. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is commonly used in subsurface flow and transport modelling for estimating states and parameters. However, EnKF only performs optimally for MultiGaussian distributed parameter fields, but the spatial distribution of streambed hydraulic conductivities often shows non-MultiGaussian patterns, which are related to flow velocity dependent sedimentation and erosion processes. In this synthetic study, we assumed a riverbed with non-MultiGaussian channel-distributed hydraulic parameters as a virtual reference. The synthetic study was carried out for a 3-D river aquifer model with a river in hydraulic connection to a homogeneous aquifer. Next, in a series of data assimilation experiments three different groups of scenarios were studied. In the first and second group of scenarios, stochastic realisations of non-MultiGaussian distributed riverbeds were inversely conditioned to state information, using EnKF and the normal score ensemble Kalman filter (NS-EnKF). The riverbed hydraulic conductivity was oriented in the form of channels (first group of scenarios) or, with the same bimodal histogram, without channelling (second group of scenarios). In the third group of scenarios, the stochastic realisations of riverbeds have MultiGaussian distributed hydraulic parameters and are conditioned to state information with EnKF. It was found that the best results were achieved for channel-distributed non-MultiGaussian stochastic realisations and with parameter updating. However, differences between the simulations were small and non-MultiGaussian riverbed properties seem to be of less importance for subsurface flow than non-MultiGaussian aquifer properties. In addition, it was concluded that both EnKF and NS-EnKF improve the characterisation of non-MultiGaussian riverbed properties, hydraulic heads and exchange fluxes by piezometric head assimilation, and only NS-EnKF could preserve the initial distribution of riverbed hydraulic conductivities.

22,22,"Zhou, Y",Jun 2018 ,Groundwater flux estimation in streams: A thermal equilibrium approach,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Stream and groundwater interactions play an essential role in regulating flow, temperature, and water quality for stream ecosystems. Temperature gradients have been used to quantify vertical water movement in the streambed since the 1960s, but advancements in thermal methods are still possible. Seepage runs are a method commonly used to quantify exchange rates through a series of streamflow measurements but can be labor and time intensive. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a thermal equilibrium method as a technique for quantifying groundwater flux using monitored stream water temperature at a single point and readily available hydrological and atmospheric data. Our primary assumption was that stream water temperature at the monitored point was at thermal equilibrium with the combination of all heat transfer processes, including mixing with groundwater. By expanding the monitored stream point into a hypothetical, horizontal one-dimensional thermal modeling domain, we were able to simulate the thermal equilibrium achieved with known atmospheric variables at the point and quantify unknown groundwater flux by calibrating the model to the resulting temperature signature. Stream water temperatures were monitored at single points at nine streams in the Ozark Highland ecoregion and five reaches of the Kiamichi River to estimate groundwater fluxes using the thermal equilibrium method. When validated by comparison with seepage runs performed at the same time and reach, estimates from the two methods agreed with each other with an R-2 of 0.94, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.08 (m/d) and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.93. In conclusion, the thermal equilibrium method was a suitable technique for quantifying groundwater flux with minimal cost and simple field installation given that suitable atmospheric and hydrological data were readily available.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000439401800063,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater%2Bflux%2Bestimation%2Bin%2Bstreams%253A%2BA%2Bthermal%2Bequilibrium%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DYan%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DZhou%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2018.04.001%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.epage%3D832%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D822-832%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D822%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D561%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DFox%252C%2BGA%26rft.au%3DBrewer%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.001,"Groundwater flux,Thermal equilibrium,Seepage run,Stream water temperature,Temperature signature","TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIP,ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE,SURFACE-TEMPERATURE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,WATER TEMPERATURE,FLOW,HEAT,SCALE,RIVER,CATCHMENT",,"North Carolina State Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Campus Box 7625, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA"

It fulfils the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). It allows the assessment of both lowland rivers as well as mid-altitude and highland streams. The proposed system can be used to assess the natural and heavily modified rivers as well as artificial channels. The basis of the proposed system is a field survey, which is supplemented by the analysis of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data and remote sensing materials. The analysis of the GIS data and remote sensing materials already enable to estimate preliminary classification of the hydromorphological status of the non-surveyed water bodies. On the basis of the field survey, the principal HIR value can be estimated for the considered river site and comparing with the reference conditions, the hydromorphological quality status in the five-class system can be calculated. The properly selected, representative survey sites (one or more depending on the heterogeneity of the environment), enable the classification and evaluation of entire surface water bodies in the framework of the national environmental monitoring. The GIS component of the HIR proved to be useful in verifying the determination of heavily modified water bodies and in assessing the needs of river restoration. It was also applied in the development of the National river restoration program for predicting the impact of the proposed restoration measure on the state of hydromorphology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000576800000012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydromorphological%2BIndex%2Bfor%2BRivers%2B%2528HIR%2529%253A%2BA%2BNew%2BMethod%2Bfor%2BHydromorphological%2BAssessment%2Band%2BClassification%2Bfor%2BFlowing%2BWaters%2Bin%2BPoland%26rft.aufirst%3DKrzysztof%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DSzoszkiewicz%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.12911%252F22998993%252F126879%26rft.epage%3D271%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2299-8993%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BECOLOGICAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D261-271%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D261%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BECOL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DSzoszkiewicz%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DJusik%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DSzostak%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ECOLOGICAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.12911/22998993/126879,"hydromorphology,rivers,streams,monitoring,surface water classification,flowing water",,,"Poznan Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Protect, Ul Wojska Polskiego 28, PL-60624 Poznan, Poland"
24,24,"Wu, JY",Nov 2015 ,"Watershed features and stream water quality: Gaining insight through path analysis in a Midwest urban landscape, USA",LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,"Urban stream condition is often degraded by human activities in the surrounding watershed. Given the complexity of urban areas, relationships among variables that cause stream degradation can be difficult to isolate. We examined factors affecting stream condition by evaluating social, terrestrial, stream hydrology and water quality variables from 20 urban stream watersheds in central Iowa, U.S.A. We used path analysis to examine and quantify social and ecological factors related to variation in stream conditions. Path models supported hypotheses that stream water quality was influenced by variables in each category. Specifically, one path model indicated that increased stream water conductivity was linked to high road density, which itself was associated with high human population density. A second path model revealed nitrogen concentration in stream water was positively related to watershed area covered by cropland, and that cropland increased as human population density declined. A third path model indicated phosphorus concentration in stream water declined as percent of watershed residents with college education increased, although the mechanism underlying this relationship was unclear and could have been an artifact of lower soil-derived nutrient input from watersheds dominated by paved surfaces. To improve environmental conditions in urban streams, land use planning strategies should include limiting or reducing road density near streams, installing treatment trains for surface water runoff associated with roads, and establishing vegetated buffer zones to reduce inputs of road salt and other pollutants. Additionally, education/outreach should be conducted with residents to increase understanding of how their own behaviors influence stream water quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

25,25,"Bowling, LC",Dec 2013 ,"Effects of hydrology and river management on the distribution, abundance and persistence of cyanobacterial blooms in the Murray River, Australia",HARMFUL ALGAE,"Major cyanobacterial blooms (biovolume > 4 mm(3) L-1) occurred in the main water reservoirs on the upper Murray River, Australia during February and March 2010. Cyanobacterial-infested water was released and contaminated rivers downstream. River flow velocities were sufficiently high that in-stream bloom development was unlikely. The location has a temperate climate but experienced drought in 2010, causing river flows that were well below the long-term median values. This coupled with very low bed gradients meant turbulence was insufficient to destroy the cyanobacteria in-stream. Blooms in the upper 500 km of the Murray and Edward Rivers persisted for 5 weeks, but in the mid and lower Murray blooms were confined to a small package of water that moved progressively downstream for another 650 km. Anabaena circinalis was the dominant species present, confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, but other potentially toxic species were also present in smaller amounts. Saxitoxin (sxtA), microcystin (mcyE) and cylindrospermopsin (aoaA) biosynthesis genes were also detected, although water sample analysis rarely detected these toxins. River water temperature and nutrient concentrations were optimal for bloom survival. The operational design of weirs and retention times within weir pools, as well as tributary inflows to and diversions from the Murray River all influenced the distribution and persistence of the blooms. Similar flow, water quality and river regulation factors were underlying causes of another bloom in these rivers in 2009. Global climate change is likely to promote future blooms in this and other lowland rivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

26,26,"Knights, D",Jan 2017 ,Tidal controls on riverbed denitrification along a tidal freshwater zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In coastal rivers, tidal pumping enhances the exchange of oxygen-rich river water across the sediment-water interface, controlling nitrogen cycling in riverbed sediment. We developed a one-dimensional, fluid flow and solute transport model that quantifies the influence of tidal pumping on nitrate removal and applied it to the tidal freshwater zone (TFZ) of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA). In field observations and models, both oxygenated river water and anoxic groundwater deliver nitrate to carbon-rich riverbed sediment. A zone of nitrate removal forms beneath the aerobic interval, which expands and contracts over daily timescales due to tidal pumping. At high tide when oxygen-rich river water infiltrates into the bed, denitrification rates decrease by 25% relative to low tide. In the absence of tidal pumping, our model predicts that the aerobic zone would be thinner, and denitrification rates would increase by 10%. As tidal amplitude increases toward the coast, nitrate removal rates should decrease due to enhanced oxygen exchange across the sediment-water interface, based on sensitivity analysis. Denitrification hot spots in TFZs are more likely to occur in less permeable sediment under lower tidal ranges and higher rates of ambient groundwater discharge. Our models suggest that tidal pumping is not efficient at removing surface water nitrate but can remove up to 81% of nitrate from discharging groundwater in the TFZ of White Clay Creek. Given the high population densities of coastal watersheds, the reactive riverbeds of TFZs play a critical role in mitigating new nitrogen loads to coasts.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394911200047,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTidal%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Briverbed%2Bdenitrification%2Balong%2Ba%2Btidal%2Bfreshwater%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DDeon%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DKnights%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019405%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D816%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D799-816%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D799%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DKnights%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DBray%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR019405,"tidal freshwater zone,coastal rivers,water quality,hyporheic exchange,tidal pumping","DISSIMILATORY NITRATE REDUCTION,COASTAL MARINE ECOSYSTEMS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,SHINGOBEE RIVER,ORGANIC-CARBON,RIPARIAN ZONE,NITROGEN,GROUNDWATER,TRANSPORT,SEDIMENT",,"Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA"
27,27,"Garcia, XF",Apr 2012 ,Complex hydromorphology of meanders can support benthic invertebrate diversity in rivers,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"In freshwater environments, high biodiversity is commonly associated with habitat heterogeneity. River bends and meanders are particularly complex morphodynamic elements of watercourses. However, the specific spatio-temporal interactions between hydromorphology and the resident biota have scarcely been studied. This article reviews the relationships between hydraulic processes, and morphological units that are typical for meanders, and analyzes the concomitant spatial and temporal dynamics of habitats suitable for aquatic invertebrates. Flow in river bends is characterized by significant cross-stream velocities, which modify primary flow patterns, and create helical flow trajectories. Consequently, boundary shear stresses at the river-bed are altered, so that complex erosion, transport, and accumulation processes characteristically shape bed and bank morphology. The diversity of substrate types and complex bathymetry in meanders provide a large variety of habitat conditions for benthic invertebrates within a relatively small spatial domain, which are connected via hydraulic pathways. Periodic reversal of hydro-morphological processes between low and high flow, and seasonal growth of aquatic macrophytes creates spatio-temporal dynamics at the meso- and microhabitat scales. Such habitat dynamics increases benthic invertebrate diversity to the extent it is consistent with spatio-temporal scales of invertebrate mobility and life cycle. Furthermore, the presence of flow refugia, and hydraulic dead zones in meanders is essential to sustain species richness. This study concludes that meanders are highly complex morphodynamic elements that exhibit several self-regulating principles supporting invertebrate diversity and resilience in fluvial ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000300673500004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DComplex%2Bhydromorphology%2Bof%2Bmeanders%2Bcan%2Bsupport%2Bbenthic%2Binvertebrate%2Bdiversity%2Bin%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DX-F%26rft.auinit%3DXF%26rft.aulast%3DGarcia%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-011-0905-z%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D68%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D49-68%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D49%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D685%26rft.au%3DGarcia%252C%2BXF%26rft.au%3DSchnauder%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DPusch%252C%2BMT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-011-0905-z,"River bends,Flow dynamics,Habitat heterogeneity,Flow refugia,Ecosystem resilience,River restoration","INTERMEDIATE DISTURBANCE HYPOTHESIS,HABITAT HETEROGENEITY,FLOW REFUGIA,MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,STREAM HABITAT,PATCH DYNAMICS,LOWLAND RIVER,AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATE,ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS,LOTIC MACROINVERTEBRATES",,"Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Limnol Shallow Lakes & Lowland Rivers, Muggelseedamm 301, D-12587 Berlin, Germany"
28,28,"Aristegi, L",Nov 2009 ,"Comparison of several methods to calculate reaeration in streams, and their effects on estimation of metabolism",HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Metabolism is an integrative measurement of stream and river ecosystem functioning, and thus, could be used to assess impairment. Stream metabolism is measured by different methods which often yield contrasting results. Furthermore, open-channel measurements of metabolism, which offer the best potential for continuous monitoring of stream functioning, rely on calculations of gas exchange with the atmosphere, for which a plethora of methods exists. Therefore, to incorporate metabolism in stream monitoring programs, it is necessary to determine which methods yield comparable results under a given set of environmental conditions. We studied 21 streams in the Basque Country (northern Spain), ranging widely in physical characteristics and water quality. We calculated reaeration during summer baseflows using three different approaches: the night-time drop in oxygen, the lag between noon and peak oxygen concentration, and ten empirical equations relating depth and velocity with reaeration coefficients obtained from the literature. Differences among methods were very large, especially at the shallower sites. The results obtained with most empirical equations were highly correlated, but showed little agreement with the night-time and peak lag methods. We then analyzed the response of reaeration rate to river stage: reaeration calculated by the night-time method during 1 year of continuous monitoring was regressed against discharge at each site, and the resulting model was compared to the results of empirical equations, using software HecRas 2.2 to model hydraulic conditions at different river stages. The shape of reaeration-discharge plots differed greatly and in a site-dependent manner, and there was little agreement between methods. Finally, we investigated the effects of reaeration rate on estimates of metabolism. The choice of method greatly affected the estimates of both primary production and respiration. The empirical equations, except E-7 and E-10, yielded the most unrealistic estimations of stream metabolism. Overall, the night-time method, especially when regressed against discharge, seems to be the most robust and reliable among those tested, with the energy dissipation method (E-10) appearing to be a viable alternative when the night-time method does not work.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000270652200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DComparison%2Bof%2Bseveral%2Bmethods%2Bto%2Bcalculate%2Breaeration%2Bin%2Bstreams%252C%2Band%2Btheir%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bestimation%2Bof%2Bmetabolism%26rft.aufirst%3DLide%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DAristegi%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-009-9904-8%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D124%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D113-124%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D113%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D635%26rft.au%3DAristegi%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DIzagirre%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DElosegi%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-009-9904-8,"Metabolism,Stream,Reaeration,Methods,Gross primary production,Respiration","ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,RESPIRATION,PRODUCTIVITY,INDICATORS,BREAKDOWN",,"Univ Basque Country, Fac Sci & Technol, POB 644, Bilbao 48080, Spain"

30,30,"Ran, XB",Oct 2013 ,Silicon and sediment transport of the Changjiang River (Yangtze River): could the Three Gorges Reservoir be a filter?,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Water samples were collected from the Changjiang River (Yangtze River) in May 2005, after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), to examine the influence of the TGR and large lakes on material delivery to the estuary of the Changjiang River. The concentrations of suspended particle material (SPM), dissolved silica (DSi) and biogenic silica (BSi) in the main stream were analyzed. The concentrations of DSi and BSi in the main channel of the Changjiang varied between 73 and 100 and 1.1-15 mu mol/l, with a distance weighted average of 81 and 8.0 mu mol/l, respectively. A calculation shows that live diatom comprises only an average value of 5.2 % of the BSi in the Changjiang River, and most of BSi may come from drainage basin. The concentrations of BSi and the ratios of BSi/SPM were relatively low in the Changjiang River compared to other rivers throughout the world, but the BSi carried in suspension by the Changjiang River was an important component of the rivers silicon load (i.e. similar to 13 %). SPM, DSi and BSi concentrations as observed in the Changjiang River tend to decrease from the upper sections of the river to the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), reflecting sedimentation associated with BSi trapping and DSi retention in the TGR in the normal-water period. SPM and BSi retention are more strongly influenced by the TGD compared to DSi. About 98 % of SPM, 72 % of BSi and 16 % of DSi were retained within the TGR in May 2005. The fluxes variations of DSi, BSi and SPM suggested that the large lakes and dams had a coupled effect on the transportation of DSi, BSi and SPM in the normal-water period. Such a change in silicon (DSi and BSi) balances of the Changjiang River will affect the ecological environment of the Changjiang estuary and its adjacent sea to some extent.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000325074400037,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSilicon%2Band%2Bsediment%2Btransport%2Bof%2Bthe%2BChangjiang%2BRiver%2B%2528Yangtze%2BRiver%2529%253A%2Bcould%2Bthe%2BThree%2BGorges%2BReservoir%2Bbe%2Ba%2Bfilter%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DXiangbin%26rft.auinit%3DXB%26rft.aulast%3DRan%2BXiangbin%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-013-2275-5%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.epage%3D1893%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1881-1893%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1881%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D70%26rft.au%3DRan%252C%2BXB%26rft.au%3DYu%252C%2BZG%26rft.au%3DGuo%252C%2BHB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-013-2275-5,"Dissolved silicon,Biogenic silica,SPM,Changjiang River (Yangtze River),Three Gorges Reservoir","GATE-I RESERVOIR,EAST CHINA SEA,BIOGENIC SILICA,DANUBE RIVER,COASTAL WATERS,SUSPENDED MATTER,BASIN RIVERS,BLACK-SEA,TRIBUTARIES,NUTRIENT",,"Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China"

32,32,"Cooper, SD",Feb 1998 ,Implications of scale for patterns and processes in stream ecology,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Although the scale-dependence of ecological patterns and processes is recognized by freshwater ecologists, current knowledge of scale effects is rudimentary and non-quantitative. We review issues of spatial and temporal scale in this paper to highlight conceptual problems relating to scale and some potential solutions. We present examples of how the spatial scale of a study influences observed patterns and their interpretation, and discuss how the size of an experimental arena influences the degree to which the dynamics of studied populations are influenced by exchange processes (immigration and emigration). The results of small-scale field experiments in streams will often be strongly influenced by the per capita exchange rates of organisms and differences in exchange rates may explain differences in the perceived effects of stream manipulations across scales. Spatial extent also influences the amount of spatial heterogeneity within a study site or arena, with important consequences for the outcome of predator-prey interactions. We suggest that changes in the availability of prey refuges may help explain why predator manipulations in streams appear to weaken as arena size increases. We also recommend that new techniques for decomposing and quantifying spatial heterogeneity be applied to characterize scale-dependent variation in freshwater systems. Lastly, we discuss the pitfalls of mismatching the temporal scale of experiments and models. Models incorporating spatial heterogeneity and the behaviour of organisms are needed to predict the short-term outcome of perturbations in streams, whereas models predicting long-term dynamics will need to integrate the impacts of episodic disturbance and all life history stages of organisms. In general, we recommend that freshwater ecologists undertake more multi-scale sampling and experimentation to examine patterns and processes at multiple scales, and make greater attempts to match the scales of their observations and experiments to the characteristic scales of the phenomena that they investigate.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000072219000003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImplications%2Bof%2Bscale%2Bfor%2Bpatterns%2Band%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Bstream%2Becology%26rft.aufirst%3DSD%26rft.auinit%3DSD%26rft.aulast%3DCooper%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1442-9993.1998.tb00703.x%26rft.epage%3D40%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0307-692X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAUSTRALIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D27-40%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D27%26rft.stitle%3DAUST%2BJ%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DCooper%252C%2BSD%26rft.au%3DDiehl%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DSarnelle%252C%2BO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=AUSTRALIAN+JOURNAL+OF+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1442-9993.1998.tb00703.x,"biological interactions,communities,freshwater,scale,stream ecology","RIVER FOOD WEBS,SIERRA-NEVADA STREAM,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,SUBSTRATE COMPOSITION,DENSITY-DEPENDENCE,CHIHUAHUAN-DESERT,PREY POPULATIONS,PREDATOR IMPACTS,SPATIAL SCALE,ARCTIC RIVER",,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA"
33,33,"Zhang, CY",Jun 2020 ,Acoustic Streaming Generated by Sharp Edges: The Coupled Influences of Liquid Viscosity and Acoustic Frequency,MICROMACHINES,"Acoustic streaming can be generated around sharp structures, even when the acoustic wavelength is much larger than the vessel size. This sharp-edge streaming can be relatively intense, owing to the strongly focused inertial effect experienced by the acoustic flow near the tip. We conducted experiments with particle image velocimetry to quantify this streaming flow through the influence of liquid viscosity nu, from 1 mm2/s to 30 mm2/s, and acoustic frequencyffrom 500 Hz to 3500 Hz. Both quantities supposedly influence the thickness of the viscous boundary layer delta = (nu/pi f)(1/2). For all situations, the streaming flow appears as a main central jet from the tip, generating two lateral vortices beside the tip and outside the boundary layer. As a characteristic streaming velocity, the maximal velocity is located at a distance of delta from the tip, and it increases as the square of the acoustic velocity. We then provide empirical scaling laws to quantify the influence of nu andfon the streaming velocity. Globally, the streaming velocity is dramatically weakened by a higher viscosity, whereas the flow pattern and the disturbance distance remain similar regardless of viscosity. Besides viscosity, the frequency also strongly influences the maximal streaming velocity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000551949800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B607%26rft.atitle%3DAcoustic%2BStreaming%2BGenerated%2Bby%2BSharp%2BEdges%253A%2BThe%2BCoupled%2BInfluences%2Bof%2BLiquid%2BViscosity%2Band%2BAcoustic%2BFrequency%26rft.aufirst%3DChuanyu%26rft.auinit%3DCY%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fmi11060607%26rft.eissn%3D2072-666X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DMICROMACHINES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DMICROMACHINES-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BCY%26rft.au%3DGuo%252C%2BXF%26rft.au%3DBrunet%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=MICROMACHINES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/mi11060607,"acoustofluidics,microfluidics,acoustic streaming,sharp edge,particle image velocimetry",CELL,,"Univ Paris, Lab Interdisciplinaire Energies Demain, UMR 8236, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France"
34,34,"Areepitak, T",Jul 1 2011 ,Model Simulations of Particle Aggregation Effect on Colloid Exchange between Streams and Streambeds,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Colloids found in natural streams have large reactive surface areas, which makes them significant absorbents and carriers for pollutants. Stream-subsurface exchange plays a critical role in regulating the transport of colloids and contaminants in natural streams. Previous process-based multiphase exchange models were developed without consideration of colloid colloid interaction. However, many studies have indicated that aggregation is a significant process and needs to be considered in stream process analysis. Herein, a new colloid exchange model was developed by including particle aggregation in addition to colloid settling and filtration. Self-preserving size distribution concepts and classical aggregation theory were employed to model the aggregation process. Model simulations indicate that under conditions of low filtration and high degree of particle particle interaction, aggregation could either decrease or increase the amount of colloids retained in streambeds, depending on the initial particle size. Thus, two possible cases may occur including enhanced colloid deposition and facilitated colloid transport. Also, when the aggregation rate is high and filtration increases, more particles are retained by bed sediments due to filtration, and fewer are aggregated, which reduces the extent of aggregation effect on colloid deposition. The work presented here will contribute to a better understanding and prediction of colloid transport phenomena in natural streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000292075100024,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModel%2BSimulations%2Bof%2BParticle%2BAggregation%2BEffect%2Bon%2BColloid%2BExchange%2Bbetween%2BStreams%2Band%2BStreambeds%26rft.aufirst%3DTrachu%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DAreepitak%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes200586v%26rft.epage%3D5621%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5614-5621%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5614%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DAreepitak%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es200586v,,"CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS,BROWNIAN MOTION,POROUS-MEDIA,WASTE-WATER,BED FORMS,SEDIMENT,CONTAMINANTS,COAGULATION",,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA"
35,35,"Ke, XM",Nov 2021 ,A saturated-unsaturated coupling model for groundwater flowing into seepage wells: a modeling study for groundwater development in river basins,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"As a major and popular groundwater extraction structure, seepage wells are often used to transfer river water into aquifers for harvesting water resources. It can help ameliorate the imbalance between supply and demand, in particular, in areas of water scarcity. Large drawdowns due to pumping may cause the river to disconnect from the groundwater and form an unsaturated zone, which seriously affects the efficiency of seepage wells. However, most of the current models of extraction structures of non-tube wells account for only saturated flow and do not consider unsaturated conditions. To address this limitation, a saturated-unsaturated coupling model was developed using the exchange flow rate between the well pipe and the aquifer as the coupling point. Moreover, the model was evaluated with physical simulation test data. The statistical results indicated that the model could estimate the drawdown and pumping rate well with root-mean-square deviations of 0.0114 m and 0.0079 L s(-1), respectively, for a river with strong leakage capacity; and 0.0129 m and 0.0099 L s(-1), respectively, for a river with weak leakage capacity. The critical drawdown, where the river disconnects from the aquifer, as well as variations of the unsaturated zone, was also discussed. The present study provides important information for the design of seepage wells with reasonable drawdown, while being able to predict the potential water yield, and at the same time help protect the groundwater environment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000708912800004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B711%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bsaturated-unsaturated%2Bcoupling%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bgroundwater%2Bflowing%2Binto%2Bseepage%2Bwells%253A%2Ba%2Bmodeling%2Bstudy%2Bfor%2Bgroundwater%2Bdevelopment%2Bin%2Briver%2Bbasins%26rft.aufirst%3DXianmin%26rft.auinit%3DXM%26rft.aulast%3DKe%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-021-10035-8%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D21%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D80%26rft.au%3DKe%252C%2BXM%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DHu%252C%2BHY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-021-10035-8,"Saturated-unsaturated coupling model,Groundwater,Unsaturated zone,Drawdown,Physical simulation test","RADIAL COLLECTOR WELL,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",,"Changan Univ, Sch Water & Environm, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China"
36,36,"Francis, RA",Oct 2012 ,THE FLORA OF URBAN RIVER WALLSCAPES,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Urban river walls represent some of the most common habitat available to riparian species within heavily engineered urban river corridors, but research into the characteristics and diversity of river walls is very rare. In this study, the flora of urban river walls was surveyed at 16 sites (92 walls) along 32 km of the river Thames through central London to determine the characteristics and habitat origins of species found on these walls, whether these species indicated an urban cliff effect occurring on wall habitats and whether plant species richness varied between different wall types. A total of 90 species were found on the walls, with the majority of species associated with disturbed areas and riparian habitats, supporting the idea of a mass effect occurring, whereby the flora is maintained by propagule pressure from remnant or introduced habitats within urban or peri-urban areas, rather than walls selecting for cliff/rock species. There was an increased incidence of plants from cliff/rock habitats found in the flora however, suggesting that an urban cliff effect does still occur. Species were organized along the river walls based on riparian/terrestrial gradients and stress tolerance, probably reflecting a gradient of wall height above river flows. Plant species richness was significantly higher on brick walls than that on sheet piling, indicating key differences between materials probably based on surface integrity. Large areas of connected river walls (wallscapes) through heavily engineered urban rivers represent potential sites for the enactment of reconciliation ecology via habitat improvement in urban ecosystems.

37,37,"Garcia, C",Jan 2018 ,"Seasonality, floods and droughts structure larval fish assemblages in prairie rivers",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,"Prairie stream fish assemblages experience seasonal shifts in habitat conditions, often coupled with powerful disturbance regimes, where systems fluctuate widely between drought and deluge. These abiotic drivers, more often than biotic factors, structure fish assemblages. Scouring floods may reset stream communities to early successional seres, and droughts may progressively eliminate species from communities. Therefore, fish assemblage structure resilience depends on recolonisation and reproductive success following a disturbance. Many plains fishes have life history traits that facilitate the wide dispersal and immediate contribution of offspring following disturbance events. However, descriptions of temporal and spatial patterns in larval assemblage structure in prairie streams are scarce, and few studies evaluate the effect of disturbances on reproduction. The objectives of this research were to (i) study the timing and contribution of native prairie stream fishes to drifting larval fish assemblages in three eastern South Dakota basins (Vermillion, James and Big Sioux) and (ii) describe larval fish responses to floods in the James River. We sampled drifting larval fish diversity during the spawning season from 2010 to 2012 throughout each basin. We also examined the effect of flooding on larval fish assemblage structure using data collected near the confluence of the James and Missouri rivers during baseflow (2003, 2004 and 2012) and flood conditions (2010). Subtle variability in spawning traits of prairie fishes and an apparent seasonal progression of larval fish taxa that secondarily respond to disturbance regimes suggests reproductive efforts are adapted to maximise the potential for successful recruitment in these severe systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000417191100034,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSeasonality%252C%2Bfloods%2Band%2Bdroughts%2Bstructure%2Blarval%2Bfish%2Bassemblages%2Bin%2Bprairie%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DCrystal%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DGarcia%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Feff.12354%26rft.eissn%3D1600-0633%26rft.epage%3D397%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0906-6691%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGY%2BOF%2BFRESHWATER%2BFISH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D389-397%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D389%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BFRESHW%2BFISH%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DGarcia%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DSchumann%252C%2BDA%26rft.au%3DKlumb%252C%2BRA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGY+OF+FRESHWATER+FISH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/eff.12354,"assemblage structure,drought,flood,larval fish,prairie streams,season","GREAT-PLAINS RIVER,NORTH-AMERICA,NOTROPIS-STRAMINEUS,BETA DIVERSITY,LIFE-HISTORY,SAND SHINER,STREAMS,IDENTIFICATION,DISTURBANCE,CONSERVATION",,"South Dakota State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Management, Brookings, SD 57007 USA"
38,38,"Yu, YQ",Mar 2015 ,Modeling subauroral polarization streams during the 17 March 2013 storm,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS,"The subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) are one of the most important features in representing magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art modeling framework that couples an inner magnetospheric ring current model RAM-SCB with a global MHD model Block-Adaptive Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and an ionospheric potential solver to study the SAPS that occurred during the 17 March 2013 storm event as well as to assess the modeling capability. Both ionospheric and magnetospheric signatures associated with SAPS are analyzed to understand the spatial and temporal evolution of the electrodynamics in the midlatitude regions. Results show that the model captures the SAPS at subauroral latitudes, where Region 2 field-aligned currents (FACs) flow down to the ionosphere and the conductance is lower than in the higher-latitude auroral zone. Comparisons to observations such as FACs observed by Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), cross-track ion drift from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), and in situ electric field observations from the Van Allen Probes indicate that the model generally reproduces the global dynamics of the Region2 FACs, the position of SAPS along the DMSP, and the location of the SAPS electric field around L of 3.0 in the inner magnetosphere near the equator. The model also demonstrates double westward flow channels in the dusk sector (the higher-latitude auroral convection and the subauroral SAPS) and captures the mechanism of the SAPS. However, the comparison with ion drifts along DMSP trajectories shows an underestimate of the magnitude of the SAPS and the sensitivity to the specific location and time. The comparison of the SAPS electric field with that measured from the Van Allen Probes shows that the simulated SAPS electric field penetrates deeper than in reality, implying that the shielding from the Region 2 FACs in the model is not well represented. Possible solutions in future studies to improve the modeling capability include implementing a self-consistent ionospheric conductivity module from inner magnetosphere particle precipitation, coupling with the thermosphere-ionosphere chemical processes, and connecting the ionosphere with the inner magnetosphere by the stronger Region 2 FACs calculated in the inner magnetosphere model.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000353237600018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bsubauroral%2Bpolarization%2Bstreams%2Bduring%2Bthe%2B17%2BMarch%2B2013%2Bstorm%26rft.aufirst%3DYiqun%26rft.auinit%3DYQ%26rft.aulast%3DYu%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014JA020371%26rft.eissn%3D2169-9402%26rft.epage%3D1750%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9380%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-SPACE%2BPHYSICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1738-1750%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1738%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-SPACE%26rft.volume%3D120%26rft.au%3DYu%252C%2BYQ%26rft.au%3DJordanova%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DWygant%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-SPACE+PHYSICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014JA020371,"subauroral polarization streams,ionosphere magnetosphere coupling,subauroral electrodynamics,inner magnetosphere","MAGNETOSPHERIC MODEL,ELECTRIC-FIELDS,PLASMA SHEET,LARGE-SCALE,CONVECTION,DEPENDENCE",,"Los Alamos Natl Lab, Appl Math & Plasma Phys, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA"
39,39,"Clyne, JB",Feb 2022 ,Groundwater-stream connectivity from minutes to months across United States basins as revealed by spectral analysis,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream corridors are dynamic places where streams and aquifers are connected and interact to various degrees, depending on geology, climate, stream morphology, and water use. Water table fluctuations propagate through the unconfined aquifer and are linked with changes in solute export to streams and biogeochemical transformations in floodplain soils. Through publicly available USGS data, this study aims to better understand the behaviour of stream-groundwater connectivity and water table fluctuations by analysing continuous time series of water levels from 17 pairs of stream gauges and nearby (<100 m) groundwater monitoring wells. Sites are located within 8 of 18 major hydrologic units (HUC-2) across the contiguous United States and span a variety of stream sizes, climates, and land use practises. More than 50% of sites have a water table that remains within 3 m of the land surface year-round. Energy spectral densities and cross-wavelet transformations generally reveal strong coherence between the water table and stream stage over daily to monthly periods. The transfer function, which describes relative variations between the water table and stream stage, shows that 10 of 17 sites are more stream-dominated at daily and monthly frequencies, meaning that water level fluctuations are greater in the stream and propagate into the aquifer. Only 1 of 17 sites is more groundwater-dominated at daily and monthly frequencies, meaning that water level fluctuations are greater in the aquifer. This study shows the utility of frequency-domain analysis for revealing specific timescales of stream-aquifer interaction.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000760417000029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14514%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater-stream%2Bconnectivity%2Bfrom%2Bminutes%2Bto%2Bmonths%2Bacross%2BUnited%2BStates%2Bbasins%2Bas%2Brevealed%2Bby%2Bspectral%2Banalysis%26rft.aufirst%3DJacob%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DJB%26rft.aulast%3DClyne%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14514%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DClyne%252C%2BJB%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14514,"hyporheic,riparian,signal processing,spectral analysis,surface water-groundwater interactions,water table","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,HYPORHEIC ZONE,WATER,AQUIFER,RIVER,FLOW,TERRESTRIAL,DIFFUSIVITY,TRANSPORT,RESPONSES",,"Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA"
40,40,"Bergstrom, A",Jun 2016 ,"Spatiotemporal processes that contribute to hydrologic exchange between hillslopes, valley bottoms, and streams",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Quantifying how watershed structure influences the exchanges of water among component parts of a watershed, particularly the connection between uplands, valley bottoms, and in-stream hydrologic exchange, remains a challenge. However, this understanding is critical for ascertaining the source areas and temporal contributions of water and associated biogeochemical constituents in streams. We used dilution gauging, mass recovery, and recording discharge stations to characterize streamflow dynamics across 52 reaches, from peak snowmelt to base flow, in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental forest, Montana, USA. We found that watershed-contributing area was only a significant predictor of net changes in streamflow at high moisture states and larger spatial scales. However, at the scale of individual stream reaches, the lateral contributing area in conjunction with underlying lithology and vegetation densities were significant predictors of gross hydrologic gains to the stream. Reach lateral contributing areas underlain by more permeable sandstone yielded less water across flow states relative to those with granite gneiss. Additionally, increases in the frequency of steps across each stream reach contributed to greater hydrologic gross losses. Together, gross gains and losses of water along individual reaches resulted in net changes of discharge that cumulatively scale to the observed outlet discharge dynamics. Our results provide a framework for understanding how hillslope topography, geology, vegetation, and valley bottom structure contribute to the exchange of water and cumulative increases of stream flow across watersheds of increasing size.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000380100200023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2Bprocesses%2Bthat%2Bcontribute%2Bto%2Bhydrologic%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Bhillslopes%252C%2Bvalley%2Bbottoms%252C%2Band%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAnna%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DBergstrom%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017972%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4645%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4628-4645%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4628%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DBergstrom%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DJencso%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DMcGlynn%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015WR017972,"hydrologic gross gain and loss,watershed scaling,mass recovery,channel morphology,lithology","RUNOFF GENERATION,WATER-BALANCE,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,SUBSURFACE STORMFLOW,SPATIAL VARIABILITY,CATCHMENT,SCALE,TRANSPORT,RAINFALL,BEDROCK",,"Univ Montana, Coll Forestry, Dept Forest Management, Missoula, MT 59812 USA"
41,41,"Vall-Casas, P",Feb 1 2021 ,Promoting citizen-based river groups at sub-basin scale for multi-level river governance in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region,LOCAL ENVIRONMENT,There is a gap between the increasing social use of urban rivers and limited citizen participation in river management under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). A pilot participatory process aimed at promoting the active involvement of the general public in the management of an urban stream in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region was designed and tested. The participatory process was supported by web-based Public Participation Geographic Information Systems and face-to-face workshops. The opinions of the general public were collected and citizen decision-making and self-organisation were promoted. Assessment of the pilot results provided key learning points supporting the creation of citizen-based river groups: (1) setting participation in the framework of a socio-ecological understanding of the river; (2) involving local volunteers in the leadership and dissemination of participatory processes; (3) supporting participants' learning and networking; and (4) connecting municipal-scale and basin-scale environmental interests and institutions through intermediate citizen platforms at sub-basin scale. These learning points offer a baseline for building a theory on the design of bottom-up participatory processes aimed at empowering riparian communities.

For high values of the Peclet number Pe, a boundary layer arises near the wall separating the streams. Matched asymptotic expansions (MAE) are used to obtain approximate solutions. We consider arbitrary inlet temperatures and derive higher-order corrections of the boundary problem. The separating wall is supposed to be sufficiently thin to neglect the heat conduction in it. Analyticity and adiabatic conditions at the outer walls impose restrictions on the inlet temperatures. It turns out, however, that only the inlet temperatures at the wall separating the two fluids enter the leading-order problem. The Nusselt numbers thus calculated are in the leading order proportional to (Pe/x)(1/3), where x is the stream-wise coordinate. An estimate of the thickness of the separating wall to validate the MAE approach is obtained. It is also demonstrated that the MAE analysis is unable to describe the heat exchange of counterflowing fluids.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000090153800006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHigh%2BPeclet%2Bnumber%2Bheat%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Bcocurrent%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DP%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DPlaschko%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs004190000085%26rft.epage%3D611%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0939-1533%26rft.issue%3D8-9%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIVE%2BOF%2BAPPLIED%2BMECHANICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D597-611%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D597%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BAPPL%2BMECH%26rft.volume%3D70&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=ARCHIVE+OF+APPLIED+MECHANICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s004190000085,"heat conduction,laminar boundary layer,asymptotic expansion",,,"Univ Autonoma Metropolitana, Dept Fis, Unidad Iztapalapa, Mexico City 09430, DF, Mexico"

Results show that (1) the multidimensional ur-banization was high in the east and low in the west, while the resource-environment performance showed a trend in which the high-level area is decreasing and the low-level area is moving to the east. (2) In terms of the temporal sequence evolution, the multidimensional urbanization lagging cities in the study area dominated, but the number of resource-environment performance lagging cities represented by Shanghai, gradually expanded. (3) The range of the center of gravity in the multidimensional urbanization and resource-environment perfor-mance coupling degree in terms of longitude and latitude was 119.675 degrees E-119.708 degrees E and 30.983 degrees N-31.008 degrees N, respectively. Generally, the center of gravity shifts to the northwest, but the total migration distance was only 5.489 km. (4) The obstacles restricting improvement of the multidimensional urbanization and resource--environment performance coupling coordination degree mainly come from the population factor, while tech-nological, ecological, spatial, and economic factors all play positive roles. Among them, the technical factor has the greatest impact, where the coupling coordination degree increases by 0.5198% for every 1% increase.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000922090100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B103360%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2Bcoupling%2Bof%2Bmultidimensional%2Burbanization%2Band%2Bresource-environment%2Bperformance%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BDelta%2Burban%2Bagglomeration%2Bof%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DHan%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DHu%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.pce.2023.103360%26rft.eissn%3D1873-5193%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1474-7065%26rft.jtitle%3DPHYSICS%2BAND%2BCHEMISTRY%2BOF%2BTHE%2BEARTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DPHYS%2BCHEM%2BEARTH%26rft.volume%3D129%26rft.au%3DHu%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DLv%252C%2BTG%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=PHYSICS+AND+CHEMISTRY+OF+THE+EARTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.pce.2023.103360,"Multidimensional urbanization,Resource-environment performance,Coupling coordination degree model,Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration","CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS,ECO-ENVIRONMENT,SPATIAL DIFFERENTIATION,CO2 EMISSIONS,COORDINATION,EFFICIENCY,GRAVITY",,"Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Tourism & Urban Management, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China"
44,44,"Iqbal, R",Sep 2009 ,DAg-stream: Distributed video adaptation for overlay streaming to heterogeneous devices,PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS,"Combining the advantages of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content distribution concept and metadata driven adaptation of videos in compressed domain, in this paper, we propose a simple but scalable design of distributed adaptation and overlay streaming using MPEG-21 gBSD, called DAg-stream. The objective is not only to shift the bandwidth burden to end participating peers, but also to move the computation load for adapting video contents away from dedicated media-streaming/adaptation servers. It is an initiative to merge the adaptation operations and the P2P streaming basics to support the expansion of context-aware mobile P2P systems. DAg-stream organizes mobile and heterogeneous peers into overlays. For each video, a separate overlay is formed. No control message is exchanged among peers for overlay maintenance. We present a combination of infrastructure-centric and application end-point architecture. The infrastructure-centric architecture refers to a tree controller, named DAg-master, which is responsible for tree/overlay administering and maintenance. The application end-point architecture refers to video sharing, streaming and adaptation by the participating resourceful peers. The motivation for this work is based on the experiences and lessons learned so far about developing a video adaptation system for heterogeneous devices. In this article, we present our architecture and some experimental evaluations supporting the design concept for overlay video streaming and online adaptation.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000284091500003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDAg-stream%253A%2BDistributed%2Bvideo%2Badaptation%2Bfor%2Boverlay%2Bstreaming%2Bto%2Bheterogeneous%2Bdevices%26rft.aufirst%3DRazib%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DIqbal%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12083-009-0031-0%26rft.eissn%3D1936-6450%26rft.epage%3D216%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1936-6442%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DPEER-TO-PEER%2BNETWORKING%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D202-216%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D202%26rft.stitle%3DPEER%2BPEER%2BNETW%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D2%26rft.au%3DIqbal%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DShirmohammadi%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=PEER-TO-PEER+NETWORKING+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12083-009-0031-0,"H.264,MPEG-21 gBSD,Overlay streaming,Video adaptation",MULTICAST,,"Univ Ottawa, SITE, 800 King Edward Ave, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada"

In response, we conducted an identical series of instantaneous nutrient addition experiments, using ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and phosphate phosphorus (PO4-P) alone or together, in two mesotrophic agricultural headwater streams in Chaohu Lake Basin, China, to quantify the relationships between nutrient concentrations and uptake rates, and examine how NH4-N and PO4-P interact to affect their individual uptake. Both the Michaelis-Menten (M-M) equation and response surface model were utilized to analyze coupled NH4-N and PO4-P uptake patterns across a range of nutrient concentrations, by fitting the kinetic processes of NH4-N and PO4-P uptake in single- and dual-nutrient additions. The capacity of both NH4-N and PO4-P uptake was increased in different degrees in dual-nutrient additions. Response surface models could quantitatively characterize the three-dimensional dynamic evolution trend of NH4-N or PO4-P uptake rates at different concentrations. The influence of PO4-P additions on NH4-N uptake was generally greater than that of NH4-N on PO4-P uptake in the five tracer tests. In addition, results of correlation analysis indicated that water temperature might be the main factor affecting the coupling of N and P uptake in mesotrophic streams and followed by hydrological factors (e.g., discharge) and channel geomorphology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000669305500014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAssessing%2Bthe%2Bpotential%2Band%2Bkinetics%2Bof%2Bcoupled%2Bnutrients%2Buptake%2Bin%2Bmesotrophic%2Bstreams%2Bin%2BChaohu%2BLake%2BBasin%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DRuzhong%26rft.auinit%3DRZ%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-021-15214-5%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D62890%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D44%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D62877-62890%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D62877%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BRZ%26rft.au%3DFu%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BGQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11356-021-15214-5,"Mesotrophic streams,Nutrient uptake,Synergistic effects,Nutrient spiraling metrics,TASCC (tracer additions for spiraling curve characterization) method","CO-LIMITATION,P UPTAKE,NITROGEN,PHOSPHORUS,SATURATION,STOICHIOMETRY,RESTORATION,ADDITIONS,GRADIENT,AMBIENT",,"Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China"

We hypothesize that significant transverse cross-sectional DO variation is observable within a river. Such variation may influence conventional single-station metabolic rate (primary production and respiration) estimates with respect to DO probe location, and reveal important connections between physical and biogeochemical processes and their drivers in rivers. Using a mobile sensor system, we measured river properties across a bend in the lower Merced River in Central California under stationary flow conditions in April and September. Cross-sectional temperature, DO, and chlorophyll-a concentrations exhibited modest but significant gradients, which varied in magnitude and direction on a diel basis. The spatiotemporal variation was consistent with reach geomorphology and incident light patterns. Gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR24), and net ecosystem production (NEP) rates estimates derived from local DO and temperature time series varied by 3-10% over the river cross section, with greater variation in late summer. The presence of transverse metabolic rate gradients in this relatively simple reach implies the existence of substantial gradients in more complex river regimes, such as those spanning distinctively different microhabitats, transient storage zones, and related distributed biogeochemical zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000331798800033,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTransverse%2Bspatiotemporal%2Bvariability%2Bof%2Blowland%2Briver%2Bproperties%2Band%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bmetabolic%2Brate%2Bestimates%26rft.aufirst%3DSandra%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DSR%26rft.aulast%3DVillamizar%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR014245%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D493%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D482-493%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D482%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DVillamizar%252C%2BSR%26rft.au%3DPai%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DHarmon%252C%2BTC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR014245,"transverse variability,subreach scale,whole-stream metabolism,lowland rivers","ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,TEMPORAL VARIATION,STREAM METABOLISM,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN,RESIDENCE TIME,LAND-USE,REAERATION,MODEL,PHOTOSYNTHESIS,PHYTOPLANKTON",,"Univ Calif, Sch Engn, 5200 North Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA"

A better understanding of the relationship between urbanization and natural disasters would support for the sustainable city development. However, the coupling relationship between urbanization and natural disasters is still unclear and it is insufficient in quantitative characterization. Taking the Pearl River Delta as a case study, we presented an index system for urbanization and natural disasters and established a coupling coordination model to explore the coupling relationship between them. The urbanization level was evaluated from four dimensions: population, space, society, and economy. The disaster-causing factor, disaster prevention and mitigation, and disaster loss were used to describe the disaster system. The coupling coordination model indicated that the development of urbanization to a certain level was beneficial for reducing disaster loss. The coupling degree between urbanization and the disaster system increased, which in the central cities was significantly higher than that in the eastern and western cities. Cities with high urbanization levels had higher coupling degrees, indicating that a high level of urbanization helped prevent natural disasters. Therefore, understanding the coupling relationship between them and its development can guide the promotion of the coordinated relationship between urbanization development and disaster prevention.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000632503900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B102057%26rft.atitle%3DExamining%2Bthe%2Bcoupling%2Brelationship%2Bbetween%2Burbanization%2Band%2Bnatural%2Bdisasters%253A%2BA%2Bcase%2Bstudy%2Bof%2Bthe%2BPearl%2BRiver%2BDelta%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DHongwei%26rft.auinit%3DHW%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ijdrr.2021.102057%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2212-4209%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BDISASTER%2BRISK%2BREDUCTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BDISAST%2BRISK%2BRE%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BHW%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BEQ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BHQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FDY1JUa0FkjNNwdxj6CM&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+DISASTER+RISK+REDUCTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102057,"Urbanization,Natural disasters,Coupling coordination degree model,Information entropy weight,Disaster prevention and mitigation,The Pearl River Delta","ECO-ENVIRONMENT,RISK-ASSESSMENT,FLOOD RISK,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY,GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS,ADAPTIVE CAPACITY,SAO-PAULO,MODEL,COORDINATION,PREVENTION",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China"

From the global mass conservation, an analytical solution has been obtained for the cross-sectional and cycle averaged axial velocity. It is shown that this averaged velocity is non-vanishing due to the mass streaming effect. By analyzing the global momentum balance, it is found that the cycle-averaged pressure depends on the momentum streaming and friction force, and a conservation relationship exists between the momentum streaming and the cycle-averaged pressure for the flow oscillating at a high frequency in a wide tube. An investigation of the global energy balance leads to an expression for thermoacoustic energy streaming. Furthermore, it is shown that the refrigeration effect is mainly caused by the non-vanishing mean velocity, and therefore the mass streaming and the energy streaming are intimately connected.

49,49,"Almonte, F",Dec 1 2005 ,Integration and segregation in auditory streaming,PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA,"We aim to capture the perceptual dynamics of auditory streaming using a neurally inspired model of auditory processing. Traditional approaches view streaming as a competition of streams, realized within a tonotopically organized neural network. In contrast, we view streaming to be a dynamic integration process which resides at locations other than the sensory specific neural subsystems. This process finds its realization in the synchronization of neural ensembles or in the existence of informational convergence zones. Our approach uses two interacting dynamical systems, in which the first system responds to incoming acoustic stimuli and transforms them into a spatiotemporal neural field dynamics. The second system is a classification system coupled to the neural field and evolves to a stationary state. These states are identified with a single perceptual stream or multiple streams. Several results in human perception are modelled including temporal coherence and fission boundaries [L.P.A.S. van Noorden, Temporal coherence in the perception of tone sequences, Ph.D. Thesis, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, 1975], and crossing of motions [A.S. Bregman, Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound, MIT Press, 1990]. Our model predicts phenomena such as the existence of two streams with the same pitch, which cannot be explained by the traditional stream competition models. An experimental study is performed to provide proof of existence of this phenomenon. The model elucidates possible mechanisms that may underlie perceptual phenomena. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
