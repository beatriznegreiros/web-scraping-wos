0,0,"Bao, J",Feb 2022 ,Modeling framework for evaluating the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on hydrologic exchange fluxes and residence time for a large-scale river section over a long-term period,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"Quantifying hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEF) at the river and subsurface interface and their residence times (RT) in subsurface are important for managing the water quality and ecosystem health in dynamic river corridor systems. In this study, a modeling framework is developed for coupling the three-dimensional (3D) multi-phase surface, subsurface flow transport, and numerical tracer model for RT in a large-scale river section over a long period. The framework is utilized to evaluate the impacts of hydrodynamic pressure on HEFs and RT for a 30 km section of the Columbia River in Washington State over a three-year period. Based on comparisons between model simulations with and without considering hydrodynamic pressure, we found that hydrodynamic pressure increases the net HEFs by 7% with river gaining water from the subsurface domain, and leads to slight reduction of RT.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000787892500005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B105277%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bframework%2Bfor%2Bevaluating%2Bthe%2Bimpacts%2Bof%2Bhydrodynamic%2Bpressure%2Bon%2Bhydrologic%2Bexchange%2Bfluxes%2Band%2Bresidence%2Btime%2Bfor%2Ba%2Blarge-scale%2Briver%2Bsection%2Bover%2Ba%2Blong-term%2Bperiod%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DBao%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.envsoft.2021.105277%26rft.eissn%3D1873-6726%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1364-8152%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMODELLING%2B%2526%2BSOFTWARE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMODELL%2BSOFTW%26rft.volume%3D148%26rft.au%3DBao%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BYX%26rft.au%3DScheibe%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MODELLING+%26+SOFTWARE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105277,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD),River flow model,Subsurface-flow model,Subsurface residence time distribution (RTD)","MISSISSIPPI RIVER,FLOW,DYNAMICS,DENITRIFICATION,GROUNDWATER,SIMULATION,NETWORK,SCIENCE",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA"
1,1,"Chen, ML",Nov 28 2016 ,Lead isotope exchange between dissolved and fluvial particulate matter: a laboratory study from the Johor River estuary,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES,"Atmospheric aerosols are the dominant source of Pb to the modern marine environment, and as a result, in most regions of the ocean the Pb isotopic composition of dissolved Pb in the surface ocean (and in corals) matches that of the regional aerosols. In the Singapore Strait, however, there is a large offset between seawater dissolved and coral Pb isotopes and that of the regional aerosols. We propose that this difference results from isotope exchange between dissolved Pb supplied by anthropogenic aerosol deposition and adsorbed natural crustal Pb on weathered particles delivered to the ocean by coastal rivers. To investigate this issue, Pb isotope exchange was assessed through a closed-system exchange experiment using estuarine waters collected at the Johor River mouth (which discharges to the Singapore Strait). During the experiment, a known amount of dissolved Pb with the isotopic composition of NBS-981 (Pb-206/Pb-207=1.093) was spiked into the unfiltered Johor water (dissolved and particulate Pb-206/Pb-207=1.199) and the changing isotopic composition of the dissolved Pb was monitored. The mixing ratio of the estuarine and spike Pb should have produced a dissolved Pb-206/Pb-207 isotopic composition of 1.161, but within a week, the Pb-206/Pb-207 in the water increased to 1.190 and continued to increase to 1.197 during the next two months without significant changes of the dissolved Pb concentration. The kinetics of isotope exchange was assessed using a simple K-d model, which assumes multiple sub-reservoirs within the particulate matter with different exchange rate constants. The K-d model reproduced 56% of the observed Pb isotope variance. Both the closedsystem experiment and field measurements imply that isotope exchange can be an important mechanism for controlling Pb and Pb isotopes in coastal waters. A similar process may occur for other trace elements.

2,2,"Ding, MT",Feb 2014 ,Coupling mechanism of rural settlements and mountain disasters in the upper reaches of Min River,JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE,"Human settlements are the place where human beings live, among which the rural settlements can be regarded as a reflection of human-land relationship in mountain areas because their vertical distribution is greatly influenced by the specific geographical environment and ecological conditions of mountains. Based on field investigation, this paper uses physical, geographical, and ecological theories to make a comprehensive study of rural settlements and mountain disasters in the upper Min River, which is an ecologically fragile area with high-frequency disasters (collapse, landslide, debris flow, etc.) and a minority inhabit district. By applying these modern scientific theories, this paper attempts to shed some light on the relationship between rural settlements and mountain disasters. Consequently, an in-depth understanding of this relationship was achieved as follows: (1) Rural settlements and mountain disasters are mainly distributed in the intercepted flows of water and soil; and both quantity and quality of arable lands in mountains are important indicators of these flows. (2) The Small Watershed Management Project is a complex system of rural settlements and mountain disasters that interacts with and constrains the ecological system. By this project, the human survival will be better guaranteed. Being fundamental for the ecological reconstruction, the coupling mechanism of rural settlements and mountain disasters is not only an engine to promote harmonious development between human and nature, but also a bridge to link them.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000330783100006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bmechanism%2Bof%2Brural%2Bsettlements%2Band%2Bmountain%2Bdisasters%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bupper%2Breaches%2Bof%2BMin%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3Dmingtao%26rft.auinit%3DMT%26rft.aulast%3DDing%2BMing-tao%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11629-012-2366-x%26rft.eissn%3D1993-0321%26rft.epage%3D72%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1672-6316%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMOUNTAIN%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D66-72%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D66%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BMT%2BSCI-ENGL%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DDing%252C%2BMT%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BZL%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+MOUNTAIN+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11629-012-2366-x,"The upper reaches of Min River,Mountain disaster,Rural settlement,Coupling mechanism,Remote sensing",,,"Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Resources, Mianyang 621010, Peoples R China"

4,4,"Fu, Z",Jan 2016 ,Qualitative and Quantitative Evaluation of Coupling Approaches for Coupling of RELAP5 and LabVIEW,NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,"In the study and design of a nuclear power plant, extensive system modeling is necessary to determine how the reactor will perform in any given situation, not only in the normal performance of the reactor, but also in transients including unanticipated transients without scram and hypothetical accidents. One type of nuclear power plant under study is the hybrid energy system, which uses nuclear power to generate both electricity and heat for facilities. Obviously, the second steam cycle in the nuclear power plant requires several design updates and experiments. Unfortunately, the current versions of the Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program (RELAP) do not allow online data streams from experimental facilities to the computational model of the secondary steam loop. Therefore, this study develops a coupling between RELAP5 and Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (Lab VIEW) to model primary and secondary coolant loops. In this way, the LabVIEW model can easily be connected to an experimental apparatus to provide an online data stream and the online transient behavior of an entire nuclear power plant system. This study shows two different coupling approaches and makes qualitative and quantitative comparisons between these approaches.This paper demonstrates the results of different couplings between the primary and secondary systems of a typical pressurized water reactor (PWR). The primary loop model is a four-loop PWR. The model has been executed with steady state and transients (in this case, a loss-of-coolant accident). The results of both coupling methods have been compared with the typical RELAP5 results.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000368571400010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQualitative%2Band%2BQuantitative%2BEvaluation%2Bof%2BCoupling%2BApproaches%2Bfor%2BCoupling%2Bof%2BRELAP5%2Band%2BLabVIEW%26rft.aufirst%3DZheng%26rft.auinit%3DZ%26rft.aulast%3DFu%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.13182%252FNSE15-4%26rft.eissn%3D1943-748X%26rft.epage%3D134%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-5639%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DNUCLEAR%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D119-134%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D119%26rft.stitle%3DNUCL%2BSCI%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D182%26rft.au%3DFu%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DPack%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DAydogan%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=NUCLEAR+SCIENCE+AND+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.13182/NSE15-4,"LabVIEW,RELAP5,coupling",,,"Univ Idaho, Ctr Adv Energy Studies, 995 Univ Blvd, Idaho Falls, ID 83401 USA"
5,5,"Romani, AM",Nov 2013 ,Microbial biofilm structure and organic matter use in mediterranean streams,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"River and stream biofilms in mediterranean fluvial ecosystems face both extreme seasonality as well as arrhythmic fluctuations. The hydrological extremes (droughts and floods) impose direct changes in water availability but also in the quantity and quality of organic matter and nutrients that sustain the microbial growth. This review analyzes how these ecological pulses might determine unique properties of biofilms developing in mediterranean streams. The paper brings together data from heterotrophic and autotrophic community structure, and extracellular enzyme activities in biofilms in mediterranean streams. Mediterranean stream biofilms show higher use of peptides during the favorable period for epilithic algae development (spring), and preferential use of cellulose and hemicellulose in autumn as a response to allochthonous input. The drying process causes the reduction in bacterial production and chlorophyll biomass, but the rapid recovery of both autotrophs and heterotrophs with rewetting indicates their adaptability to fluctuations. Bacteria surviving the drought are mainly associated with sediment and leaf litter which serve as ""humid refuges"". Some algae and cyanobacteria show resistant strategies to cope with the drought stress. The resistance to these fluctuations is strongly linked to the streambed characteristics (e.g., sediment grain size, organic matter accumulation, nutrient content).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000325182400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMicrobial%2Bbiofilm%2Bstructure%2Band%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Buse%2Bin%2Bmediterranean%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAnna%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DRomani%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-012-1302-y%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D58%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D43-58%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D43%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D719%26rft.au%3DRomani%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DAmalfitano%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DZoppini%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-012-1302-y,"Biofilm,Extracellular enzymes,Drought resistance,Bacteria,Algae,Mediterranean river","EXTRACELLULAR ENZYME-ACTIVITY,IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION,BACTERIAL COMMUNITY,ALGAL RECOLONIZATION,SEASONAL-VARIATIONS,WATER,DROUGHT,RIVER,RESPONSES,BIOMASS",,"Univ Girona, Inst Aquat Ecol, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain"
6,6,"Xia, JQ",2019 ,One-dimensional coupled modeling of bed evolution and bank erosion processes in the Middle Yangtze River,CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE,"After the operation of the Three Gorges Project, the Middle Yangtze River has continuously suffered from channel degradation, along with significant bank erosion processes in local subreaches, especially in the Jingjiang Reach, which may cause serious problems to channel stability, flood control management and navigation safety. In this study, a one-dimensional coupled morphodynamic model for bed evolution and bank erosion processes was proposed, including three modules for hydro- and sediment dynamics, groundwater flow and bank erosion, with the mode of plannar failure in the Upper Jingjiang Reach (UJR) and the mode of cantilever failure in the Lower Jingjiang reach (LJR) being considered. The proposed model was applied respectively to simulate the fluvial processes in the Jingjiang Reach in 2005, 2007 and 2010, in order to conduct a detailed process of model calibration and validation. These calculated results show that: (1) The proposed model accurately reproduced the flow and sediment transport processes, with the root mean squared errors of daily averaged discharge and suspended sediment concentration far less than the corresponding mean values. Besides, the model also predicted the major occurrence regions of serious bank erosion processes; (2) bank failure was mainly controlled by fluvial erosion in the Jingjiang Reach, with more than 50% of cantilever failure events in the LJR occurring during the flood period; and (3) the groundwater level variation was delayed, as compared with the river stage change, which could also obviously influence bank erosion processes in the UJR. Furthermore, multiple test runs were conducted to investigate the influences of the variations in outlet river stage and bank soil properties on the processes of bank erosion. These results from test runs indicate that: (1) If the outlet river stage was increased due to a higher lateral inflow from the Dongting Lake, the bank retreat width in the Jingjiang Reach would be decreased, resulting from the reduced longitudinal water surface slope and mean velocity in section; (2) the calculated bank retreat width at a section was most sensitive to an reduction in critical shear stress of bank soil, especially in the LJR. However, the calculated bank retreat width in the UJR was also sentitive to the change in bank soil cohesion, but it did not monototically decrease with an increase in soil cohesion. This is because the varitation in soil cohesion can lead to changes in the number, timing and individual failed block volumes of bank failure events. As the failure number keeps unchanged, an increase in soil cohesion would lead to a delayed occurrence of bank failure event and thus a larger failed block volume, which finally results in a larger total retreat width.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000496444000009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOne-dimensional%2Bcoupled%2Bmodeling%2Bof%2Bbed%2Bevolution%2Band%2Bbank%2Berosion%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMiddle%2BYangtze%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DJunqiang%26rft.auinit%3DJQ%26rft.aulast%3DXia%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1360%252FN972018-01147%26rft.eissn%3D2095-9419%26rft.epage%3D740%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0023-074X%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DCHINESE%2BSCIENCE%2BBULLETIN-CHINESE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D725-740%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D725%26rft.stitle%3DCHIN%2BSCI%2BB-CHIN%26rft.volume%3D64%26rft.au%3DXia%252C%2BJQ%26rft.au%3DDeng%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DLin%252C%2BFF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=CHINESE+SCIENCE+BULLETIN-CHINESE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1360/N972018-01147,"bed evolution,bank erosion,variation in groundwater level,coupled morphodynamic model,Jingjiang Reach,Middle Yangtze River","NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,JINGJIANG REACH,STABILITY",,"Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China"

Understanding factors determining zooplankton abundance, composition, and dispersal provides information needed for improving plankton dynamic predictions and enhancing effective water resource management and biodiversity conservation. We studied zooplankton dispersal and identified factors influence zooplankton composition and abundance under a unique in situ environment with four connected water types from the natural river to a man-made main canal, then interior canal-web, and finally lake that have different flow regimes. We found that, after seven years creation of the water system and zooplankton community development, the main canal, interior canal-web, and lake had 53%-64% zooplankton taxa similar to their water origin river but that each water type was represented and dominated by different zooplankton taxa. Our optimal model identified three key local factors that affected the difference in zooplankton abundance and composition among the four water types: Chlorophyll a concentration, turbidity, and salinity. We concluded that both zooplankton dispersal through watercourse and species sorting by local factors were important for structuring communities in our study system. Since most studies on dispersal and influence of local factors on zooplankton assemblages in new environment have been done largely in temporal ponds, our findings provide unique insights on how zooplankton communities are jointly regulated by their species dispersal origins and local environmental factors in newly created canals and lakes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000425828200050,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFactors%2Bdetermining%2Bzooplankton%2Bassemblage%2Bdifference%2Bamong%2Ba%2Bman-made%2Blake%252C%2Bconnecting%2Bcanals%252C%2Band%2Bthe%2Bwater-origin%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DKun%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DZhao%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecolind.2017.07.052%26rft.eissn%3D1872-7034%26rft.epage%3D496%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1470-160X%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BINDICATORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D488-496%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D488%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BINDIC%26rft.volume%3D84%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BLZ%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BQX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+INDICATORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.052,"Zooplankton assemblage,Man-made lake,Connecting canal,Dispersal,Influential factor","FILTER-FEEDING FISH,METACOMMUNITY STRUCTURE,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT,PLANKTIVOROUS FISH,TEMPERATE ZONE,SHALLOW LAKE,BODY-SIZE,BOTTOM-UP,FOOD WEBS",,"Shanghai Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, 100 Guilin Rd, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China"

Coupling the model with a nutrient transport model clarified the longitudinal distribution of both periphyton community and nutrients. The thickness of the periphyton mat, an important factor regulating nutrient exchange between the mat and overflowing water, was determined from water velocity and the periphyton biomass. We compared die results of this study with three observational data sets to overall validate our proposal. (1) a comparison of electrical conductance in two channels with different periphyton biomasses validated the model in the mass exchange between stationary and flowing water zones; (2) a comparison of the temporal variation in periphyton biomass and nutrient concentration in a once-through and a re-circulated water channel, validated the relationships among the periphyton biomass, the nutrient uptake rate, and the nutrient concentrations in the stationary water zone; and (3) a longitudinal distribution of the algal species composition of Stigeoclanium and Chamaesiphon, and the nutrient concentrations of a 140 m reach was reproduced and compared with measured data.

Pool-specific fin-clipping was used to mark fish collected by electrofishing at monthly intervals (March to November 1995). Of the 367 fish marked, 85 were recaptured, giving a return of 23.16 %. Pike and rudd tended to remain in their home pool, with rudd showing higher activity within the backwater than pike. Roach and perch were not resident in the backwater. The ratio between two population estimates, the Schnabel and Seber gr LeCren estimates, was used to calculate an exchange rate of fish movement between the river and the backwater. Immigration and emigration was greater in roach and perch, having an average exchange rate of 90-96 % per month and a low number of recaptures.

10,10,"Zhang, Y",Jun 2022 ,"Coupling Coordination Development of New-Type Urbanization and Cultivated Land Low-Carbon Utilization in the Yangtze River Delta, China",LAND,"Although urbanization greatly benefits economy-society development in China, it poses enormous challenges to cultivated land utilization. In the context of urbanization acceleration and carbon neutrality, it's of significance to achieve high-quality economy-society development and sustainable agricultural development. Thus, the coupling coordination relationship between new-type urbanization and cultivated land low-carbon utilization (CLLCU) needs to be examined. However, this topic has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. To fill the gap, this paper adopted a comprehensive evaluation model and a super-efficiency SBM (Slacked Based Measure) model to evaluate the level of new-type urbanization and the cultivated land low-carbon utilization efficiency (CLLCUE) of cities in the Yangtze River Delta in China from 2000 to 2018. Furthermore, the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM) and the relative development degree model (RDDM) were employed to measure the coupling coordination degree and the relative state of the new-type urbanization and CLLCU The results show that the coupling coordination degree between the new-type urbanization level and CLLCUE experienced a process of ""rapid increase-steady develop"" and presented a spatial pattern of ""polarization-regional equilibrium"". In addition, the relative state of the new-type urbanization and CLLCU presented the ""reversal"" phenomenon. In other words, the relative state changed from the new-type urbanization lagging behind CLLCU to the new-type urbanization ahead of CLLCU. None of the cities were in the state of simultaneous development. Finally, this paper puts forward policy recommendations to explore differentiated CLLCU modes and improve the quality and efficiency of new-type urbanization.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000818281700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B919%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BCoordination%2BDevelopment%2Bof%2BNew-Type%2BUrbanization%2Band%2BCultivated%2BLand%2BLow-Carbon%2BUtilization%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BDelta%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DYue%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fland11060919%26rft.eissn%3D2073-445X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DLAND%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DLAND-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DDai%252C%2BYQ%26rft.au%3DKe%252C%2BXL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=LAND&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/land11060919,"the Yangtze River Delta,new-type urbanization,cultivated land low-carbon utilization,coupling coordination","USE EFFICIENCY,RAPID URBANIZATION,YIELD",,"Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China"

Recent research has shown that caddisfly silk binds stream sediments and alters streambed cohesion, yet potential influences of caddisfly activity on streambed hydrologic properties have not received similar scrutiny. Utilizing a novel downward flow permeameter, we demonstrate how net-spinning caddisfly colonization of the streambed interstitia at moderate but common densities (2000 m(-2)) can reduce vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-V) by up to 55% in streambed sediments (coarse sand-medium gravel; median diameter = 12.91 mm). Additionally, organic matter content within sediment columns showed that occupation by caddisflies resulted in twice the ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of noncaddisfly (primarily microbial) organic matter at the end of our experiments relative to control systems that lack caddisflies. These results suggest that net-spinning caddisflies may restrict hyporheic exchange, alter streambed hydrologic residence time distributions and increase per-unit-volume biotic metabolic demand for stream solutes in the hyporheic zone, with the potential to alter whole-stream biogeochemical processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000599106800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2266%26rft.atitle%3DEcosystem%2Bengineering%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bstreambed%253A%2BNet-spinning%2Bcaddisflies%2Binfluence%2Bhydraulic%2Bproperties%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DMacDonald%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Feco.2266%26rft.eissn%3D1936-0592%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1936-0584%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DECOHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOHYDROLOGY%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DMacDonald%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DAlbertson%252C%2BLK%26rft.au%3DPoole%252C%2BGC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=ECOHYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/eco.2266,"biofilm,ecotone,hydraulic conductivity,Hydropsychidae,hyporheic,net‐,spinning caddisfly,permeameter","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,FRESH-WATER,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES,SURFACE,DYNAMICS,ECOLOGY,HABITAT,FLOW,CONDUCTIVITY",,"Montana State Univ, Coll Letters & Sci, Dept Ecol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA"

We modified the propane injection method to measure gas exchange coefficients and evaluated its application for small streams. The tracer solution was prepared by solubilizing propane directly in a conservative solute solution, and it was injected as a constant-rate injection, a single slug, or an extended slug. Water samples were taken at four to five sampling stations along the study reach at the tracer concentration peak, and propane and conductivity were measured. The propane exchange rate (k (propane)) was calculated using the regression method with the propane/conductivity ratio against solute travel time (in hours). The mixed tracer injection method was conducted in four streams, and all k (propane) measurements (n = 8) were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The short-duration constant rate injection and extended slug injection provided k (propane) estimates with higher r (2) than the single slug injection. The k (20) measured with propane injection ranged from 5.4 to 40.0 day(-1), and they were significantly correlated with empirically estimated k. The mixed tracer injection method with propane could potentially reduce field time, crew demands, and field equipment; thus, it would potentially lower the overall cost of gas exchange coefficient measurements and be an effective method in small, remote streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000308875600054,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMixed%2BTracer%2BInjection%2BMethod%2Bto%2BMeasure%2BReaeration%2BCoefficients%2Bin%2BSmall%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DHwa-Seong%26rft.auinit%3DHS%26rft.aulast%3DJin%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11270-012-1280-8%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2932%26rft.epage%3D5306%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0049-6979%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BAND%2BSOIL%2BPOLLUTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5297-5306%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5297%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BSOIL%2BPOLL%26rft.volume%3D223%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BHS%26rft.au%3DWhite%252C%2BDS%26rft.au%3DKipphut%252C%2BGW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=WATER+AIR+AND+SOIL+POLLUTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11270-012-1280-8,"Reaeration coefficient,Stream,Metabolism,Propane,Oxygen","GAS-EXCHANGE,LAND-USE,CARBON-DIOXIDE,METABOLISM,RESPIRATION,CAPACITY,RATES",,"Univ Louisville, Dept Biol, Louisville, KY 40292 USA"
14,14,"Singer, G",2011 ,Monomeric carbohydrate uptake and structure-function coupling in stream biofilms,AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"We investigated the uptake of monomeric carbohydrates in stream biofilms under various hydrodynamic environments. Flow velocity and biofilm structure influenced the uptake of glucose (Glc) and arabinose (Ara), 2 carbohydrate monomers differing in bioavailability. While the uptake of Glc increased with flow velocity, the uptake of Ara showed a weaker and inverse relationship with flow velocity. Microautoradiography and confocal-laser-scanning-microscopy of biofilm cryosections revealed patterns of monomer uptake over biofilm depth. Glc was preferentially taken up in the biofilm canopy, and modelled depth gradients suggested that boundary layer thickness controls external Glc mass transfer to the biofilm. In contrast, Ara uptake was uniformly distributed or concentrated in deeper biofilm layers. Overall, Glc uptake was negatively correlated with Ara uptake. We suggest that the spatial separation of monomer uptake involves unidirectional supply flux to biofilms and selective use of carbon sources of differing quality.

The temperatures of the ambient air, stream water, streambed (depth = 10 cm), and adjacent stream sediment (depth = 10 cm) showed distinctive diurnal variations with long-term seasonal cooling trends, while groundwater temperature showed only a seasonal decreasing trend with little diurnal variations. Auto-correlations and spectral densities of the stream water, streambed, and sediment temperatures also revealed strong daily cyclical behaviors, with longer periodic cycles varying from weekly to monthly. Amplitudes and lag times of the streambed thermal signals were also affected by the hydraulic conductivities of the sediments. Lower hydraulic conductivity indicates a more attenuated and slower thermal response for the streambed. The calculated vertical water flow velocities of the streambed revealed that the investigated stream locations were under losing or gaining conditions, depending on the location and time.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000330518400014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStream%2BWater%2Band%2BGroundwater%2BInteraction%2BRevealed%2Bby%2BTemperature%2BMonitoring%2Bin%2BAgricultural%2BAreas%26rft.aufirst%3DJin-Yong%26rft.auinit%3DJY%26rft.aulast%3DLee%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw5041677%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.epage%3D1698%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1677-1698%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1677%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D5%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BJY%26rft.au%3DLim%252C%2BHS%26rft.au%3DPark%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w5041677,"groundwater temperature,stream water temperature,groundwater-stream water exchange,time series analysis,Haean basin","TIME-SERIES MEASUREMENTS,SURFACE-WATER,SEDIMENT TEMPERATURE,FLOW,RIVER,HEAT,PROFILES,SYSTEM,IDENTIFICATION,VARIABILITY",,"Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Geol, Chunchon 200701, South Korea"

17,17,"Wysocki, LA",Aug 2006 ,"Spatial variability in the coupling of organic carbon, nutrients, and phytoplankton pigments in surface waters and sediments of the Mississippi River plume",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"River-dominated coastal areas are typically sites of active biogeochemical cycling, with productivity enhanced by terrestrial inputs of nutrients and organic matter. To examine the spatial variability and relationship between river discharge, phytoplankton, and organic carbon distributions, we analyzed surface water and sediment from the Louisiana shelf adjacent to the Mississippi River. Samples were collected during April and October 2000 to capture high and low river discharge, and were analyzed for dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC), nutrients, and phytoplankton pigments. Pigments, determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), were also analyzed from sediment to evaluate marine carbon inputs to the seafloor. DOC in surface waters was generally within 200-300 mu M, ranging up to 399 mu M. Chlorophyll a ranged from below the limits of detection (BLD) up to 31 nM in surface waters, with higher values located further from the river mouth during high flow. Although community diversity increased during low discharge, diatoms dominated the phytoplankton population (50-80% of the community throughout the study) and consequently made more important contributions than other species to both the DOC and POC pools. Chlorophyll and degradation products (indicative of zooplankton grazing) observed in surface sediment indicated a transfer of autochthonous carbon from the highly productive photic zone to the sediment, coupling phytoplankton-derived POC in surface waters with organic carbon deposition in surface sediment. Cross-shelf changes in chlorophyll indicated a westward transport of phytoplankton that was directly and indirectly linked with river discharge and pigment decay dynamics. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

19,19,"Welsch, DL",Aug 31 2006 ,Simulation of future stream alkalinity under changing deposition and climate scenarios,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Models of soil and stream water acidification have typically been applied under scenarios of changing acidic deposition, however, climate change is usually ignored. Soil air CO2 concentrations have potential to increase as climate warms and becomes wetter, thus affecting soil and stream water chemistry by initially increasing stream alkalinity at the expense of reducing base saturation levels on soil exchange sites. We simulate this change by applying a series of physically based coupled models capable of predicting soil air CO2 and stream water chemistry. We predict daily stream water alkalinity for a small catchment in the Virginia Blue Ridge for 60 years into the future given stochastically generated daily climate values. This is done for nine different combinations of climate and deposition. The scenarios for both climate and deposition include a static scenario, a scenario of gradual change, and a scenario of abrupt change. We find that stream water alkalinity continues to decline for all scenarios (average decrease of 14.4 mu eq L-1) except where climate is gradually warming and becoming more moist (average increase of 13 mu eq L-1). In all other scenarios, base cation removal from catchment soils is responsible for limited alkalinity increase resulting from climate change. This has implications given the extent that acidification models are used to establish policy and legislation concerning deposition and emissions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

20,20,"O'Briain, R",Dec 2019 ,River modification reduces climate resilience of brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations in Ireland,FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY,"This study investigated interactions between eco-hydromorphological state, riparian vegetation cover, water temperature and fish community composition in lowland rivers in Ireland. Physical habitat modification of study sites corresponded with degraded eco-hydromorphological state (degree of ecological and physical modification) and reduced thermal buffering capacity (greater temperature fluctuation and increased frequency of extreme temperature events). This impact was reflected in the fish community, with a shift from a brown trout-dominated (Salmo trutta L.) fish assemblage to predominance of the more thermally plastic minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus (L.), and stone loach, Barbatula barbatula (L.). Eco-hydromorphological state may be a central factor affecting the ability of temperate rivers to resist temperature change in a warming climate and to maintain suitable conditions for salmonids and other cold-water biota. Strategies aimed at climate change proofing of temperate rivers should focus on preserving or re-establishing the eco-hydromorphological processes that create habitat complexity and buffer stream temperature.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000496666900005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiver%2Bmodification%2Breduces%2Bclimate%2Bresilience%2Bof%2Bbrown%2Btrout%2B%2528Salmo%2Btrutta%2529%2Bpopulations%2Bin%2BIreland%26rft.aufirst%3DRossa%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DO%2527Briain%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffme.12326%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2400%26rft.epage%3D526%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0969-997X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DFISHERIES%2BMANAGEMENT%2BAND%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D512-526%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D512%26rft.stitle%3DFISHERIES%2BMANAG%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D26%26rft.au%3DO%2527Briain%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DCoghlan%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DKelly%252C%2BFL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=FISHERIES+MANAGEMENT+AND+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/fme.12326,"climate change,eco-hydromorphology,ecological indicators,pressure-state responses,river modification,salmonids,stream temperature","LARGE WOODY DEBRIS,STREAM TEMPERATURES,CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY,WATER TEMPERATURE,CHINOOK SALMON,HETEROGENEITY,BIODIVERSITY,RESTORATION,MANAGEMENT,EXCHANGE",,"Inland Fisheries Ireland, Dublin 24, Ireland"

Data regarding PCN levels and their environmental fate are sparse in China. The PCN concentration and distribution in soils of the Pearl River Delta were reported, and the average total concentration was 59.9 +/- 86.7 pg/g. Tri-CNs was the dominant homologue group, and CN 24 was the most abundant congener. A gradient of PCN levels between more and less developed areas was observed. Based on fugacity fraction results, CN 51 is proposed as a possible source marker for specific combustion emissions. Air-soil exchange of PCNs was estimated by calculating the soil and air fugacity. Fugacity fraction values indicated that tri- to penta-CNs were closer to equilibrium in winter and toward net volatilization in summer, while hexa-CNs experienced net air-to-soil transfer in both seasons.

22,22,"Puckett, MH",Aug 6 2019 ,Application of fractional differential equation to interpret the dynamics of dissolved heavy-metal uptake in streams at a wide range of scales,EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS,"Fractional differential equations (FDEs) provide promising models to simulate non-Fickian transport in heterogeneous systems such as geological media, but the FDEs have seldom been used to model reactive transport across a wide range of spatial scales. To fill the knowledge gap, this study proposed a fractional-order advection-dispersion-reaction (fADR) model to quantify the dynamics of dissolved heavy metals, such as manganese (Mn), moving in streams with oxidative precipitation and sorption in storage zones. The fADR model was applied to fit the Mn concentration profiles documented in the literature at the hyporheic flow path scale (0.30m in length), the reach scale (100-3000m), and the basin scale ( similar to 20000 m) at Pinal Creek, Arizona. Numerical results showed that compared with standard transport models such as the OTIS model and the single-rate mass transfer model, the fADR model can better capture the observed plumes at all scales. This is because the space fractional-diffusive term in the fADR model can capture super-diffusive jumps of dissolved metals driven by turbulence at the bedform scale and flooding in a decade-long time scale. Meanwhile, the time fractional derivative term in the fADR model describes complex solute retention due to multiple-rate mass exchange between the mobile zone (stream or the hyporheic flux) and various storage regimes with different properties (such as streambed sediments and stagnant portions in the hyporheic zone). This does not rely on the equilibrium chemistry condition for solutes in storage zones assumed by standard hyporheic-exchange models. In addition, the first-order reaction in the fADR model can efficiently characterize the mass decline of Mn downstream resulting from enhanced Mn oxidation (such as oxidation of MN(II) to +3 or +4 oxidation states) due to the input of streamflow with increased pH and dissolved oxygen and/or groundwater recharge with high dissolved metals into the hyporheic zone. The decoupled super-diffusion and retention for Mn can exhibit scale-dependent behaviors due to the evolution of driving mechanisms, which can be characterized by the parsimonious, phenomenological FDE by adjusting the indexes. Therefore, the application of FDEs helps us to interpret the physical and geochemical processes in streams across scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000479155600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B377%26rft.atitle%3DApplication%2Bof%2Bfractional%2Bdifferential%2Bequation%2Bto%2Binterpret%2Bthe%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2Bdissolved%2Bheavy-metal%2Buptake%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Bat%2Ba%2Bwide%2Brange%2Bof%2Bscales%26rft.aufirst%3DMary%2BHastings%26rft.auinit%3DMH%26rft.aulast%3DPuckett%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1140%252Fepjp%252Fi2019-12897-1%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2190-5444%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DEUROPEAN%2BPHYSICAL%2BJOURNAL%2BPLUS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DEUR%2BPHYS%2BJ%2BPLUS%26rft.volume%3D134%26rft.au%3DPuckett%252C%2BMH%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DWei%252C%2BW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=EUROPEAN+PHYSICAL+JOURNAL+PLUS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1140/epjp/i2019-12897-1,,"COMPUTATIONAL FLUID-DYNAMICS,REACTIVE SOLUTE TRANSPORT,HYPORHEIC ZONE,MASS-TRANSFER,POROUS-MEDIA,MACRODISPERSION EXPERIMENT,CONTAMINATED STREAM,ANOMALOUS DIFFUSION,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,NATURAL SOURCES",,"Univ Alabama, Dept Geol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA"

Beyond their biological role, the presence of benthic and hyporheic biofilms can play an important role in influencing large-scale transport of solutes, even for conservative tracers. As biofilms grow and accumulate biomass, they actively interact with and influence surface and subsurface flow patterns. To explore this effect, we conducted experiments at the Notre Dame Linked Ecosystems Experimental Facility in four outdoor streams, each with different gravel beds. Over the course of 20weeks we conducted transport experiments in each of these streams and observed different patterns in breakthrough curves as biofilms grew on the substrate. Biofilms played a major role in shaping the observed conservative transport patterns. Overall, while the presence of biofilms led to a decreased exchange rate between the fast (mobile) and slow (immobile) parts of the flow domain, water that was exchanged tended to be stored in the slow regions for longer times once biofilms had established. More specifically, we observed enhanced longitudinal dispersion in breakthrough curves as well as broader residence time distributions when biofilms were present. Biofilm colonization over time homogenized transport patterns across the four streams that were originally very distinct. These results indicate that stream biofilms exert a strong control on conservative solute transport in streams, a role that to date has not received enough attention.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000382581900009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBiofilm%2Bgrowth%2Bin%2Bgravel%2Bbed%2Bstreams%2Bcontrols%2Bsolute%2Bresidence%2Btime%2Bdistributions%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%2BF.%26rft.auinit%3DAF%26rft.aulast%3DAubeneau%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016JG003333%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D1850%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1840-1850%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1840%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D121%26rft.au%3DAubeneau%252C%2BAF%26rft.au%3DHanrahan%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DTank%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016JG003333,"biofilms,streambed,residence time distribution","TRANSIENT STORAGE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,RHODAMINE WT,TRANSPORT,HYDRODYNAMICS,PHOSPHORUS,PERIPHYTON,DISPERSION,NITROGEN,ECOLOGY",,"Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA"
24,24,"Ratliff, KM",Nov 2018 ,Exploring Wave and Sea-Level Rise Effects on Delta Morphodynamics With a Coupled River-Ocean Model,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE,"Deltas, which are often densely populated, have become more vulnerable to flooding due to increasing rates of sea-level rise and decreasing sediment supply. These landscapes grow through the successive stacking of delta lobes, as abrupt changes in the river's course episodically alter the river mouth's location. The dynamics of these channel avulsions determine the location and size of delta lobes. We use a newly developed coupled model of river and coastal processes to explore how changing wave climates (varying wave heights and offshore approach angles) and a range of sea-level rise rates affect avulsion processes and large-scale delta morphology. Although the relative impacts of the fluvial sediment flux and wave influence have long been studied and more recently quantified, we find that the sign and magnitude of wave climate diffusivity both play important roles in determining not only delta morphology but also avulsion dynamics. We also find, surprisingly, that increasing sea-level rise rates do not always accelerate avulsions. If the river channel is prograding rapidly enough, relative to the rate of sea-level rise, then avulsion frequency will not be significantly affected by the rate of sea-level rise. This finding highlights important differences between wave and river-dominated deltas, as well as between prototypical deltas and experimental deltas created in the lab. The wave climate, sea-level rise rate, and critical superelevation required to trigger an avulsion all play important roles in determining the degree of autogenic variability operating in delta systems, which has implications for both avulsion dynamics and interpretation of delta stratigraphy.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000453003800009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExploring%2BWave%2Band%2BSea-Level%2BRise%2BEffects%2Bon%2BDelta%2BMorphodynamics%2BWith%2Ba%2BCoupled%2BRiver-Ocean%2BModel%26rft.aufirst%3DKatherine%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DKM%26rft.aulast%3DRatliff%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018JF004757%26rft.eissn%3D2169-9011%26rft.epage%3D2900%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9003%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-EARTH%2BSURFACE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2887-2900%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2887%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-EARTH%26rft.volume%3D123%26rft.au%3DRatliff%252C%2BKM%26rft.au%3DHutton%252C%2BEHW%26rft.au%3DMurray%252C%2BAB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-EARTH+SURFACE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018JF004757,"delta morphodynamics,river avulsion,sea-level rise,autogenic variability,wave climate","MISSISSIPPI RIVER,AVULSION,VARIABILITY,COASTLINE,DYNAMICS,SYSTEM,SPAIN,BASIN",,"Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA"
25,25,"Bustillo, V",Apr 2011 ,Factors driving the biogeochemical budget of the Amazon River and its statistical modelling,COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE,"The seasonal and interannual fluctuations of the biogeochemical budget (solutes, suspended matter, isotopes) of the Amazon River basin were analyzed, with a special focus on 44 physicochemical parameters monitored over the period 1982-1984 during the Carbon in the AMazon River Experiment (CAMREX) project. The relevant factors driving this variability were identified and sorted through the implementation of a statistical-regressive model coupled to variance analysis. Basically, the compositional fluctuations in the Amazon River are related (1) to the variable contribution of major tributaries (variable regional source) to the river flow but also (2) to the variable contribution of hydrological sources, (3) to river processes, i.e. in-stream diagenesis and sediment dynamics and (4) to the hydrological budget of the floodplains. Their respective contributions to the variability of chemical signals observed in the stream waters depend on which parameter was investigated but their combination explains on average 85% of the observed variability. The variability related to regional sources was captured by the compared measures of flow discharge and biogeochemical fluxes at the outlet of the major tributaries. The variability of hydrological sources was described by the variable contribution of three runoffs of distinct but constant composition: forwarded direct runoff, delayed floodplain runoff and baseflow. Several methods were tested to depict the seasonal and interannual variations of their individual discharges. Biologically-mediated processes were related to a hydrobiological index I-BIO = [O-2]-[CO2] which allows tracking the nature of the dominant ecological regime (autotrophy vs. heterotrophy). The alteration of chemical signals related to the intermittent discharge of the floodplains (where specific processes occur such as: gas exchanges at the air-water interface, sorption of dissolved organic matter, chemical weathering, deposition vs. remobilization of sediments, etc.) was simulated by taking into account the default of hydrological balance between inflows and outflows, used as a marker of floodplains discharge. This analysis shows that the chemical baseline observed in the waters of the Amazon River is mostly acquired upstream from the junction of major tributaries with the Amazon main reach.

Those two river systems transport sediments into foreland or hinterland basin and flank basin. Longitudinal river systems prevail in and around the Tibetan Plateau due to the fact that they flow parallel to the strike of structures within the developing mountain belt. The flank basins surrounded the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas are developed in different tectonic settings, including inland, continental margin and deep ocean, most of them containing oil and natural gas. Those basins not only have longer evolution histories than foreland basins but also are more complete in their records of deposition. Coupling of orogeny and flank basin deposition also occurred widely in pre-Cenozoic time, in particular, the coupling between the Qinling orogenic belt and Songpan-Ganzi flysch flank basin is the most distinctive. The evolution of ancient latitudinal rivers derived from the Qinling orogenic belt during periods of mountain building was controlled not only by landforms but also by the lateral extrusion of the crustal fragments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000220723800018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2Bimportant%2Bform%2Bof%2Bbasin-mountain%2Bcoupling%253A%2BOrogenic%2Bbelt%2Band%2Bflank%2Bbasin%26rft.aufirst%3DW%26rft.auinit%3DW%26rft.aulast%3DErchie%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1360%252F03wd0402%26rft.eissn%3D1861-9541%26rft.epage%3D636%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1001-6538%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DCHINESE%2BSCIENCE%2BBULLETIN%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D632-636%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D632%26rft.stitle%3DCHINESE%2BSCI%2BBULL%26rft.volume%3D49&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=CHINESE+SCIENCE+BULLETIN&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1360/03wd0402,"basin-mountain coupling,longitudinal and transverse rivers,Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","RIVER,COLLISION,EVOLUTION,SYSTEMS",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geol & Geophys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China"

Theory,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH,"The variation of streaming potentials (voltage/pressure cross-coupling coefficient) with temperature is examined with particular emphasis on the effect of temperature on zeta potentials. The variation of streaming potential with temperature cannot be explained solely by the known temperature dependence of water viscosity, permittivity, and conductivity; the change of zeta potential with temperature must also be included. Many previous experimental studies show that the magnitude of the zeta potential increases with temperature. It was found in this study that the increase is controlled primarily by the surface charge density. These changes are influenced by the absorption properties of the surface and thus the surface charge, which in turn affects the Stern layer charge and properties of the electrical double layer. It is found that the slope of the temperature versus zeta potential curve is controlled by the change in enthalpy of the surface reactions. It was also found that viscosity is the most dominant term in the coupling coefficient, but changes in the conductivity model used to determine zeta potentials can also affect streaming potential coupling coefficient results. For the cases studied, the temperature-dependent zeta potential is determined by the temperature-dependent behavior of the Debye-Huckel parameter, 4%; the diffuse layer of electrical double layer (EDL), 6%; and the surface charge, 90%. The Revil and Glover model was able to account for much of the change in the surface charge density caused by changes in temperature.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000186942600002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2546%26rft.atitle%3DTemperature-dependent%2Bstreaming%2Bpotentials%253A%2B1.%2BTheory%26rft.aufirst%3DPM%26rft.auinit%3DPM%26rft.aulast%3DReppert%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2002JB001754%26rft.eissn%3D2169-9356%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9313%26rft.issue%3DB11%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-SOLID%2BEARTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-SOL%2BEA%26rft.volume%3D108%26rft.au%3DReppert%252C%2BPM%26rft.au%3DMorgan%252C%2BFD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-SOLID+EARTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2002JB001754,"electrokinetic,streaming potential,temperature,zeta potential","SOLID-SOLUTION INTERFACE,ELECTRICAL DOUBLE-LAYER,ELECTROKINETIC PHENOMENA,ZERO CHARGE,ANOMALIES,WATER,ADSORPTION,(HYDR)OXIDES,TOMOGRAPHY,OXIDES",,"MIT, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, Earth Resources Lab, 42 Carleton St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA"

The design principle relies on phase matching QE-excited circularly diverging surface plasmons to a well-collimated off-normal propagating photon stream by using a modified bullseye antenna with circular nanoridges having appropriately displaced centers. We demonstrate with the simulations that the hybrid plasmon-QE coupled metasurfaces enable highly directional off-normal photon emission with collection efficiencies exceeding 96%.

29,29,"O'Neal, JA",Sep 15 2013 ,Phosphate recovery using hybrid anion exchange: Applications to source-separated urine and combined wastewater streams,WATER RESEARCH,"There is increasing interest in recovering phosphorus (P) from various wastewater streams for beneficial use as fertilizer and to minimize environmental impacts of excess P on receiving waters. One such example is P recovery from human urine, which has a high concentration of phosphate (200-800 mg P/L) and accounts for a small volume (similar to 1%) of total wastewater flow. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to evaluate the potential to recover P from source-separated and combined wastewater streams that included undiluted human urine, urine diluted with tap water, greywater, mixture of urine and greywater, anaerobic digester supernatant, and secondary wastewater effluent. A hybrid anion exchange (HAIX) resin containing hydrous ferric oxide was used to recover P because of its selectivity for phosphate and the option to precipitate P minerals in the waste regeneration solution. The P recovery potential was fresh urine > hydrolyzed urine > greywater > biological wastewater effluent > anaerobic digester supernatant. The maximum loading of P on HAIX resin was fresh urine > hydrolyzed urine > anaerobic digester supernatant approximate to greywater > biological wastewater effluent. Results indicated that the sorption capacity of HAIX resin for phosphate and the total P recovery potential were greater for source-separated urine than the combined wastewater streams of secondary wastewater effluent and anaerobic digester supernatant.

30,30,"Rajamony, J",Dec 2001 ,The cross-stream potential vorticity front and its role in meander-induced exchange in the Gulf Stream,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,"The potential vorticity (PV) front observed in the upper thermocline at the northern edge of the Gulf Stream has been thought of as an inhibitor to lateral motion of parcels on isopycnals. The role of the PV front in relation to lateral motion and cross-stream exchange was investigated by monitoring the evolving PV field in the vicinity of Lagrangian parcels at the northern edge of the stream. The observational study involved shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and conductivity-temperature-depth surveys to sample the velocity and density fields around water parcels as they flowed through meanders. The observations reveal that the PV field in the vicinity of parcels moves laterally across the stream and evolves as parcels negotiate meander crests and troughs, allowing parcels to move across the stream without changing their Lagrangian PV. This lateral motion of the PV front suggests that it is more a response to than an inhibitor of the lateral motion of parcels in the meanders. The relative contributions of the components of PV to the front indicated a rich structure of changes in shear and stretching across the stream. Also, temperature changes of Lagrangian parcels were linked to small-scale mixing processes associated with observed intrusive features. Estimated diffusion coefficients suggest that horizontal mixing could be the main mechanism of mixing in the upper thermocline at the northern edge of the stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000172903300012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bcross-stream%2Bpotential%2Bvorticity%2Bfront%2Band%2Bits%2Brole%2Bin%2Bmeander-induced%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bthe%2BGulf%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DJ%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DRajamony%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1175%252F1520-0485%25282001%2529031%253C3551%253ATCSPVF%253E2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D3568%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-3670%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BPHYSICAL%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3551-3568%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3551%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BPHYS%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DRajamony%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DHebert%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DRossby%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+PHYSICAL+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1175/1520-0485(2001)031<3551:TCSPVF>2.0.CO;2,,"WESTERN BOUNDARY CURRENTS,QUASI-GEOSTROPHIC OCEAN,TRAJECTORIES,TEMPERATURE,SIGNATURES,TRANSPORT,PARCELS,JET",,"Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA"
31,31,"Simpson, ZP",Oct 2 2022 ,Sediment and water-column phosphorus chemistry in streams at baseflow across varying catchment geologies,INLAND WATERS,"Streams can attenuate inputs of phosphorus (P) and therefore dampen the likelihood of ecosystem eutrophication. This P attenuation derives from many processes and remains poorly understood, particularly in reference to the geochemical mechanisms involved. We studied P attenuation in the form of (1) potential for mineral (co-)precipitation from the water column and (2) P sorption with benthic sediments. We hypothesized that both mechanisms vary with catchment geology and that P sorption depends on sediment reactive iron (Fe). We sampled 31 streams at baseflow, covering a gradient of P inputs (via land use), hydrological characteristics, and catchment geologies. Geochemical equilibria in the water column were measured and benthic sediments were analyzed for sorption properties and P and Fe fractions. Neither P-containing minerals nor calcite-phosphate co-precipitation had the potential to form. However, in-stream dissolved reactive P (DRP) correlated with labile sediment P (water soluble and easily reduced Fe-P) for streams where hyporheic exchange between the water column and sediment porewaters was likely sufficient. Because this labile P was associated with poorly crystalline Fe oxides, which determined P sorption capacity, we observed that more sorptive sediments were positively related to DRP concentrations. Our results suggest that DRP attenuation in these streams at baseflow depends in part on the combination of biogeochemical Fe and P cycles and the hydrological exchange with the hyporheic zone. Such combinations will likely vary spatiotemporally within a catchment and must be considered alongside inputs of P and sediment if the P concentrations at baseflow, and eutrophication risk, are to be well managed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000821048900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSediment%2Band%2Bwater-column%2Bphosphorus%2Bchemistry%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Bat%2Bbaseflow%2Bacross%2Bvarying%2Bcatchment%2Bgeologies%26rft.aufirst%3DZachary%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DZP%26rft.aulast%3DSimpson%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F20442041.2022.2052785%26rft.eissn%3D2044-205X%26rft.epage%3D525%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2044-2041%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DINLAND%2BWATERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D510-525%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D510%26rft.stitle%3DINLAND%2BWATERS%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DSimpson%252C%2BZP%26rft.au%3DMcDowell%252C%2BRW%26rft.au%3DCondron%252C%2BLM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=INLAND+WATERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/20442041.2022.2052785,"baseflow,buffer,calcite,eutrophication,retention,sorption","BED SEDIMENTS,NUTRIENT-UPTAKE,HEADWATER CATCHMENTS,PHOSPHATE SORPTION,RIVER,IRON,FLOW,RETENTION,SURFACE,FRACTIONATION",,"Iowa State Univ, QDept Agron, 2104 Agron Hall,716 Farm House Lane, Ames, IA 50011 USA"

This is of particular importance in closed and/or marginal seas such as the South China Sea. We report on the magnetic properties of sedimentary samples collected in three main Asian rivers draining into the South China Sea: the Pearl, Red, and Mekong Rivers. The geological formations as well as the present climatic conditions are different from one catchment to another. The entire set of performed magnetic analyses (low-field magnetic susceptibility, ARM acquisition and decay, IRM acquisition and decay, back-field acquisition, thermal demagnetization of three-axes IRM, hysteresis parameters, FORC diagrams, and low-temperature magnetic measurements) allow us to identify the magnetic mineralogy and the grain-size distribution when magnetite is dominant. Some degree of variability is observed in each basin, illustrating different parent rocks and degree of weathering. On average it appears that the Pearl River is rich in magnetite along the main stream while the Mekong River is rich in hematite. The Red River is a mixture of the two. Compared to clay mineral assemblages and major element contents previously determined on the same samples, these new findings indicate that the magnetic fraction brings complementary information of great interest for environmental reconstructions based on marine sediments from the South China Sea.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000379525100007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMagnetic%2Bminerals%2Bin%2Bthree%2BAsian%2Brivers%2Bdraining%2Binto%2Bthe%2BSouth%2BChina%2BSea%253A%2BPearl%252C%2BRed%252C%2Band%2BMekong%2BRivers%26rft.aufirst%3DCatherine%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DKissel%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016GC006283%26rft.epage%3D1693%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1525-2027%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOCHEMISTRY%2BGEOPHYSICS%2BGEOSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1678-1693%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1678%26rft.stitle%3DGEOCHEM%2BGEOPHY%2BGEOSY%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DKissel%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BZF%26rft.au%3DWandres%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=GEOCHEMISTRY+GEOPHYSICS+GEOSYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016GC006283,"river sediments,magnetic mineralogy,Southeast Asia","ISOTHERMAL REMANENT MAGNETIZATION,ACQUISITION CURVES,SUSPENDED SEDIMENT,FLUVIAL SEDIMENTS,NORTH-ATLANTIC,HOLOCENE,DELTA,TRANSPORT,DISCHARGE,VIETNAM",,"Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France"
33,33,"Hyun, Y",May 25 2011 ,"Characterizing streambed water fluxes using temperature and head data on multiple spatial scales in Munsan stream, South Korea",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Accurate characterization of water fluxes in the streambed where surface water-ground water (SW-GW) interacts is essential to evaluate the fate and transport of a contaminant plume and to investigate aquatic ecosystems in aquifers connected to rivers or streams. Vertical streambed water fluxes were characterized on multiple spatial scales using temperature-depth profiles and head data measured in a reach of Munsan stream, Paju-si, South Korea. This study applied an exponential model and type curves to determine water fluxes on a large scale of aquifer thickness including a streambed (=15 m) under the assumption of steady state heat transport. On a small scale of the streambed (=0.3 m) Darcy's law was used to calculate water fluxes through the streambed. The results showed that regional ground water discharges occurred to the stream through the streambed over the reach considered in both August, 2008 and January, 2009 while significant spatial variability in vertical streambed fluxes was found for the streambed of 0.3 m in thickness due to heterogeneities in streambed hydraulic conductivity, variations in stream discharge, and hydraulic gradients in the streambed. Therefore, it is concluded that vertical water fluxes in the streambed of the site are affected by regional ground water flow moving from a deep aquifer to stream and by local small-scale upward or downward hyporheic flow simultaneously. From seepage flux estimates and electrical conductivity (EC) data of water samples, the origins of water in the streambed were inferred. It suggested that SW-GW mixing zones were present at 0.3 m deep or probably even deeper streambeds at S3-S5 located in mid- to downstream at the site. Results have significant implications on effective water resources managements and aquatic habitat investigations in ground water dependent ecosystems of the site. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

34,34,"Sabo, JL",Jul 2002 ,River-watershed exchange: Effects of riverine subsidies on riparian lizards and their terrestrial prey,ECOLOGY,"Resource subsidies from external habitats can enhance the performance or population density of local consumers, altering their effects on in situ prey. Indirect effects of subsidies may be either positive or negative depending on the behavior of the shared consumer. Here we document strong links between riverine insects, riparian lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), and terrestrial invertebrates. We hypothesized that aquatic insects subsidize riparian lizard populations leading to higher growth rates of these lizards in near-river habitats, and that subsidies exert short-term positive effects on terrestrial resources as a result of diet shifts by lizards to aquatic insects. To test these hypotheses, we used 2 m high fences, or ""subsidy shields,"" to experimentally reduce aquatic insect flux to large (91 m 2) enclosures of lizards. Subsidy shields reduced aquatic insect flux by 55-65%. Growth rates of lizards were 7X higher in subsidized (no-shield) enclosures during the early summer but were not significantly different later in the summer, when ambient fluxes of aquatic insects dropped to 20% of their early season levels. Within the watershed, lizard growth rates (in mass) were positively correlated with the numerical abundance of aquatic insects. Thus, lizard growth rates tracked both seasonal and spatial availability of riverine insect subsidies during our experiment. Subsidies also had indirect effects on the ground-dwelling, terrestrial prey of lizards. Declines of diurnal terrestrial invertebrates Were significantly higher in shield than no-shield enclosures, and the most common ground spider (Arctosa sp. [Lycosidae]) disappeared completely from shield enclosures by the end of the experiment. Declines in terrestrial invertebrate abundance did not differ between no-shield enclosures and lizard exclosures. These data suggest that riverine insects subsidize riparian Sceloporus and, in the short term, reduce their predation on terrestrial arthropods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000176718100007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiver-watershed%2Bexchange%253A%2BEffects%2Bof%2Briverine%2Bsubsidies%2Bon%2Briparian%2Blizards%2Band%2Btheir%2Bterrestrial%2Bprey%26rft.aufirst%3DJL%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DSabo%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F3071770%26rft.epage%3D1869%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-9658%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1860-1869%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1860%26rft.stitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D83%26rft.au%3DSabo%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DPower%252C%2BME&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[1860:RWEEOR]2.0.CO;2,"Arctosa sp.,functional response,ground spieler,lizard,predation,riparian,river,river-watershed exchange,Sceloporus occidentalis,subsidy,watershed","BENTHIC-PELAGIC LINKS,FOOD-WEB,APPARENT COMPETITION,SECONDARY PRODUCTION,AQUATIC INSECTS,STREAM,COMMUNITIES,MARINE,ISLANDS,INVERTEBRATES",,"Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, POB 871501, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA"

The NFIE organizers introduced a national-scale distributed hydrologic modeling framework that can provide flow estimates at around 2.67million reaches within the continental United States. The framework generates discharges by coupling a given Land Surface Model (LSM) with the Routing Application for Parallel Computation of Discharge (RAPID). These discharges are then accumulated through the National Hydrography Dataset Plus stream network. The framework can utilize a variety of LSMs to provide the runoff maps to the routing component. The results obtained from this framework suggested that there still exists room for further enhancements to its performance, especially in the area of peak timing and magnitude. The goal of our study was to investigate a single source of the errors in the framework's discharge estimates, which is the routing component. The authors substitute RAPID which is based on the simplified linear Muskingum routing method by the nonlinear routing component the Iowa Flood Center have incorporated in their full hydrologic Hillslope-Link Model. Our results show improvement in model performance across scales due to incorporating new routing methodology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434120900012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2BInvestigation%2Bof%2BErrors%2Bin%2BDistributed%2BModels%2527%2BStream%2BDischarge%2BPrediction%2BDue%2Bto%2BChannel%2BRouting%26rft.aufirst%3DMohamed%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DElSaadani%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.12627%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D751%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D742-751%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D742%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DElSaadani%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DKrajewski%252C%2BWF%26rft.au%3DSmith%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/1752-1688.12627,"surface water hydrology,NFIE,runoff,rivers,streams,NHDPlus","MUSKINGUM METHOD,RIVER,QUANTIFICATION,SPEEDUP",,"Univ Louisiana Lafayette, Inst Coastal & Water Res, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA"
36,36,"Pellicer-Martinez, F",Sep 15 2015 ,Analysis of incorporating groundwater exchanges in hydrological models,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In many catchments, the geographical demarcation does not coincide with the limits of the aquifers, so groundwater may be exchanged beyond their topographic boundaries. By studying groundwater exchanges, the natural resources of a catchment can be better assessed, and the divergences between hydrological models and measurements can be explained. The aim of this work is to reveal the importance of including groundwater exchanges in the hydrological modelling of some catchments, using a water balance model. For this purpose, a simple example is conducted. The so-called parent model scheme is modified to only allow groundwater exchanges, and it is applied to the headwater of the Segura River Basin District, located in the southeast of Spain. This area is selected because groundwater plays an important role in surface hydrology. The results reveal that groundwater exchanges cannot be neglected in some catchments when assessing water resources because their integration in the hydrological model corrects errors in the water balance. Moreover, this paper proves that water balance models are a useful tool for estimating groundwater exchanges between catchments, which can be contrasted with more complex distributed models or isotopic tracers if there is enough information available.

37,37,"Fritz, KM",Nov 2011 ,Invertebrate colonization of leaves and roots within sediments of intermittent Coastal Plain streams across hydrologic phases,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Ecological flows between habitats are vital for predicting and understanding structure and function of recipient systems. Ecological flows across riparian areas and headwater intermittent streams are likely to be especially important in many river networks because of the shear extent of these interfaces, their high edge-to-width ratio, and the alternation of wet and dry conditions in intermittent channels. While there has been substantial research supporting the importance of riparian-stream linkages above-ground, comparatively less research has investigated below-ground linkages. We tested the hypothesis that riparian roots are colonized by invertebrates as a food source within stream beds of intermittent headwater streams. We compared benthic invertebrate assemblages colonizing three types of buried substrates (leaves, roots, and plastic roots) among three intermittent Coastal Plain streams, each with a different riparian management treatment (clearcut, thinned, and reference), over a I-year period. Invertebrate density was significantly lower in root litterbags than in plastic roots litterbags, but neither differed from densities in leaf litterbags. Total invertebrate abundances, however, were significantly higher in leaf and root litterbags compared to abundances in plastic root litterbags. Invertebrate biomass and richness did not vary among substrates, but invertebrate density, abundance, and richness all declined from the wet phase (September-December) through the dry phase (June-August). Meiofauna and aquatic dipterans were the primary colonizing invertebrates during the wet phase. Relative abundance of terrestrial taxa increased during the dry phase, but their absolute abundance remained lower than aquatic taxa during the wet phase. Invertebrate composition did not differ among substrate types, but was significantly different among streams and time periods. Cumulative number of dry days, degree days, and redox depth all strongly correlated with assemblage structure as indicated by ordination scores. Our results suggest that subsurface invertebrates respond to leaves and roots as food sources, but assemblage composition is not substrate specific. Colonization of leaves and roots within stream beds by aquatic and terrestrial taxa supports the idea that headwater intermittent streams are important interfaces for the reciprocal exchange of energy and materials between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000296533400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInvertebrate%2Bcolonization%2Bof%2Bleaves%2Band%2Broots%2Bwithin%2Bsediments%2Bof%2Bintermittent%2BCoastal%2BPlain%2Bstreams%2Bacross%2Bhydrologic%2Bphases%26rft.aufirst%3DKen%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DKM%26rft.aulast%3DFritz%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-011-0192-9%26rft.epage%3D469%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D459-469%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D459%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D73%26rft.au%3DFritz%252C%2BKM%26rft.au%3DFeminella%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00027-011-0192-9,"Organic matter,Riparian,Temporary stream,Drying,Meiofauna,Terrestrial invertebrates","PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER,LOW-GRADIENT STREAM,LEAF-LITTER,TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES,HEADWATER STREAMS,VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION,GROUNDWATER NITRATE,WESTERN OREGON,RIVER,FOOD",,"US EPA, Ecol Exposure Res Div, Natl Exposure Res Lab, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA"
38,38,"Kornis, MS",Jul 2015 ,Fish community dynamics following dam removal in a fragmented agricultural stream,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Habitat fragmentation impedes dispersal of aquatic fauna, and barrier removal is increasingly used to increase stream network connectivity and facilitate fish dispersal. Improved understanding of fish community response to barrier removal is needed, especially in fragmented agricultural streams where numerous antiquated dams are likely destined for removal. We examined post-removal responses in two distinct fish communities formerly separated by a small aging mill dam. The dam was removed midway through the 6 year study, enabling passage for downstream fishes affiliated with a connected reservoir into previously inaccessible habitat, thus creating the potential for taxonomic homogenization between upstream and downstream communities. Both communities changed substantially post-removal. Two previously excluded species (white sucker, yellow perch) established substantial populations upstream of the former dam, contributing to a doubling of total fish biomass. Meanwhile, numerical density of pre-existing upstream fishes declined. Downstream, largemouth bass density was inversely correlated with prey fish density throughout the study, while post-removal declines in bluegill density coincided with cooler water temperature and increased suspended and benthic fine sediment. Upstream and downstream fish communities became more similar post-removal, represented by a shift in Bray-Curtis index from 14 to 41 % similarity. Our findings emphasize that barrier removal in highly fragmented stream networks can facilitate the unintended and possibly undesirable spread of species into headwater streams, including dispersal of species from remaining reservoirs. We suggest that knowledge of dispersal patterns for key piscivore and competitor species in both the target system and neighboring systems may help predict community outcomes following barrier removal.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000358863500012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFish%2Bcommunity%2Bdynamics%2Bfollowing%2Bdam%2Bremoval%2Bin%2Ba%2Bfragmented%2Bagricultural%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DMatthew%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DMS%26rft.aulast%3DKornis%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-014-0391-2%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D480%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D465-480%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D465%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D77%26rft.au%3DKornis%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DWeidel%252C%2BBC%26rft.au%3DKitchell%252C%2BJF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00027-014-0391-2,"Dam removal,Fish communities,Fragmented streams,Homogenization,Species interactions,Connectivity","SUCKER CATOSTOMUS-COMMERSONI,FRESH-WATER FAUNAS,LOW-HEAD DAM,UNITED-STATES,BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION,BANK EROSION,LIFE-HISTORY,BROOK TROUT,RIVER,WISCONSIN",,"US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Green Bay Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, 2661 Scott Tower Dr, New Franken, WI 54229 USA"

The main objective of the study is to adequately explore the coupling and coordinated relationship of water utilization (WU), industrial development (ID) and ecological welfare (EW) in the YRB. Compared with previous empirical studies, we establish the estimation indicators of three subsystems, and analyze the relationship and influencing factors of the subsystems of county-level cities in the YRB from 2001 to 2020 by adopting the spatial global (local) autocorrelation and Spatial Error Tobit model. Although the overall development of WU, ID and EW in the YRB had always been the highest in the lower reaches, followed by the middle and upper reaches, the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of the subsystems showed a downward trend as a whole, and there was still great potential for the improvement of the subsystems in common development. Specifically, the spatial distribution of the CCD of the subsystems presented a downward trend from the lower reaches to the middle and upper reaches, and the south of the trunk line was higher than the north. Meanwhile, the CCDs of the subsystems exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation, and the high-level CCDs were distributed in the middle and lower reaches, and vice versa, mainly located in the upper reaches. At present, the CCDs of the three subsystems in the YRB can be divided into five types: WU-led, ID-led, EW-led, synchronous development I, and synchronous development II. The improvement of CCD now mainly depends on the economic development, urbanization level, technological innovation and government capacity, whereas population density, environ-mental regulations and trade openness significantly restrained the increase of the CCD. To achieve the unity of the three subsystems in the YRB, the decision-maker should design related policies, as discussed in the countermeasures.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000879975700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B134824%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Band%2Bcoordinated%2Brelationship%2Bof%2Bwater%2Butilization%252C%2Bindustrial%2Bdevelopment%2Band%2Becological%2Bwelfare%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BBasin%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DYingjie%26rft.auinit%3DYJ%26rft.aulast%3DFeng%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jclepro.2022.134824%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1786%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0959-6526%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BCLEANER%2BPRODUCTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.part%3D2%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BCLEAN%2BPROD%26rft.volume%3D379%26rft.au%3DFeng%252C%2BYJ%26rft.au%3DZhu%252C%2BAK%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BZL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+CLEANER+PRODUCTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134824,"Coupling coordination degree,Water utilization,Industrial development,Ecological welfare,Yellow river basin,China","RESOURCE UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY,ECONOMIC-GROWTH,OPTIMIZATION,TRANSFORMATION,QUALITY,ENERGY,MODEL",,"Zhengzhou Univ Aeronaut, Sch Econ, 15 Wenyuan West Rd, Zhengzhou 450046, Peoples R China"

Validations against marine buoy-observed surface wind, sea level pressure (SLP), air temperature and sea surface temperature (SST) show decent model skill. Model analyses indicate that the surface wind convergence and the Laplacian of SLP and SST are proportionate on the synoptic time scale. Strong upward vertical motions and ocean heat loss over the GS support rapid ETC intensification.

Our results indicated that diurnal and seasonal patterns of NEE and its components (ecosystem respiration (R (eco)), gross primary production (GPP)) varied markedly among months for the growing season (May to October). The cumulative CO2 emission was 1,657 g CO2 m(-2), while 2,612 g CO2 m(-2) was approximately accumulated as GPP, which resulted in the reed wetland being a net sink of 956 g CO2 m(-2). The ratio of R (eco) to GPP in reed wetland was 0.68, which was close to other temperate wetlands. Soil temperature and soil moisture exerted the primary controls on R (eco) during the growing season. Daytime NEE values during the growing season were strongly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation. Aboveground biomass showed significant linear relationships with 24-h average NEE, daytime GPP, and R (eco), respectively. Thus, we conclude that the coastal wetland acted as a carbon sink during the growing season despite the variations in environmental conditions, and long-term flux measurements over these ecosystems are undoubtedly necessary.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000316015000013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEnvironmental%2BControls%2Bon%2BNet%2BEcosystem%2BCO2%2BExchange%2BOver%2Ba%2BReed%2B%2528Phragmites%2Baustralis%2529%2BWetland%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BDelta%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DGuangxuan%26rft.auinit%3DGX%26rft.aulast%3DHan%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12237-012-9572-1%26rft.eissn%3D1559-2731%26rft.epage%3D413%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1559-2723%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DESTUARIES%2BAND%2BCOASTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D401-413%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D401%26rft.stitle%3DESTUAR%2BCOAST%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DHan%252C%2BGX%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BLQ%26rft.au%3DGao%252C%2BYJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=ESTUARIES+AND+COASTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12237-012-9572-1,"Net ecosystem CO2 exchange,Eddy covariance,Coastal wetlands,Environmental control,Yellow River Delta","CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE,SEASONAL-VARIATION,SOIL RESPIRATION,EDDY COVARIANCE,PLANT BIOMASS,TEMPERATURE,WATER,DYNAMICS,MARSH,STRATEGIES",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Key Lab Coastal Environm Proc, Chunhui Rd 17, Yantai 264003, Shandong, Peoples R China"
42,42,"Mason, SJK",May 17 2012 ,"Hydrologic response to channel reconfiguration on Silver Bow Creek, Montana",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrologic residence time in streams is rarely considered as a response variable for assessing restoration design strategies. However, residence time is an important control on ecosystem processes such as the biotic uptake and processing of excess nutrients and other pollutants in streams. Interactions between the physical structure of streambeds and the patterns of flow through the channel determine hydrologic residence time and largely control solute transport and exchange among various channel habitats and the hyporheic zone. The influence of reach-scale channel reconfiguration on residence time is not well characterized despite documented linkages between streambed topography, channel pattern, hydrologic retention, water quality, and in-stream habitat. This study documents changes in hydrologic transport and variation in channel water velocity prior to and immediately following large-scale channel realignment along Silver Bow Creek in southwestern Montana. Channel restoration increased water residence time in the channel by increasing sinuosity, decreasing channel slope, and increasing pool frequency. However, channel realignment yielded a reduction in the fine-scale variation in streambed topography. Water velocity profiles in post-realignment channels, thus, exhibited greater uniformity at short spatial scales. As a result, and possibly due to loss of hyporheic exchange, transient storage within the system declined after channel realignment, offsetting some of the increase in residence time associated with slower advective velocities. We conclude that restoration actions may be more effective at recovering normative hydrologic function if goal setting, planning and design efforts consider the hydrologic effects and ecological benefits of fine-scale (cm-m) topographic stream-bed variation and the bio-geomorphic processes that create and maintain such fine-scale variation over time.

Particle sizes of streambed sediment upstream and midstream of the Tarim River were analysed and, coupled with data on water temperature and run-off, the spatial and temporal variation in K was studied. The results of the study were as follows. (1) In 132 sediment samples, the particle size was less than 5 mm; the sediment was predominantly sandy; and the Sauerbrei's formula proved to be the most reliable empirical formula.

Some of these communities continue to exist today and still have a relationship with the roads. Most of these road networks were mapped before the arrival of the Incas and continue to serve the different communities that provide maintenance through mingas. Archaeological and historical studies show a high presence of Canari, Puruha and Inca peoples that left their mark in these places. An important road ascends to Cerro Pm lay on the north side, from the localities of Nantza, Hui gra and Pagma; a path that could be considered religious based on the qualities of its construction. Another valuable route is the one that crosses between Nantza and Nizag, which the Incas connected to the Qhapaq Nan of the Nudo del Azuay sector; it also served as a connection to the coastal region. These routes were rebuilt and used by the Inca Empire.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000455383500007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAboriginal%2BRoads%2BConnected%2Bto%2Bthe%2BQhapaq%2BNan%252C%2Bthe%2BChanchan%2BRiver%2BBasin%252C%2BChimborazo%2BProvince%252C%2BEcuador%26rft.aufirst%3DMary%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DJadan%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft.epage%3D64%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1989-4104%26rft.jtitle%3DARQUEOLOGIA%2BIBEROAMERICANA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D54-64%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D54%26rft.stitle%3DARQUEOL%2BIBEROAM%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DJadan%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DCarretero%252C%2BPA%26rft.au%3DGalarza%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=ARQUEOLOGIA+IBEROAMERICANA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"Aboriginal roads,Qhapaq Nan,Canari,Puruha,Chanchan River,Punay,Nizag",,,"Registro SENESCYT, Reg Inv 18, Quito 02771, Ecuador"

46,46,"Koronkevich, NI",Jul 2021 ,Transboundary Water Exchange in Russia,WATER RESOURCES,"Different types of transboundary water exchange in Russia are considered, including through state, administrative, and natural boundaries. The presented characteristics refer to atmospheric moisture transport, wind induced mixing of snow, water transport in the form of runoff through the boundaries of individual landscape elements and through the boundaries of natural zones. The extent of the transport of water as a component of production is evaluated. The water transport through Russian boundaries is the largest in the atmosphere and with sea currents. The transboundary river inflow accounts for 4-5% of the total resources of river flow in Russia, and the outflow accounts for 1-2%. Much larger transboundary river water exchange takes place between individual constituent territories of the Russian Federation. Thus, the water resources of Astrakhan oblast are almost entirely formed by the transit flow of the Volga. River water exchange between constituent territories of the Russian Federation, its federal districts, and nearby states, as well as the effect of transboundary water exchange on water quality receive special attention. The major problems associated with transboundary water transport and ways of their solution are identified.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000678071900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTransboundary%2BWater%2BExchange%2Bin%2BRussia%26rft.aufirst%3DN.%26rft.auinit%3DNI%26rft.aulast%3DKoronkevich%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1134%252FS0097807821040072%26rft.eissn%3D1608-344X%26rft.epage%3D511%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0097-8078%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D502-511%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D502%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%252B%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DKoronkevich%252C%2BNI%26rft.au%3DBarabanova%252C%2BEA%26rft.au%3DZaitseva%252C%2BIS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1134/S0097807821040072,"water exchange,state boundaries,administrative boundaries,natural boundaries,atmospheric water transport,river flow,pollution,basin agreement",,,"Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Moscow 119017, Russia"
47,47,"Gooseff, MN",Jan 24 2007 ,"Relating transient storage to channel complexity in streams of varying land use in Jackson Hole, Wyoming",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Transient storage processes are important to biogeochemical cycling in many streams and depend greatly upon stream fluvial structure. Fluvial geomorphic structure establishes patterns of surface water and subsurface head distributions, often driving hyporheic exchange through steps, riffles, and meanders, and controls the potential for in-channel dead zone storage in side pools, eddies, etc. We performed stream tracer experiments and geomorphological assessments ( topographic thalweg surveys, channel dimension measurement, and sediment size analyses) in six streams in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, two agricultural streams, two urban streams, and two reference streams surrounded by native vegetation, to relate stream water transient storage to channel complexity. We propose that the inclusion of agricultural and urban streams increases the range of channel complexity and transient storage response over an assessment of numerous reaches within a single land use type. Stream tracer experiments were performed in each of the six reaches with slugs of Rhodamine WT (RWT). Downstream RWT breakthrough curves (BTCs) were simulated with a one-dimensional solute transport model, STAMMT-L, capable of simulating several transient storage residence time distribution types. As an indication of transient storage, relative BTC residence times were compared to timescale of advection, t(adv) (taken to be the time of peak tracer concentration). Reference streams were geomorphically complex, agricultural streams were intermediate, and urban streams were least complex. Urban streams had the shortest total relative residence times (< 5t(adv)) and short mean storage residence times (0.34 hour, n = 2), and reference streams consistently had the longest total relative residence times (13 - 20t(adv)) and the longest mean storage residence times (1.82 hours, n = 2). These results indicate that increased geomorphic complexity increases the potential for transient storage, likely both in the channel and in the subsurface, as demonstrated in reaches in a range of land use settings.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000243878800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW01417%26rft.atitle%3DRelating%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bto%2Bchannel%2Bcomplexity%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Bof%2Bvarying%2Bland%2Buse%2Bin%2BJackson%2BHole%252C%2BWyoming%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BN.%26rft.auinit%3DMN%26rft.aulast%3DGooseff%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2005WR004626%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO%26rft.au%3DTank%252C%2BJL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FC9hYR5ZSd06XwJ0ez5H&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2005WR004626,,"RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE FLOW,MOUNTAIN STREAMS,RETENTION,OREGON,MORPHOLOGY,REACHES",,"Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Geol & Geol Engn, 1516 Illinois St,Berthoud Hall 305D, Golden, CO 80401 USA"
48,48,"Chen, X",Sep 10 2003 ,"Stream water infiltration, bank storage, and storage zone changes due to stream-stage fluctuations",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"During a flood period, stream-stage increases induce infiltration of stream water into an aquifer; subsequent declines in stream stage cause a reverse motion of the infiltrated water. This paper presents the results of the water exchange rate between a stream and aquifer, the storage volume of the infiltrated stream water in the surrounding aquifer (bank storage), and the storage zone. The storage zone is the part of aquifer where groundwater is replaced by stream water during the flood. MODFLOW was used to simulate stream-aquifer interactions and to quantify rates of stream infiltration and return flow. MODPATH was used to trace the pathlines of the infiltrated stream water and to determine the size of the storage zone. Simulations were focused on the analyses of the effects of the stream-stage fluctuation, aquifer properties, the hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments, regional hydraulic gradients, and recharge and evapotranspiration (ET) rates on stream-aquifer interactions. Generally, for a given stream-aquifer system, larger flow rates result from larger stream-stage fluctuations; larger storage volumes and storage zones are produced by larger and longer-lasting fluctuations. For a given stream-stage hydrograph, a lower-permeable streambed, an aquitard, or an anisotropic aquifer of low vertical hydraulic conductivity can significantly reduce the rate of infiltration and limit the size of the storage zone. The bank storage solely caused by the stage fluctuation differs slightly between gaining and losing streams. Short-term rainfall recharge and ET loss in the shallow groundwater slightly influence on the flow rate, but their effects on bank storage in a larger area for a longer period can be considerable.
