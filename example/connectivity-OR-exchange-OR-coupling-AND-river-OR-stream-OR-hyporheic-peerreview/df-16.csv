0,"Ren, JH",Dec 15 2004 ,Stream-subsurface exchange of zinc in the presence of silica and kaolinite colloids,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"The mobility of sorbing contaminants in surface waters often depends strongly on associations with sediments, including both fine suspended particles and stationary bed sediments. Hydrodynamic flow coupling causes an exchange of dissolved and suspended substances between streams and underlying pore waters (hyporheic exchange). As a result, the fate of many pollutants is expected to be greatly influenced by the flux of colloids and contaminants across the stream-subsurface interface and the interactions of both types of substances with the bed sediments. Herein, we present experimental results on the stream-subsurface exchange of zinc in the presence of colloidal silica and kaolinite in a laboratory flume. We also apply a process-based theoretical model to predict the coupled transport of colloids and reactive solutes. Model input parameters were obtained using independent batch and column experiments. Zinc immobilization in the bed was found to be significantly greater in the presence of kaolinite than in the presence of colloidal silica. Model predictions indicated that there were two distinct reasons for the greater zinc immobilization in the presence of kaolinite: zinc sorbed more strongly to kaolinite than to silica, and kaolinite particles also deposited more readily in the streambed than did silica colloids. Model simulations were found to be highly dependent on the colloid size distribution. When the colloids had a bimodal distribution, colloidal-phase contaminant transport occurred primarily on the finer fraction, but bulk colloid deposition was dominated by removal of the coarser fraction.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000225761800023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStream-subsurface%2Bexchange%2Bof%2Bzinc%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bpresence%2Bof%2Bsilica%2Band%2Bkaolinite%2Bcolloids%26rft.aufirst%3DJH%26rft.auinit%3DJH%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes035090x%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D6581%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D24%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6571-6581%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6571%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Lautz, LK",Dec 15 2007 ,The effect of transient storage on nitrate uptake lengths in streams: an inter-site comparison,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Surface water-groundwater interaction in the hyporheic zone may enhance biogeochemical cycling in streams, and it has been hypothesized that streams exchanging more water with the hyporheic zone should have more rapid nitrate utilization. We used simultaneous conservative solute and nitrate addition tracer tests to measure transient storage (which includes hyporheic exchange and in-stream storage) and the rate of nitrate uptake along three reaches within the Red Canyon Creek watershed, Wyoming. We calibrated a one-dimensional transport model, incorporating transient storage (OTIS-P), to the conservative solute breakthrough curves and used the results to determine the degree of transient storage in each reach. The nitrate uptake length was quantified from the exponential decrease in nitrate concentration with distance during the tracer tests. Nitrate uptake along the most downstream reach of Red Canyon Creek was rapid (turnover time k(c)(-1) = 32 min), compared with nitrate uptake reported in other studies (k(c)(-1) = 12 to 551 min), but other sites within the watershed showed little nitrate retention or loss. The uptake length S-w-NO3- for the most downstream reach was 500 m and the mass transfer coefficient V-f-NO3- was 6.3 m min(-1). Results from 15 other nitrate-addition tracer tests were used to create a regression model relating transient storage and measures of stream flow to nitrate uptake length. The model, which includes specific discharge and transient storage area, explains almost half the variability in nitrate uptake length (adjusted R-2 = 0.44) and is most effective for comparing sites with very different stream characteristics. Although large differences in specific discharge and storage zone area explain inter-site differences in nitrate uptake, other unmeasured variables, such as available organic carbon and microbial community composition, are likely important for predicting differences in nitrate uptake between sites with similar specific discharge rates and storage zone areas, such as when making intra-site comparisons.

2,"Fang, YL",Nov 26 2020 ,High-Performance Simulation of Dynamic Hydrologic Exchange and Implications for Surrogate Flow and Reactive Transport Modeling in a Large River Corridor,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) have environmental significance in riverine ecosystems. Key river channel factors that influence the spatial and temporal variations of HEFs include river stage, riverbed morphology, and riverbed hydraulic conductivity. However, their impacts on HEFs were often evaluated independently or on small scales. In this study, we numerically evaluated the combined interactions of these factors on HEFs using a high-performance simulator, PFLOTRAN, for subsurface flow and transport. The model covers 51 square kilometers of a selected river corridor with large sinuosity along the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington, US. Three years of spatially distributed hourly river stages were applied to the riverbed. Compared to the simulation when riverbed heterogeneity is not ignored, the simulation using homogeneous riverbed conductivity underestimated HEFs, especially upwelling from lateral features, and overestimated the mean residence times derived from particle tracking. To derive a surrogate model for the river corridor, we amended the widely used transient storage model (TSM) for riverine solute study at reach scale with reactions. By treating the whole river corridor as a batch reactor, the temporal changes in the exchange rate coefficient for the TSM were derived from the dynamic residence time estimated from the hourly PFLOTRAN results. The TSM results were evaluated against the effective concentrations in the hyporheic zone calculated from the PFLOTRAN simulations. Our results show that there is potential to parameterize surrogate models such as TSM amended with biogeochemical reactions while incorporating small-scale process understandings and the signature of time-varying streamflow to advance the mechanistic understanding of river corridor processes at reach to watershed scales. However, the assumption of a well-mixed storage zone for TSM should be revisited when redox-sensitive reactions in the storage zones play important roles in river corridor functioning.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000659459900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B564211%26rft.atitle%3DHigh-Performance%2BSimulation%2Bof%2BDynamic%2BHydrologic%2BExchange%2Band%2BImplications%2Bfor%2BSurrogate%2BFlow%2Band%2BReactive%2BTransport%2BModeling%2Bin%2Ba%2BLarge%2BRiver%2BCorridor%26rft.aufirst%3DYilin%26rft.auinit%3DYL%26rft.aulast%3DFang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2020.564211%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D2%26rft.au%3DFang%252C%2BYL%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BXH%26rft.au%3DScheibe%252C%2BTD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
3,"Karadurmus, E",Apr 2004 ,Dynamic simulation and parameter estimation in river streams,ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,"Predictions and quality management issues for environmental protection in river basins rely on water-quality models. The key step in model calibration and verification is obtaining the right values of the model parameters. Current practice in model calibration is such that the reaction coefficients are adjusted by trial-and-error until the predicted values and measured data are within a pre-selected margin of error, and this may be a very time consuming task. This study is directed towards developing a parameter estimation strategy coupled with the simulation of water quality models so that the heavy burden of finding reaction rate coefficients is overcome. Dynamic mass balances for different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus, biological oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, coliforms, nonconservative constituent and algae were written for a single computational element. The model parameters conforming to those in QUAL2E water quality model were estimated by a nonlinear multi-response parameter estimation strategy coupled with a stiff integrator. Yesihrmak river basin around the city of Amasya in Turkey served as the prototype system for the model development. Samples were collected simultaneously from two stations, and concentrations of many water-quality constituents were determined either on-site or in laboratory. This dynamic data was then used for numerical parameter estimation during computer simulation. When the model was simulated with the estimated parameters, it was seen that the model was quite able to predict the dynamics of major water quality constituents. It is concluded that the proposed method shows promise for automatically generating reliable estimates of model parameters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000223168500010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDynamic%2Bsimulation%2Band%2Bparameter%2Bestimation%2Bin%2Briver%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DE%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DKaradurmus%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F09593332508618456%26rft.epage%3D479%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0959-3330%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D471-479%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D471%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DKaradurmus%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DBerber%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Guo, F",May 2016 ,Distribution and stable isotopic compositions of organic carbon in surface sediments in hyporheic zone of karst springs,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Frequently exchange of substance and energy in karst hyporheic zone may cause rapidly degeneration of groundwater environment. Hyporheic zone delineation and its nutrients exchange quantification are quite difficult in karst spring. To evaluate the source of organic matter (OM) and its environmental indication, 45 surface sediments were collected in a karst pool to determine the content of grain size, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and stable isotope. C/N ratios showed that 83 % of OM is autochthonous source, but the contribution of OM carried by surface water backflow cannot be ignored. A high C/N ratios zone could be found in the tail of the pool. This is ascribed to surface river backflowing in extremely high water level. delta C-13 of OM ranged from -29.27 to -22.40 %, and they were consistent with isotope of local hydrophyte in the spring. Combined with elemental analysis, isotopic composition, grain size distribution and human activities, detailed water environmental function zones in the pool were defined; especially, the active hyporheic zone was determined. Our data reveal that the nature and distribution of OM are complex and dynamic in a karst hyporheic zone. Organic biogeochemistry may play more important role and drive the evolution of aquatic environment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000376589500003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B850%26rft.atitle%3DDistribution%2Band%2Bstable%2Bisotopic%2Bcompositions%2Bof%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bin%2Bsurface%2Bsediments%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bkarst%2Bsprings%26rft.aufirst%3DFang%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DGuo%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-016-5672-8%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D75%26rft.au%3DGuo%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BWK%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BSY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"Leach, JA",Feb 28 2011 ,Stream temperature dynamics in two hydrogeomorphically distinct reaches,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The objective of this study was to analyse stream temperature variability during summer in relation to both surface heat exchanges and reach-scale hydrology for two hydrogeomorphically distinct reaches. The study focused on a 1.5-km wildfire-disturbed reach of Fishtrap Creek located north of Kamloops, British Columbia. Streamflow measurements and longitudinal surveys of electrical conductivity and water chemistry indicated that the upper 750 m of the study reach was dominated by flow losses. A spring discharged into the stream at 750 m below the upper reach boundary. Below the spring, the stream was neutral to losing on three measurement days, but gained flow on a fourth day that followed a rain event. Continuous stream temperature measurements typically revealed a downstream warming along the upper 750 m of the study reach on summer days, followed by a pronounced cooling associated with the spring, with little downstream change below the spring. Modelled surface energy exchanges were similar over the upper and lower sub-reaches, and thus cannot explain the differences in longitudinal temperature patterns. Application of a Lagrangian stream temperature model provided reasonably accurate predictions for the upper sub-reach. For the lower sub-reach, accurate prediction required specification of concurrent flow losses and gains as a hydrological boundary condition. These findings are consistent with differences in the hydrogeomorphology of the upper and lower sub-reaches. The modelling exercise indicated that substantial errors in predicted stream temperature can occur by representing stream-surface exchange as a reach-averaged one-directional flux computed from differences in streamflow between the upper and lower reach boundaries. Further research should focus on reliable methods for quantifying spatial variations in reach-scale hydrology.

6,"Chen, HL",Sep 1 2020 ,Extraction of connected river networks from multi-temporal remote sensing imagery using a path tracking technique,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,"Precise delineation of river networks is important for accurate hydrological and flood modelling. Whilst remote sensing (RS) has showed great potential in monitoring hydrological changes over space and time, the existing RS-based methods extract river networks based on local morphologies and seldom take into account the overall hydrological connectivity of the rivers. The existing methods also commonly neglect the effect of seasonal variation of water surfaces and the existence of temporary water bodies, which deteriorate the precision of positioning river networks. To address these challenges, a new two-stage method is developed to Extract spatiotemporal variation of water surfaces based on Multi-temporal remote sensing Imagery and Delineate connected river networks with improved accuracy (EMID method for short) using a path tracking technique. The EMID method delineates connected river networks using (a) multi-temporal imagery and a Random Forest model to synoptically map the location and extent of water surfaces under different hydrological conditions, and (b) an optimization algorithm to find the best river paths based on water-occurrence frequency. Four drainage basins with various river morphologies are considered to validate EMID. Comparing with alternative methods, the EMID method consistently produces river network results with improved accuracy in terms of stream location, river coverage and network connectivity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000537691800026,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B111868%26rft.atitle%3DExtraction%2Bof%2Bconnected%2Briver%2Bnetworks%2Bfrom%2Bmulti-temporal%2Bremote%2Bsensing%2Bimagery%2Busing%2Ba%2Bpath%2Btracking%2Btechnique%26rft.aufirst%3DHuili%26rft.auinit%3DHL%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.rse.2020.111868%26rft.eissn%3D1879-0704%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0034-4257%26rft.jtitle%3DREMOTE%2BSENSING%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DREMOTE%2BSENS%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D246%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BHL%26rft.au%3DLiang%252C%2BQH%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BTY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=REMOTE+SENSING+OF+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We present a hydrobiogeochemical model to assess how the growth of heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass affects the transport and transformation of dissolved nitrogen compounds in bed form-induced hyporheic zones. Coupling between hyporheic exchange, nitrogen metabolism, and biomass growth leads to an equilibrium between permeability reduction and microbial metabolism that yields shallow hyporheic flows in a region with low permeability and high rates of microbial metabolism near the stream-sediment interface.

8,"Gomez-Velez, JD",Dec 2015 ,Denitrification in the Mississippi River network controlled by flow through river bedforms,NATURE GEOSCIENCE,"Increasing nitrogen concentrations in the world's major rivers have led to over-fertilization of sensitive downstream waters(1-4). Flow through channel bed and bank sediments acts to remove riverine nitrogen through microbe-mediated denitrification reactions(5-10). However, little is understood about where in the channel network this biophysical process is most efficient, why certain channels are more effective nitrogen reactors, and how management practices can enhance the removal of nitrogen in regions where water circulates through sediment and mixes with groundwater-hyporheic zones(8,11,12). Here we present numerical simulations of hyporheic flow and denitrification throughout the Mississippi River network using a hydrogeomorphic model. We find that vertical exchange with sediments beneath the riverbed in hyporheic zones, driven by submerged bedforms, has denitrification potential that far exceeds lateral hyporheic exchange with sediments alongside river channels, driven by river bars and meandering banks. We propose that geomorphic differences along river corridors can explain why denitrification efficiency varies between basins in the Mississippi River network. Our findings suggest that promoting the development of permeable bedforms at the streambed-and thus vertical hyporheic exchange-would be more effective at enhancing river denitrification in large river basins than promoting lateral exchange through induced channel meandering.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000367200200017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDenitrification%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMississippi%2BRiver%2Bnetwork%2Bcontrolled%2Bby%2Bflow%2Bthrough%2Briver%2Bbedforms%26rft.aufirst%3DJesus%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DGomez-Velez%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252FNGEO2567%26rft.eissn%3D1752-0908%26rft.epage%3DU75%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1752-0894%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURE%2BGEOSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D941-U75%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D941%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BGEOSCI%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DKiel%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=NATURE+GEOSCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
9,"Nian, TK",Jun 2021 ,Numerical investigation on the evolution of landslide-induced river blocking using coupled DEM-CFD,COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS,"This paper presents a two-way coupled discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) scheme to quantitatively investigate the evolution of landslide-induced river blocking. The particle?fluid interaction is considered by exchanging interaction forces, such as drag force, buoyancy force, and lift force, which are essential for describing the evolution of river blocking. The coupled DEM-CFD scheme is first benchmarked by comparing the settling velocities of particles with different diameters with corresponding experiments. The scheme is then employed to investigate the effects of river flow velocity, river water depth, landslide velocity, and landslide volume on the evolution of river blocking. Based on the understanding of the river blocking mechanism, we propose a river blockage coefficient (Ic) to predict the river blocking. The results indicate that river water reduces the mean normal contact force of landslide particles, leading to river water quickly washing them away. The deposit velocity along the direction of the river valley is positively correlated with river water depth and river flow velocity but negatively correlated with the initial landslide velocity and landslide mass volume. The study indicates that when Ic > 1, a river is completely blocked. Otherwise, a river is unblocked or partially blocked.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000647557900006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B104101%26rft.atitle%3DNumerical%2Binvestigation%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bevolution%2Bof%2Blandslide-induced%2Briver%2Bblocking%2Busing%2Bcoupled%2BDEM-CFD%26rft.aufirst%3DTing-kai%26rft.auinit%3DTK%26rft.aulast%3DNian%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.compgeo.2021.104101%26rft.eissn%3D1873-7633%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0266-352X%26rft.jtitle%3DCOMPUTERS%2BAND%2BGEOTECHNICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DCOMPUT%2BGEOTECH%26rft.volume%3D134%26rft.au%3DNian%252C%2BTK%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BYJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=COMPUTERS+AND+GEOTECHNICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Allen, DC",Sep 2020 ,River ecosystem conceptual models and non-perennial rivers: A critical review,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Conceptual models underpin river ecosystem research. However, current models focus on continuously flowing rivers and few explicitly address characteristics such as flow cessation and drying. The applicability of existing conceptual models to nonperennial rivers that cease to flow (intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams, IRES) has not been evaluated. We reviewed 18 models, finding that they collectively describe main drivers of biogeochemical and ecological patterns and processes longitudinally (upstream-downstream), laterally (channel-riparian-floodplain), vertically (surface water-groundwater), and temporally across local and landscape scales. However, perennial rivers are longitudinally continuous while IRES are longitudinally discontinuous. Whereas perennial rivers have bidirectional lateral connections between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, in IRES, this connection is unidirectional for much of the time, from terrestrial-to-aquatic only. Vertical connectivity between surface and subsurface water occurs bidirectionally and is temporally consistent in perennial rivers. However, in IRES, this exchange is temporally variable, and can become unidirectional during drying or rewetting phases. Finally, drying adds another dimension of flow variation to be considered across temporal and spatial scales in IRES, much as flooding is considered as a temporally and spatially dynamic process in perennial rivers. Here, we focus on ways in which existing models could be modified to accommodate drying as a fundamental process that can alter these patterns and processes across spatial and temporal dimensions in streams. This perspective is needed to support river science and management in our era of rapid global change, including increasing duration, frequency, and occurrence of drying.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000567408700005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be1473%26rft.atitle%3DRiver%2Becosystem%2Bconceptual%2Bmodels%2Band%2Bnon-perennial%2Brivers%253A%2BA%2Bcritical%2Breview%26rft.aufirst%3DDaniel%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DDC%26rft.aulast%3DAllen%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwat2.1473%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2049-1948%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWILEY%2BINTERDISCIPLINARY%2BREVIEWS-WATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWIRES%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DAllen%252C%2BDC%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DZimmer%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=WILEY+INTERDISCIPLINARY+REVIEWS-WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

To celebrate this anniversary, it has now been translated into English and republished in Fundamental and Applied Limnology, the successor to Archiv fur Hydrobiologie, as part of this special issue on hyporheic zone ecology. Here we examine the development and current state of knowledge of four aspects of hyporheic zone ecology first articulated by Orghidan. First, we consider the ecotonal nature of the hyporheic zone (HZ) and its relationship to the wider stream ecosystem; second, surface water and groundwater habitat interconnectivity within the hyporheic zone; third, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the HZ and how this may influence its function as a refugium for taxa during disturbances; and lastly interactions between hyporheic invertebrates and pore water volume, bacterial densities and particulate organic carbon. We outline the characteristics of the hyporheic zone that may determine how effective it will be as a refugium for benthic taxa during disturbances and consider the biological traits of benthic species most able to utilise the HZ as a refugium. Finally, we examine an important avenue of research that has developed since Orghidans paper reflecting significant scientific and technological advances; the role of the hyporheic zone in stream nutrient dynamics.

We use the expression nutrient dynamics for Studies that Included some measures of biological processes occurring within streams Prior to the 1970s, instream biological processes were little studied, but through 1985 conceptual advances were made, and 4 types of studies made important contributions to Our understanding of instream processes 1) evidence of increased plant production and decomposition in response to nutrient addition, 2) studies showing a downstream decrease in nutrient concentrations, 3) studies using radioisotopes, and 4) budget studies Beginning with the first paper printed in its first Issue, J-NABS has been the outlet for key papers advancing our understanding of rates and controls of nutrient dynamics in streams. In the first few years, an important review and a conceptual model for conducting experiments to study nutrient dynamics in streams were published in J-NABS In the 1990s, J-NABS published a number of papers on nutrient recycling within algal communities, the role of the hyporheic zone, the role of spawning fish, and the coupling of data from field N-15 additions and a N-cycling model to provide a synoptic view of N dynamics in streams Since 2000, J-NABS has published influential studies on nutrient criteria for streams, rates of and controls on nitrification and denitrification, uptake of stream nutrients by riparian vegetation, and nutrient dynamics in urban streams Nutrient dynamics will certainly continue to be an important topic in J-NABS Topics needing further study include. techniques for study in nutrient dynamics, nutrient dynamics in larger streams and rivers, the ultimate fate of nutrients taken up by plants and microbes in streams, ecological stoichiometry, the effects of climate change, and the role of streams and rivers in nutrient transformation and retention at the landscape scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000275023500007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNutrient%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Band%2Bthe%2Brole%2Bof%2BJ-NABS%26rft.aufirst%3DPatrick%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DPJ%26rft.aulast%3DMulholland%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F08-035.1%26rft.epage%3D117%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D100-117%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D100%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DMulholland%252C%2BPJ%26rft.au%3DWebster%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
14,"Marzadri, A",Jul 24 2010 ,Semianalytical analysis of hyporheic flow induced by alternate bars,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We investigate the effects of alternate bar morphology on the hyporheic flow in gravel bed rivers. Our goal is to investigate the relations between residence time distribution of a conservative tracer and the parameters controlling bed form morphology. We assume homogeneous, isotropic or anisotropic hydraulic properties of the streambed sediment and constant flow regime in equilibrium with the bed form, which is considered fixed because its formation timescale is much longer than that of the subsurface flow. Under these assumptions, we solve the in-stream and hyporheic flow fields analytically in a three-dimensional domain. We approximate the former with the shallow water equations and model the latter as a Darcian flow. The two systems are linked through the hydraulic head distribution, which is predicted at the streambed by the surface model and applied as a boundary condition to the hyporheic flow model. We solve the solute transport equation in the hyporheic zone for a conservative tracer by means of particle tracking. Our model predicts that the mean value and variance of the hyporheic residence time depend on the alternate bar amplitude at equilibrium. This result is found to be applicable also to discharges that are lower (70% in our simulations) than the formative and submerge the bars entirely. Moreover, our analysis shows that 95% of the hyporheic flow is confined in a near-bed layer, whose depth is about the width of the channel and shallows from low to steep gradient streams. This causes the hyporheic mean residence time to reach a threshold when the alluvial depth is deeper than the channel width. Our results also show that as the stream slope increases, the streamlines compact near to the streambed, thereby reducing the mean residence time and its variance. Finally, we observe that the hyporheic residence time of pulse injections of passive solutes is lognormally distributed, with the mean value depending in a simple manner on the amplitude of the alternate bars.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000280340200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW07531%26rft.atitle%3DSemianalytical%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Binduced%2Bby%2Balternate%2Bbars%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarzadri%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009WR008285%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DMarzadri%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DTubino%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

16,"McKnight, DM",Jan 2002 ,In-stream sorption of fulvic acid in an acidic stream: A stream-scale transport experiment,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] The variation of concentration and composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream waters cannot be explained solely on the basis of soil processes in contributing subcatchments. To investigate in-stream processes that control DOC, we injected DOC-enriched water into a reach of the Snake River (Summit County, Colorado) that has abundant iron oxyhydroxides coating the streambed. The injected water was obtained from the Suwannee River (Georgia), which is highly enriched in fulvic acid. The fulvic acid from this water is the standard reference for aquatic fulvic acid for the International Humic Substances Society and has been well characterized. During the experimental injection, significant removal of sorbable fulvic acid occurred within the first 141 m of stream reach. We coinjected a conservative tracer (lithium chloride) and analyzed the results with the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) stream solute transport model to quantify the physical transport mechanisms. The downstream transport of fulvic acid as indicated by absorbance was then simulated using OTIS with a first-order kinetic sorption rate constant applied to the sorbable fulvic acid. The ""sorbable"" fraction of injected fulvic acid was irreversibly sorbed by streambed sediments at rates (kinetic rate constants) of the order of 10(-4)-10(-3) s(-1). In the injected Suwannee River water, sorbable and nonsorbable fulvic acid had distinct chemical characteristics identified in C-13-NMR spectra. The C-13-NMR spectra indicate that during the experiment, the sorbable ""signal"" of greater aromaticity and carboxyl content decreased downstream; that is, these components were preferentially removed. This study illustrates that interactions between the water and the reactive surfaces will modify significantly the concentration and composition of DOC observed in streams with abundant chemically reactive surfaces on the streambed and in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000176039700006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1005%26rft.atitle%3DIn-stream%2Bsorption%2Bof%2Bfulvic%2Bacid%2Bin%2Ban%2Bacidic%2Bstream%253A%2BA%2Bstream-scale%2Btransport%2Bexperiment%26rft.aufirst%3DDM%26rft.auinit%3DDM%26rft.aulast%3DMcKnight%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2001WR000269%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DHornberger%252C%2BGM%26rft.au%3DBoyer%252C%2BEW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"Zheng, LZ",Aug 2019 ,Ripple Effects: Bed Form Morphodynamics Cascading Into Hyporheic Zone Biogeochemistry,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The water quality and ecosystem health of river corridors depend on the biogeochemical processes occurring in the hyporheic zones (HZs) of the beds and banks of rivers. HZs in riverbeds often form because of bed forms. Despite widespread and persistent variation in river flow, how the discharge- and grain size-dependent geometry of bed forms and how bed form migration collectively and systematically affects hyporheic exchange flux, solute transport, and biogeochemical reaction rates are unknown. We investigated these linked processes through morphodynamically consistent multiphysics numerical simulation experiments. Several realistic ripple geometries based on bed form stability criteria using mean river flow velocity and median sediment grain size were designed. Ripple migration rates were estimated based primarily on the river velocity. The ripple geometries and migration rates were used to drive hyporheic flow and reactive transport models which quantified HZ nitrogen transformation. Results from fixed bed form simulations were compared with matching migrating bed form scenarios. We found that the turnover exchange due to ripple migration has a large impact on reactant supply and reaction rates. The nitrate removal efficiency increased asymptotically with Damkohler number for both mobile and immobile ripples, but the immobile ripple always had a higher nitrate removal efficiency. Since moving ripples remove less nitrogen, and may even be net nitrifying at times, consideration for bed form morphodynamics may therefore lead to reduction of model-based estimates of denitrification. The connection between nitrate removal efficiency and Damkohler number can be integrated into frameworks for quantifying transient, network-scale, HZ nitrate dynamics.Plain Language Summary Sandy riverbeds are very rarely flat. They are typically covered by ripples and dunes. Because of their topography, these ripples and dunes drive variations in water pressure across their surfaces due to deflection, acceleration, and deceleration of the river flow. These pressure variations drive river water to infiltrate into the porous and permeable sediment where pressure is high and exit from the sediment where it is low. This pressure-driven flow, called hyporheic exchange, is critical to the water quality of rivers since it allows river water to undergo biogeochemical reactions that take place within the sediment. Ripples are highly dynamic however and respond readily to changes in river flow. How the migration and variable shape of ripples affect hyporheic exchange and the biogeochemical reactions it dictates is poorly understood and seldom studied. Here we bring concepts from ripple dynamics, river and groundwater hydraulics, and biogeochemistry into a unified modeling framework. The modeling was used to assess the effects of ripple migration on hyporheic zone biogeochemistry. We found that migrating ripples generally process less nitrate, a widespread pollutant, compared to their stationary counterparts. Thus, investigations and applications of hyporheic zone biogeochemical processes should pay attention to the dynamics of ripples.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000490973700054,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRipple%2BEffects%253A%2BBed%2BForm%2BMorphodynamics%2BCascading%2BInto%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BBiogeochemistry%26rft.aufirst%3DLizhi%26rft.auinit%3DLZ%26rft.aulast%3DZheng%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR023517%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7342%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7320-7342%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7320%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DZheng%252C%2BLZ%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DMohrig%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
18,"Voltz, T",Jun 2013 ,Riparian hydraulic gradient and stream-groundwater exchange dynamics in steep headwater valleys,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE,"Patterns of riparian hydraulic gradients and stream-groundwater exchange in headwater catchments provide the hydrologic context for important ecological processes. Although the controls are relatively well understood, their dynamics during periods of hydrologic change is not. We investigate riparian hydraulic gradients over three different time scales in two steep, forested, headwater catchments in Oregon (WS01 and WS03) to determine the potential controls of reach-scale valley slope and cross-sectional valley geometry. Groundwater and stream stage data collected at high spatial and temporal resolutions over a period encompassing a 1.25 year storm and subsequent seasonal baseflow recession indicate that hydraulic gradients in both riparian aquifers exhibit strong persistence of down-valley dominance. Responses to rainfall do not support the simple conceptual models of increased riparian hydraulic gradient toward streams. Hydraulic gradient response in WS01 to both the seasonal baseflow recession and the storm suggested the potential for increased stream-groundwater exchange, but there was less evidence for this in WS03. Results from four constant-rate tracer injections in each stream showed a high baseline level of exchange overall, and both a slight seasonal increase (WS01) and slight decrease (WS03) in the riparian intrusion of tracer-labeled stream water as stream discharge receded. These results indicate that steep headwater valley floors host extensive stream water exchange and very little change in the water table gradients over 3 orders of magnitude of stream discharge.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000324993900039,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiparian%2Bhydraulic%2Bgradient%2Band%2Bstream-groundwater%2Bexchange%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bsteep%2Bheadwater%2Bvalleys%26rft.aufirst%3DThomas%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DVoltz%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fjgrf.20074%26rft.epage%3D969%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9003%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-EARTH%2BSURFACE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D953-969%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D953%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-EARTH%26rft.volume%3D118%26rft.au%3DVoltz%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DWagener%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-EARTH+SURFACE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Endreny, T",Feb 12 2011 ,Hyporheic flow path response to hydraulic jumps at river steps: Hydrostatic model simulations,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"This research examined hydrostatic groundwater model (MODFLOW) predictive adequacy and sensitivity in simulating hyporheic flow paths across a river step with a hydraulic jump. In a companion paper, we used flume and hydrodynamic model analysis to develop a refined conceptual model depicting these flow paths with zones of downwelling and upstream-directed flux below the step. The previous coarse conceptual model predicted uniform downstream-directed upwelling below the step. The hydrostatic model accurately predicted the downwelling and upstream-directed fluxes beneath the wave and jump but failed to predict the plunge pool downwelling, which is driven by dynamic pressures. Sensitivity tests varied riverbed topography and water surface profile geometry for a river with 1% slopes, 10 cm flow depths, and 50-150 cm long jets and jumps. The flow paths below the jet-jump region were driven by hydrostatic pressures and were highly sensitive to water surface profile and riverbed topography parameters. Failure to simulate the hydraulic jump caused errors in hyporheic flow path predictions beneath the jump region (similar to 1 m long by similar to 0.5 m deep). If the jump was poorly parameterized, several meters of riverbed flow paths could be erroneously modeled as pointing upstream. The hyporheic zone may contain a spatial mosaic of aerobic and anaerobic waters regulating nutrient transformations and biologic productivity. Accurate parameterization of hydraulic jumps in hyporheic simulation has the potential to improve predictions and explain heterogeneous subsurface flow paths and associated nutrient patterns and ecosystem functions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000287327200002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW02518%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bflow%2Bpath%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Bhydraulic%2Bjumps%2Bat%2Briver%2Bsteps%253A%2BHydrostatic%2Bmodel%2Bsimulations%26rft.aufirst%3DT.%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DEndreny%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR010014%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DLautz%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DSiegel%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Marmonier, P",Mar 2010 ,Relevance of large litter bag burial for the study of leaf breakdown in the hyporheic zone,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Particulate organic matter is the major source of energy for most low-order streams, but a large part of this litter is buried within bed sediment during floods and thus become poorly available for benthic food webs. The fate of this buried litter is little studied. In most cases, measures of breakdown rates consist of burying a known mass of litter within the stream sediment and following its breakdown over time. We tested this method using large litter bags (15 x 15 cm) and two field experiments. First, we used litter large bags filled with Alnus glutinosa leaves (buried at 20 cm depth with a shovel) in six stations within different land-use contexts and with different sediment grain sizes. Breakdown rates were surprisingly high (0.0011-0.0188 day(-1)) and neither correlate with most of the physico-chemical characteristics measured in the interstitial habitats nor with the land-use around the stream. In contrast, the rates were negatively correlated with a decrease in oxygen concentrations between surface and buried bags and positively correlated with both the percentage of coarse particles (20-40 mm) in the sediment and benthic macro-invertebrate richness. These results suggest that the vertical exchanges with surface water in the hyporheic zone play a crucial role in litter breakdown. Second, an experimental modification of local sediment (removing fine particles with a shovel to increase vertical exchanges) highlighted the influence of grain size on water and oxygen exchanges, but had no effect on hyporheic breakdown rates. Burying large litter bags within sediments may thus not be a relevant method, especially in clogged conditions, due to changes induced through the burial process in the vertical connectivity between surface and interstitial habitats that modify organic matter processing.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000274317600016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRelevance%2Bof%2Blarge%2Blitter%2Bbag%2Bburial%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bstudy%2Bof%2Bleaf%2Bbreakdown%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DPierre%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DMarmonier%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-009-0082-5%26rft.epage%3D214%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D203-214%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D203%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D641%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DPiscart%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DChauvet%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Neilson, BT",Sep 30 2009 ,Data collection methodology for dynamic temperature model testing and corroboration,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This article describes a data collection approach for determining the significance of individual heat fluxes within streams with an emphasis on testing (i.e. identification of possible missing heat fluxes), development, calibration and corroboration of a dynamic temperature model. The basis for developing this approach was a preliminary temperature modelling effort on the Virgin River in southwestern Utah during a low-flow period that suggested important components of the energy balance might be missing in the original standard surface-flux temperature model. Possible missing heat fluxes were identified as bed conduction, hyporheic exchange, dead zone warming and exchange and poor representation of the amount of solar radiation entering the water column. To identify and estimate the relative importance of the missing components, a comprehensive data collection effort was developed and implemented. In particular, a method for measuring shortwave radiation behaviour in the water column and an in situ method for separating out bed conduction and hyporheic influences were established. The resulting data and subsequent modelling effort indicate that hyporheic and dead zone heat fluxes are important, whereas solar radiation reflection at the water surface was found to be insignificant. Although bed conduction can be significant in certain rivers, it was found to have little effect on the overall heat budget for this section of the Virgin River.

Nowadays, information systems produce streaming event logs to record their huge processes. The truncated streaming event log is a big issue in process discovery because it inflicts incomplete traces that make process discovery depict wrong processes in a process model. Earlier research suggested several methods for recovering the truncated streaming event log and none of them utilized Coupled Hidden Markov Model. This research proposes a method that combines Coupled Hidden Markov Model with Double States and the Modification of Viterbi-Backward method for recovering the truncated streaming event log. The first layer of states contains the transition probability of activities. The second layer of states uses patterns for detecting traces which have a low appearance in the event log. The experiment results showed that the proposed method recovered appropriately the truncated streaming event log.

23,"Liang, XY",Mar 2018 ,Spatiotemporal Responses of Groundwater Flow and Aquifer-River Exchanges to Flood Events,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Rapidly rising river stages induced by flood events lead to considerable river water infiltration into aquifers and carry surface-borne solutes into hyporheic zones which are widely recognized as an important place for the biogeochemical activity. Existing studies for surface-groundwater exchanges induced by flood events usually limit to a river-aquifer cross section that is perpendicular to river channels, and neglect groundwater flow in parallel with river channels. In this study, surface-groundwater exchanges to a flood event are investigated with specific considerations of unconfined flow in direction that is in parallel with river channels. The groundwater flow is described by a two-dimensional Boussinesq equation and the flood event is described by a diffusive-type flood wave. Analytical solutions are derived and tested using the numerical solution. The results indicate that river water infiltrates into aquifers quickly during flood events, and mostly returns to the river within a short period of time after the flood event. However, the rest river water will stay in aquifers for a long period of time. The residual river water not only flows back to rivers but also flows to downstream aquifers. The one-dimensional model of neglecting flow in the direction parallel with river channels will overestimate heads and discharge in upstream aquifers. The return flow induced by the flood event has a power law form with time and has a significant impact on the base flow recession at early times. The solution can match the observed hydraulic heads in riparian zone wells of Iowa during flood events.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000430364900006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2BResponses%2Bof%2BGroundwater%2BFlow%2Band%2BAquifer-River%2BExchanges%2Bto%2BFlood%2BEvents%26rft.aufirst%3DXiuyu%26rft.auinit%3DXY%26rft.aulast%3DLiang%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR022046%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1532%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1513-1532%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1513%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DLiang%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DZhan%252C%2BHB%26rft.au%3DSchilling%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
24,"Wang, ZH",Dec 2016 ,"An integrated model coupling open-channel flow, turbidity current and flow exchanges between main river and tributaries in Xiaolangdi Reservoir, China",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The ever growing importance of sustainable management of reservoir sedimentation has promoted the development and applications of turbidity current models. However, there are few effective and practical models in literature for turbidity currents in a reservoir where the impounded area involves both the main river and its many tributaries. An integrated numerical model coupling open-channel flow, turbidity current and flow exchanges between main river and tributaries is proposed, which can simulate the complex flow and sediment transport in a reservoir where these three physical processes coexist. The model consists of two sets of governing equations for the open-channel flow and turbidity current, which are based on the modified St. Venant equations by taking into account the effect of lateral flow exchanges. These two sets of equations are solved in the finite volume method framework and the solutions are executed in an alternating calculation mode. Different methods are respectively proposed to calculate the discharge of flow exchange caused by free surface gradient and turbidity current intrusion. For the surface-gradient driven flow exchange, a storage cell method, which re-defines the relationship between water level and representative cross-sectional area, is used to update the water level at confluence. For the turbidity current intrusion, a discharge formula is proposed based on the analysis of the energy and momentum transformation in the intruding turbid water body. This formula differs from previous ones in that the effect of tributary bed slope is considered. Two events of water-sediment regulation conducted in the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in 2004 and 2006 were simulated to test the ability of this model. The predicted reservoir drawdown process, the turbidity current evolution and the sediment venting efficiency were in close agreement with the measurements. The necessity to couple the flow exchanges was demonstrated by comparing the performance of the proposed model with different intrusion discharge formulas and the common one-dimensional model neglecting the main river and tributary interaction.

25,"Marmonier, P",May 2004 ,A simple technique using wooden stakes to estimate vertical patterns of interstitial oxygenation in the beds of rivers,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Silt and fine sediments from anthropogenic activities frequently clog river bed sediments, impairing vertical exchanges between stream and subsurface water. River managers need a simple technique to detect the extent of interstitial clogging and monitor the effectiveness of measures to reduce siltation. We evaluated the use of 30 cm long pine-wood stakes, inserted for 3-6 weeks in the sediments of four French rivers varying in interstitial clogging, to determine the association between changes in the colour of the wood and the adjacent interstitial conditions. There was a general association between depth to interstitial hypoxia and location of the colour change of the wooden stakes from brown to pale grey or black after 3-4 weeks. This change in colour also broadly matched interstitial contents of fine sediment, ammonium, and nitrate although the method could not reliably detect microscale zones of anoxia or short-term changes in dissolved oxygen. Thus, its effectiveness lies in its use as a cheap, simple, and broad-scale indicator for collecting long-term integrated data of interstitial oxygenation in stream sediments with minimal disruption of the gravel bed, and appears an ideal tool for river managers and salmonid fish biologists.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000221450000009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bsimple%2Btechnique%2Busing%2Bwooden%2Bstakes%2Bto%2Bestimate%2Bvertical%2Bpatterns%2Bof%2Binterstitial%2Boxygenation%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bbeds%2Bof%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DP%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DMarmonier%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F0003-9136%252F2004%252F0160-0133%26rft.epage%3D143%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D133-143%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D133%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D160%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DDelettre%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
26,"Yao, YY",Aug 2015 ,Spatiotemporal variation of river temperature as a predictor of groundwater/surface-water interactions in an arid watershed in China,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Interactions between groundwater and surface water in arid regions are complex, and recharge-discharge processes are often influenced by the hydrological regime, climate and geology. Traditional methods such as hydraulic gradient measuring by piezometers, differential discharge gauging and conservative tracer experiments, are often inadequate to capture the spatial and temporal variation of exchange rates. In this study, the distribution and the size of the overall groundwater inflow zone (GIZ) and the hyporheic inflow zone (HIZ) in the middle Heihe River Basin, northwest China, are characterized, and the relative inflow flux is estimated by high-resolution temperature measurements. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) was used to measure the mixing temperatures of a 5-km reach of streambed with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. The sampling interval was 0.25 m, and the temporal interval was 15 and 10 min at Pingchuan and Banqiao experimental sites, respectively. Two separate measurement periods in Pingchuan (Ping1, Ping2) captured different meteorological and stream-flow conditions. The results show that the number and the size range of the individual HIZs are greater than those of GIZs. Groundwater upwelling (GIZ) causes a larger decrease in river-water temperature with less inflow flux compared with the HIZ. The distribution pattern of HIZs and GIZs is influenced by the hydrodynamics of the river and the hydraulic permeability of the riverbed. High-resolution temperature variation based on DTS is an effective predictor of distributed inflows from groundwater upwelling and hyporheic exchange in an arid region.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000358291000013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2Bvariation%2Bof%2Briver%2Btemperature%2Bas%2Ba%2Bpredictor%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%252Fsurface-water%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Ban%2Barid%2Bwatershed%2Bin%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DYingying%26rft.auinit%3DYY%26rft.aulast%3DYao%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-015-1265-y%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D1007%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D999-1007%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D999%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DYao%252C%2BYY%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BCK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"He, WL",Jun 2022 ,Using eDNA to assess the fish diversity and spatial characteristics in the Changjiang River-Shijiu Lake connected system,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"With the decrease in biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems, the monitoring of fish has become a current research hotspot. The eDNA-based method has been applied to a variety of single-type water systems (i.e., rivers, lakes, or oceans), but it has not been applied to river-lake-connected systems. We collected eDNA from water samples from the Changjiang River-Shijiu Lake connected system (including the lake area, river channel, and river section) and discussed the fish diversity characteristics of the connected system. A total of 180 samples were collected, and the fish community was analyzed using eDNA metabarcoding of the mitochondrial 12 s region. We finally identified 66 taxa of fish, including one at the order level, two at the family level, 9 at the subfamily level, 20 at the genus level, and 34 annotated to the species level. The number of fish species in the river-lake connected system was greater than that in a single-type water system. The lake area, river channel, and river section had a high degree of overlap in fish composition, and the maximum number of fish was in the river section. There was no significant difference in alpha diversity index among the three types of waters, but there were significant differences in fish relative abundance, which was dominated by different species. The distribution of three migratory fish (Elopichthys bambusa, Ctenopharyngodon idella, and Hypophthalmichthyinae sp.) accorded with the unique life history migration strategy in the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang River. Our results provide detailed data on fish diversity and have important implications for the long-term management and conservation of river-lake connected systems in the lower reaches of the Changjiang River. Our research further proves that eDNA can be used to monitor the biodiversity of river-lake connected systems and reflect their spatial characteristics. As a continuously explored method, eDNA shows great potential in the study of fish diversity in river-lake systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000805241400007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B108968%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2BeDNA%2Bto%2Bassess%2Bthe%2Bfish%2Bdiversity%2Band%2Bspatial%2Bcharacteristics%2Bin%2Bthe%2BChangjiang%2BRiver-Shijiu%2BLake%2Bconnected%2Bsystem%26rft.aufirst%3DWanlu%26rft.auinit%3DWL%26rft.aulast%3DHe%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecolind.2022.108968%26rft.eissn%3D1872-7034%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1470-160X%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BINDICATORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BINDIC%26rft.volume%3D139%26rft.au%3DHe%252C%2BWL%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BDP%26rft.au%3DFang%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+INDICATORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The use of fibre optic distributed temperature sensing at the sediment-water interface in a small sand-bed stream identifies such temperature patterns. Groundwater and interflow can be differentiated based on the temporal evolution of temperature patterns. Additionally, sudden temperature changes at the sediment-water interface observed during the transit of floods enable spatial identification of local up and downwelling. Electromagnetic induction geophysics can detect subsurface texture structures that support groundwater-surface water exchange. Our results show that areas of permanent temperature anomalies observed with fibre optic distributed temperature sensing match areas of comparatively homogeneous electrical conductivity.

When a solid is compressed, its deformation will cause the liquid in the internal pores to flow, resulting in a streaming potential. In this study, we have developed a model composed of a solid thick-walled cylinder and a liquid in its inner hole at the micro-nano scale. When the solid is subjected to uniform pressure the liquid flow velocity distribution in the through hole or tube can be obtained by solid-liquid coupling. A streaming potential equation induced from solid-liquid coupling is established. The solution results of the equation show that the streaming potential is proportional to the derivative of the pressure with respect to time and proportional to the square of the length of the tube. The solution can be degenerated to classical streaming potential relationships by disregarding the influence of solid deformation on the streaming, which demonstrates the validity of the solution.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000861336600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B129913%26rft.atitle%3DStreaming%2Bpotential%2Binduced%2Bfrom%2Bsolid-liquid%2Bcoupling%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bmicro-nano%2Bscale%26rft.aufirst%3DShaozhe%26rft.auinit%3DSZ%26rft.aulast%3DPan%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.colsurfa.2022.129913%26rft.eissn%3D1873-4359%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0927-7757%26rft.jtitle%3DCOLLOIDS%2BAND%2BSURFACES%2BA-PHYSICOCHEMICAL%2BAND%2BENGINEERING%2BASPECTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DCOLLOID%2BSURFACE%2BA%26rft.volume%3D653%26rft.au%3DPan%252C%2BSZ%26rft.au%3DHou%252C%2BZD%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BJZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=COLLOIDS+AND+SURFACES+A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL+AND+ENGINEERING+ASPECTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Eighteen genera were recorded and 13 morphological traits were identified. The results indicate that the distribution patterns of hyporheic chironomid taxa vary according to depth and microhabitat. Spatial preferences for riffles habitats are evident, and the vertical distribution is correlated with morphological traits like body size, pseudopods and mentum.

The results show that the density gradient can change the flow of pore water and the strong density-driven flow can lead to an unstable flow, which increases the effect of preferential flow and thus causes the appearance of solute fingers in the hyporheic zone. Notably, these solute fingers become more obvious with the increase of depth. The appearance of solute fingers depends on the relative strength of the pumping exchange and density gradient, which are represented by the dimensionless number M* and N* respectively. Finger flows appear near the interface when M* is less than 0.5 N*.

32,"Kim, C",Jan 1 2018 ,Semi-continuous capacitive deionization using multi-channel flow stream and ion exchange membranes,DESALINATION,"Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a promising desalination process, but conventional static electrode CDI operates by sequentially cycling through charging and discharging to produce fresh and concentrated water, respectively. However, an effective continuous operation is desirable for optimized system operation. Here, we report a semi continuous desalination process with a novel modified CDI cell architecture using a multi-channel flow stream and ion exchange membranes (MC-MCDI). This MC-MCDI consists of two channels including side and middle channels with a pair of cation and anion ion exchange membranes where the feed streams can be separately distributed without mixing. The MC-MCDI design allows semi-continuous production of clean water since the separated middle and side channels are alternately desalinated and regenerated: one channel is being desalinated while the other channel is regenerated. Therefore, the cell can produce clean water during both charging and discharging, enabling semi-continuous operation. In addition, with the benefit from similar cell configuration with membrane CDI, the MC-MCDI design exhibits a high salt adsorption capacity (SAC) of 22 +/- 2 mg/g and charge efficiency of 90 +/- 2% at middle and side channels during charging and discharging with reverse voltage operation (cell voltage of + 1.2 V vs.- 1.2 V).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000414890300010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSemi-continuous%2Bcapacitive%2Bdeionization%2Busing%2Bmulti-channel%2Bflow%2Bstream%2Band%2Bion%2Bexchange%2Bmembranes%26rft.aufirst%3DChoonsoo%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DKim%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.desal.2017.10.012%26rft.eissn%3D1873-4464%26rft.epage%3D110%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0011-9164%26rft.jtitle%3DDESALINATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D104-110%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D104%26rft.stitle%3DDESALINATION%26rft.volume%3D425%26rft.au%3DKim%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DSrimuk%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DPresser%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=DESALINATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

It is needed to develop sound plans for sustainable use of the groundwater with minimal undesirable effects. This article reports an investigation of the component (module) that describes the stream-aquifer flow exchange in several groundwater simulators. The study indicates that the module may not have a solid physical basis when used in large-scale regional studies to estimate the stream-aquifer flow exchange. The component relies upon an empirical parameter known as the leakance coefficient. It is demonstrated that neglecting river penetration of the aquifer can lead to non-negligible errors in estimation of seepage. In addition the leakance coefficient (dimension inverse of a time) is not constant in time but varies with the conditions in the river and in the surrounding aquifer. A potential, practical and simple alternative is presented.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000445316200070,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAchilles%2527%2Bheel%2Bof%2Bintegrated%2Bhydrologic%2Bmodels%253A%2BThe%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bflow%2Bexchange%252C%2Band%2Bproposed%2Balternative%26rft.aufirst%3DHubert%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DHJ%26rft.aulast%3DMorel-Seytoux%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2018.07.010%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.epage%3D908%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D900-908%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D900%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D564%26rft.au%3DMorel-Seytoux%252C%2BHJ%26rft.au%3DMiller%252C%2BCD%26rft.au%3DMiracapillo%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

They possess an extremely efficient nutrient entrapment mechanism which is widely believed to be mediated through ion exchange processes.  During a field experiment, potassium and bromide were transported along a 105 m reach at different rates.  The distance between the two solute pulses increased with increasing distance downstream.  And, in a laboratory experiment, changing the ionic composition of waters overlying the biofilm influenced the retention of (phenolic) material by that biofilm.  An analogy was drawn with ion chromatography (IC):  In IC, different ions show different rates of progress through the column (retention times), and also show increasing separation between peaks with increasing distance from the point of injection (column length).  Likewise, the affinity of a given ion for the column can be modified by manipulation of the ionic composition of overlying waters (eluent).  The observed similarities between IC columns and the biofilm-coated stream channel may therefore represent a degree of experimental support for the putative involvement of ion exchange in the biofilm nutrient entrapment mechanism.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1995QH99200007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DION-EXCHANGE%2BMECHANISMS%2BAND%2BTHE%2BENTRAPMENT%2BOF%2BNUTRIENTS%2BBY%2BRIVER%2BBIOFILMS%26rft.aufirst%3DC%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DFREEMAN%26rft.date%3D1995%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00033502%26rft.epage%3D65%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D61-65%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D61%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D297%26rft.au%3DFREEMAN%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DCHAPMAN%252C%2BPJ%26rft.au%3DWHEATER%252C%2BHS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The burial of large bags (15 x 15 cm) used in the benthic layer generates disturbances of the vertical connectivity with surface water, and thus affects the breakdown rate. We performed field and laboratory experiments to test the suitability of two leaf litter containers: small litter bags (5 x 4 cm) and perforated stainless steel cylinders (6 cm long, 1.6 cm in diameter), both introduced inside sediments using mobile mini-piezometers (1 m long, 1.7 cm or 3 cm in diameter). We compared the two containers for (i) the hydrological exchanges toward leaf litter, (ii) the impact of a benthic shredder on leaf breakdown, and (iii) the response of leaf litter breakdown to changes in sediment characteristics. The two methods give similar patterns of breakdown rates with stream sediment characteristics, but the use of perforated stainless steel cylinders provides an artificial empty volume in which invertebrates can over degrade leaf litter. Small plastic bags do not alter physico-chemical conditions around leaf litter and give lower values of breakdown rates in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000312073300025,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNew%2Bmethods%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Binvestigation%2Bof%2Bleaf%2Blitter%2Bbreakdown%2Bin%2Briver%2Bsediments%26rft.aufirst%3DSimon%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DNavel%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-012-1239-1%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D312%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D301-312%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D301%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D700%26rft.au%3DNavel%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DPiscart%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The influence was quantified using a numerical model of the hyporheic zone. The model included open-framework gravel stratasets represented with commonly observed characteristics including a volume fraction of about one-third of the streambed sediment, a hydraulic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than other strata present, and a spatial connectivity forming preferential-flow pathways. The influence of open-framework gravel stratasets on hyporheic flow was much greater than the influence of the channel morphology including meanders, point bars, dunes, and ripples. Seventy percent of the total hyporheic exchange occurred across 30% of the channel boundary at locations of open-framework gravel stratasets. The maximum local interfacial flux rates occurred at these locations, and were orders of magnitude greater than those at other locations. The local flux rates varied by six orders of magnitude over the channel boundary. The composite flow rate through the model with open-framework gravel stratsets was an order of magnitude greater than that through an equivalent but homogeneous model.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000347978200007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BInfluence%2Bof%2BStreambed%2BHeterogeneity%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2Bin%2BGravelly%2BRivers%26rft.aufirst%3DYaoQuan%26rft.auinit%3DYQ%26rft.aulast%3DZhou%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12048%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D216%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D206-216%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D206%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BYQ%26rft.au%3DRitzi%252C%2BRW%26rft.au%3DDominic%252C%2BDF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
37,"Dudley-Southern, M",Feb 2015 ,Temporal responses of groundwater-surface water exchange to successive storm events,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Groundwater-surface water exchange within the hyporheic zone is widely recognized as a key mechanism controlling the fate of nutrients within catchments. In gaining river systems, groundwater-surface water interactions are constrained by upwelling groundwater but there is increasing evidence that a rapid rise in river stage during storm events can result in a temporary reversal of vertical hydraulic gradients, leading to surface water infiltration into the subsurface and supply of surface-borne reactive solutes to this biogeochemically active interface. At a UK study site, using logged hydraulic heads in the surface water, riverbed, and riverbanks and logged electrical conductivity at multiple depths in the riverbed we show that storm events can lead to a temporary reversal of vertical hydraulic gradient with mixing evident up to 30 cm beneath the riverbed. Cross-channel variability is evident, with the center of the channel consistently having shorter reversals of hydraulic gradient, compared to the channel margins. The direction of shallow subsurface riverbank flow at the site is also reactive to storm events, temporarily aligning with the surface flow direction and then reverting back to preevent conditions. Such a transition of flow paths during events is also likely to lead to expansion of lateral hyporheic exchange. This study provides evidence that storm events can be a key driver of enhanced hyporheic exchange in gaining river systems, which may support nutrient reactions beyond the duration of event-driven change. Our observations demonstrate the dynamic nature of the hyporheic zone, which should be considered when evaluating its biogeochemical function.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000351401200020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTemporal%2Bresponses%2Bof%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bto%2Bsuccessive%2Bstorm%2Bevents%26rft.aufirst%3DMarina%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DDudley-Southern%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR016623%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1126%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1112-1126%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1112%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DDudley-Southern%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DBinley%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
38,"Miller, RL",Feb 2022 ,Reduced-complexity model of stream temperature,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"In this article, a process-based model of time-varying stream temperatures is developed. The integrated compartment-based model balances a need to account for the major physical components of the heat balance at specific sites while maintaining computational efficiency. The ability of the model to simulate instantaneous temperatures is demonstrated at six study locations in the sub-tropical, low-gradient region of Southern Louisiana, USA. The model yielded Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) scores of 0.9 and above and an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.07 degrees C for hourly water temperature over a six-month period. The parameter sensitivity analysis demonstrates the variable significance of vaporization and bed sediment conduction across the different study locations. The results show that the sediment heat exchange may have a significant seasonal effect on the energy budgets of streams where flows are a large component of the heat balance in temperate climates. The model is well-suited to serve as a simple physically based thermal impact assessment tool for streams and potentially many other types of waterbodies as well. The model also complements the widely used meteorological- and statistical-based methodologies applied in the development of tributary and headwater temperature boundary conditions for large-scale river temperature studies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000723110900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DReduced-complexity%2Bmodel%2Bof%2Bstream%2Btemperature%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DRL%26rft.aulast%3DMiller%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.3909%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D279%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D267-279%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D267%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DMiller%252C%2BRL%26rft.au%3DYoung%252C%2BTJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
39,"Lamontagne, S",Nov 2007 ,Estimation of hyporheic water residence time in situ using Rn-222 disequilibrium,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS,"Radon-222 is a naturally occurring radioactive gas (half-life = 3.8 d) that is emitted by virtually all geologic materials. Stream sediment porewater tends to approach an equilibrium Rn-222 activity determined by the Rn-222 production rate of the sediments and radon half-life. However, this equilibrium may not be reached when porewaters are diluted with low Rn-222 surface waters by hyporheic exchange. Thus, the hyporheic water residence time (t(h)) can be estimated in situ based on the difference in measured hyporheic Rn-222 activity relative to Rn-222 activity in the absence of hyporheic exchange. To validate Rn-222-derived t(h) estimates, a pulse in-stream bromide injection and a continuous in-stream injection of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) were made in a subtropical stream (Swamp Oak Creek, Australia) along a reach with a sand, gravel, and cobble streambed. The bromide injection estimated t(h) indirectly from the shape of upstream and downstream in-stream breakthrough curves, whereas the SF6 injection estimated t(h) directly by the determination of hyporheic breakthrough curves. The average t(h) obtained with Rn-222 disequilibrium (0.095 +/- 0.086 d; +/- SD) was similar to that obtained using bromide injection (0.10 +/- 0.026 d) and within the range estimated from SF6 injection (0.05-0.2 d). Unlike the commonly used in-stream breakthough curves of injected tracers, the Rn-222 disequilibrium technique is advantageous because it measures t(h) of transient storage for the hyporheic zone only. The Rn-222 disequilibrium technique is only applicable to estimate t(h) in the range of hours to days, but this is the range of interest in many hyporheic studies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000251564700004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEstimation%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bwater%2Bresidence%2Btime%2Bin%2Bsitu%2Busing%2BRn-222%2Bdisequilibrium%26rft.aufirst%3DSebastien%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DLamontagne%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flom.2007.5.407%26rft.epage%3D416%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1541-5856%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D407-416%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D407%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR-METH%26rft.volume%3D5%26rft.au%3DLamontagne%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DCook%252C%2BPG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
40,"Higashino, M",Jun 2013 ,Quantifying a significance of sediment particle size to hyporheic sedimentary oxygen demand with a permeable stream bed,ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS,"A mechanistic model of sedimentary oxygen demand (SOD) for hyporheic flow is presented. The permeable sediment bed, e.g. sand or fine gravel, is considered with hydraulic conductivity in the range cm/s. Hyporheic pore water flow is induced by pressure fluctuations at the sediment/water interface due to near-bed turbulent coherent motions. A 2-D advection-diffusion equation is linked to the pore water flow model to simulate the effect of advection-dispersion driven by interstitial flow on oxygen transfer through the permeable sediment. Microbial oxygen uptake in the sediment is expressed as a function of the microbial growth rate, and is related to the sediment properties, i.e. the grain diameter and porosity . The model describes the significance of sediment particle size to oxygen transfer through the sediment and microbial oxygen uptake: With increasing grain diameter , the hydraulic conductivity increases so does the oxygen transfer rate, while particle surface area per volume (the available surface area for colonization by biofilms) decreases reducing the microbial oxygen uptake rate. Simulation results show that SOD increases as the hydraulic conductivity increases before a threshold has been reached. After that, SOD diminishes with the increment of the hydraulic conductivity (K).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000318875100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Ba%2Bsignificance%2Bof%2Bsediment%2Bparticle%2Bsize%2Bto%2Bhyporheic%2Bsedimentary%2Boxygen%2Bdemand%2Bwith%2Ba%2Bpermeable%2Bstream%2Bbed%26rft.aufirst%3DMakoto%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DHigashino%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10652-012-9262-3%26rft.epage%3D241%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1567-7419%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BFLUID%2BMECHANICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D227-241%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D227%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BFLUID%2BMECH%26rft.volume%3D13&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+FLUID+MECHANICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Stelzer, RS",Oct 2011 ,The dark side of the hyporheic zone: depth profiles of nitrogen and its processing in stream sediments,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Although it is well known that sediments can be hot spots for nitrogen transformation in streams, many previous studies have confined measurements of denitrification and nitrate retention to shallow sediments (<5 cm deep). We determined the extent of nitrate processing in deeper sediments of a sand plains stream (Emmons Creek) by measuring denitrification in core sections to a depth of 25 cm and by assessing vertical nitrate profiles, with peepers and piezometers, to a depth of 70 cm.2. Denitrification rates of sediment slurries based on acetylene block were higher in shallower core sections. However, core sections deeper than 5 cm accounted for 68% of the mean depth-integrated denitrification rate.3. Vertical hydraulic gradient and vertical profiles of pore water chloride concentration suggested that deep ground water upwelled through shallow sediments before discharging to the stream channel. The results of a two-source mixing model based on chloride concentrations suggested that the hyporheic zone was very shallow (<5 cm) in Emmons Creek.4. Vertical profiles showed that nitrate concentration in shallow ground water was about 10-60% of the nitrate concentration of deep ground water. The mean nitrate concentrations of deep and shallow ground water were 2.17 and 0.73 mg NO3-N L-1, respectively.5. Deep ground water tended to be oxic (6.9 mg O-2 L-1) but approached anoxia (0.8 mg O-2 L-1) after passing through shallow, organic carbon-rich sediments, which suggests that the decline in the nitrate concentrations of upwelling ground water was because of denitrification.6. Collectively, our results suggest that there is substantial nitrate removal occurring in deep sediments, below the hyporheic zone, in Emmons Creek. Our findings suggest that not accounting for nitrate removal in deep sediments could lead to underestimates of nitrogen processing in streams and catchments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000295013800007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bdark%2Bside%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2Bdepth%2Bprofiles%2Bof%2Bnitrogen%2Band%2Bits%2Bprocessing%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bsediments%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DRS%26rft.aulast%3DStelzer%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2011.02632.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D2033%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2021-2033%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2021%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DStelzer%252C%2BRS%26rft.au%3DBartsch%252C%2BLA%26rft.au%3DStrauss%252C%2BEA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Cheng, DW",Dec 2021 ,The evolutional states of seasonally losing unclogged stream-groundwater systems,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Losing streams are widespread in arid and semi-arid regions. Exploring the evolutional states of losing stream-groundwater systems is of great significance to understand the exchanges of water, mass and energy in stream-aquifer systems. This study is devoted to investigate the evolutional process of infiltration flux, pressure head and flow states of a seasonally losing stream-groundwater system with the semi-permeable streambeds missing (or without clogging). The paper constructs a new theoretical framework for the evolutional states of the system. In particular, it focuses on investigating the transition among different evolutional states including disconnected state, transitional state, negative-pressure connected state and positive-pressure connected state, and the critical conditions of transition between connected and disconnected states. The critical conditions associated with disconnection or connection are that 1) the zero-flux zone starts to disappear, 2) the unsaturated zone starts to disappear, and 3) the negative pressure zone starts to disappear. Analytical solutions of those critical conditions are proposed. The evolutional process of stream leakage is characterized into two stages: the first stage corresponds to the disconnected and transitional states in which the seepage fluxes decrease with time; the second stage corresponds to the fully connected state in which the seepage flux decreases rapidly again as time developing. Finally, the influence of various controlling parameters on the critical conditions is analyzed. The critical time (t(CRI1)) and critical depth (z(CRI1)) of changing from the disconnected state to the transitional state have nonlinear correlations with saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), pore-size distribution index (A) and flux at the base of the unconfined aquifer (q). The critical time (t(CRI2)) and the critical depth (z(CRI2)) of changing from the transitional state to the negative-pressure connected state and the critical time (t(CRI3)) of changing from the negative-pressure connected state to the positive-pressure connected state all have nonlinear correlations with K-s and lambda.z(CRI1) and Z(CRI2) are independent of saturated water content (theta(s)) and residual water content WO. An innovative physical interpretation is given to system evolutional states and quantifiable criteria for those evolutional states are proposed. The findings of this study can help better understand the evolutional states of seasonally losing stream-groundwater systems, and it lays a foundation for further research on water exchange, mass transport and ecological protection in stream-groundwater systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000706318300080,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B127012%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bevolutional%2Bstates%2Bof%2Bseasonally%2Blosing%2Bunclogged%2Bstream-groundwater%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DDawei%26rft.auinit%3DDW%26rft.aulast%3DCheng%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2021.127012%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.part%3DB%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D603%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BDW%26rft.au%3DZhan%252C%2BHB%26rft.au%3DFeng%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Leach, JA",Aug 15 2010 ,Above-stream microclimate and stream surface energy exchanges in a wildfire-disturbed riparian zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream temperature and riparian microclimate were characterized for a 1.5 km wildfire-disturbed reach of Fishtrap Creek, located north of Kamloops, British Columbia. A deterministic net radiation model was developed using hemispherical canopy images coupled with on-site microclimate measurements. Modelled net radiation agreed reasonably with measured net radiation. Air temperature and humidity measured at two locations above the stream, separated by 900 m, were generally similar, whereas wind speed was poorly correlated between the two sites. Modelled net radiation varied considerably along the reach, and measurements at a single location did not provide a reliable estimate of the modelled reach average. During summer, net radiation dominated the surface heat exchanges, particularly because the sensible and latent heat fluxes were normally of opposite sign and thus tended to cancel each other. All surface heat fluxes shifted to negative values in autumn and were of similar magnitude through winter. In March, net radiation became positive, but heat gains were cancelled by sensible and latent heat fluxes, which remained negative. A modelling exercise using three canopy cover scenarios (current, simulated pre-wildfire and simulated complete vegetation removal) showed that net radiation under the standing dead trees was double that modelled for the pre-fire canopy cover. However, post-disturbance standing dead trees reduce daytime net radiation reaching the stream surface by one-third compared with complete vegetation removal. The results of this study have highlighted the need to account for reach-scale spatial variability of energy exchange processes, especially net radiation, when modelling stream energy budgets.

44,"Murgulet, D",Dec 1 2016 ,"Impact of hydrological alterations on river-groundwater exchange and water quality in a semi-arid area: Nueces River, Texas",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"There is a lack of understanding and methods for assessing the effects of anthropogenic disruptions, (i.e. river fragmentation due to dam construction) on the extent and degree of groundwater-surface water interaction and geochemical processes affecting the quality of water in semi-arid, coastal catchments. This study applied a novel combination of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and elemental and isotope geochemistry in a coastal river disturbed by extended drought and periodic flooding due to the operation of multiple dams. Geochemical analyses show that the saltwater barrier causes an increase in salinity in surface water in the downstream river as a result of limited freshwater inflows, strong evaporation effects on shallow groundwater and mostly stagnant river water, and is not due to saltwater intrusion by tidal flooding. Discharge from bank storage is dominant (similar to 84%) in the downstream fragment and its contribution could increase salinity levels within the hyporheic zone and surface water. When surface water levels go up due to upstream freshwater releases the river temporarily displaces high salinity water trapped in the hyporheic zone to the underlying aquifer. Geochemical modeling shows a higher contribution of distant and deeper groundwater (similar to 40%) in the upstream river and lower discharge from bank storage (similar to 13%) through the hyporheic zone. Recharge frombank storage is a source of high salt to both upstream and downstream portions of the river but its contribution is higher below the dam. Continuous ERT imaging of the river bed complements geochemistry findings and indicate that while lithologically similar, downstream of the dam, the shallow aquifer is affected by salinization while fresher water saturates the aquifer in the upstream fragment. The relative contribution of flows (i.e. surface water releases or groundwater discharge) as related to the river fragmentation control changes of streamwater chemistry and likely impact the interpretation of seasonal trends.

45,"Wells, NS",Aug 1 2021 ,Flow regulates biological NO3- and N2O production in a turbid sub-tropical stream,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,"Streams play a critical role in attenuating the excess reactive nitrogen (N) generated from human activities. Consequently, streams can also emit significant amounts of the potent greenhouse gas N2O. Models and manipulative experiments now suggest that hydrology regulates the balance between N removal and N2O production, but validating this hypothesis under field conditions has been difficult. We aimed to redress this knowledge gap by measuring changes in the concentration and isotopic composition of NO3- (delta O-18-NO3-, delta N-15-NO3-) and N2O (delta O-18-N2O, delta N-15-N2O, N-15-N2O site preference) in the sediments and surface water of a 30 m stream reach as discharge dropped from 2.7 to 1.8 m(3) s(-1). Over the eight-day measurement period the changes in conductivity, delta O-18-H2O, and Rn-222 indicated that hyporheic mixing decreased and net groundwater inputs increased as discharge declined. This coincided with increases in surface water NO3- (1-3 mg N l(-1)) and N2O (700-1000% saturation) that were beyond what could be explained by increased groundwater N inputs. Instead, both N2O and NO3- isotopic composition indicated that concentration increases were caused by increasing within-stream production (nitrification), rather than decreased reduction (denitrification), as hyporheic exchange decreased. This highlights the importance of oxidising processes in regulating N cycling even under strongly heterotrophic conditions (productivity/respiration: 0.005-0.2). Together these findings provide a first empirical confirmation that relatively short term (daily-weekly) stream flow dynamics directly regulate biological cycling of both NO3- and N2O.

However, that method treated all related parameters as deterministic values, while real-world parameters are not fixed but vary widely around their means. In this study, we improved on this approach by converting it into a probabilistic method, in which the principal parameters in the governing equation were considered random values and were sampled using Monte-Carlo simulation. We conducted repeated heat transfer analyses for each case and collected the resulting hyporheic zone depths as probabilistic distributions.

Four porewater stations exhibiting differing sedimentologic and hydrologic characteristics were sampled over an annual cycle. We found that concentrations of DOG, oxygen, bacterial biomass and production decreased significantly within the first meter from the sediment-water interface. Differences in the grain size distribution among the sampling stations led to spatial heterogeneity in the permeability of the riparian sediments and in the hydraulic residence time of the infiltrating river water, resulting in specific patterns in DOC immobilization and microbial respiration. Porewater bacterial abundance and production and apparent microbial oxygen consumption were positively correlated with the hydraulic residence time of the infiltrating water. DOC occasionally accumulated in the shallow porewater layers during the winter. During the summer, DOC infiltrating from the river surface potentially explained only 36 +/- 25% of the apparent interstitial oxygen consumption. This suggests that particulate organic carbon (POC) contributes substantially to the microbial organic carbon supply in the hyporheic zone. We conclude that: the availability of POC rather than DOC infiltration determines hyporheic microbial metabolism.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000169446700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImmobilization%2Band%2Bbacterial%2Butilization%2Bof%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bentering%2Bthe%2Briparian%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bthe%2Balpine%2BEnns%2BRiver%252C%2BAustria%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DBrugger%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3354%252Fame024129%26rft.epage%3D142%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0948-3055%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BMICROBIAL%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D129-142%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D129%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BMICROB%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DBrugger%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DWett%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DHerndl%252C%2BGJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+MICROBIAL+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Change in the glacial domain in terms of melt increase will change discharge and sediment flux into fluvial system, which will induce changes in fluvial processes and forms. The present work attempts to study this process-based glacio-fluvial coupling in the two neighbouring glaciated river basins in the Northwest Himalaya, viz., the Sutlej and the Yamuna river basins till the mountain front. A total of 194 samples of river, tributary and groundwater of pre-and post-monsoon seasons in the two river basins were analysed for stable isotopes. The trend of delta O-18 and electrical conductivity along the mainstream gives qualitative idea on the influence of headwaters in the downstream of the catchment thereby allowing inference on melt contribution. Further, two component mixing model using stable oxygen isotope of two seasons water samples showed that melt contributes about 41.1-66.8 and 6.6-10.6% at different points to the total river discharge in the Sutlej and the Tons River (the glaciated, major tributary of the Yamuna River) basins, respectively. For different scenarios of increase in melt, stream power increase in the Sutlej River basin is significant as opposed to the Tons River. River channel in the Sutlej River basin will be significantly more impacted in comparison with the Yamuna River system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000418850500017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B809%26rft.atitle%3DEstimation%2Bof%2Bsnow%2Band%2Bglacial%2Bmelt%2Bcontribution%2Bthrough%2Bstable%2Bisotopes%2Band%2Bassessment%2Bof%2Bits%2Bimpact%2Bon%2Briver%2Bmorphology%2Bthrough%2Bstream%2Bpower%2Bapproach%2Bin%2Btwo%2BHimalayan%2Briver%2Bbasins%26rft.aufirst%3DL.%2BSardine%26rft.auinit%3DLS%26rft.aulast%3DVaray%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-017-7142-3%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D23%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D76%26rft.au%3DVaray%252C%2BLS%26rft.au%3DRai%252C%2BSP%26rft.au%3DJain%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Naranjo, RC",Jan 26 2012 ,The use of multiobjective calibration and regional sensitivity analysis in simulating hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We describe an approach for calibrating a two-dimensional (2-D) flow model of hyporheic exchange using observations of temperature and pressure to estimate hydraulic and thermal properties. A longitudinal 2-D heat and flow model was constructed for a riffle-pool sequence to simulate flow paths and flux rates for variable discharge conditions. A uniform random sampling approach was used to examine the solution space and identify optimal values at local and regional scales. We used a regional sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of parameter correlation and nonuniqueness commonly encountered in multidimensional modeling. The results from this study demonstrate the ability to estimate hydraulic and thermal parameters using measurements of temperature and pressure to simulate exchange and flow paths. Examination of the local parameter space provides the potential for refinement of zones that are used to represent sediment heterogeneity within the model. The results indicate vertical hydraulic conductivity was not identifiable solely using pressure observations; however, a distinct minimum was identified using temperature observations. The measured temperature and pressure and estimated vertical hydraulic conductivity values indicate the presence of a discontinuous low-permeability deposit that limits the vertical penetration of seepage beneath the riffle, whereas there is a much greater exchange where the low-permeability deposit is absent. Using both temperature and pressure to constrain the parameter estimation process provides the lowest overall root-mean- square error as compared to using solely temperature or pressure observations. This study demonstrates the benefits of combining continuous temperature and pressure for simulating hyporheic exchange and flow in a riffle-pool sequence.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000299702400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW01538%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Buse%2Bof%2Bmultiobjective%2Bcalibration%2Band%2Bregional%2Bsensitivity%2Banalysis%2Bin%2Bsimulating%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DRamon%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DRC%26rft.aulast%3DNaranjo%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011179%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DNaranjo%252C%2BRC%26rft.au%3DNiswonger%252C%2BRG%26rft.au%3DMckay%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C9340pYd4oZb1ROb8FcSvP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
