0,"Drouin, G",Mar 2021 ,Pollutant Dissipation at the Sediment-Water Interface: A Robust Discrete Continuum Numerical Model and Recirculating Laboratory Experiments,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Pollutant exchange in the hyporheic zone is a major process controlling its degradation in river systems. Knowledge of mass transfer processes at the sediment-water interface (SWI) remains scarce. Accurate predictive modeling of flow driving pollutant fluxes at the SWI is currently limited. We examined mass exchange at the SWI by combining laboratory tracer experiments and the development of a flow reactive transport (FRT) model. NaCl and Foron Blue 291 tracers were used as surrogates of conservative and moderately sorptive organic pollutants, respectively. Tracer experiments in the bench-scale river channel reproduced the influence of overlying water velocities, the source of the pollutant, and its sorption capacity on pollutant exchange. A methodological framework to calibrate the FRT model against experiments was developed. Good agreement between the experimental and numerical results confirmed the robustness of the experimental setup and numerical model. The pollutant origin, either from the sediment or the overlying water, did not affect the pollutant exchange rates. The exchange rates were quasi-proportional to the overlying water velocity. The sediment bed caused retention of more than half of the initially injected mass of Foron Blue 291. The moderately sorptive tracer partitioning retarded the equilibrium up to six times compared with the conservative tracer NaCl. Numerical tests, including both overlying and vertical velocities, showed that the latter is the main factor controlling pollutant exchange at the SWI. Altogether, the model allows capturing interactions between pollutant transport and partitioning to the rivers sediment, paving the way for systematic investigations of pollutant behavior in rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000635680800043,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028932%26rft.atitle%3DPollutant%2BDissipation%2Bat%2Bthe%2BSediment-Water%2BInterface%253A%2BA%2BRobust%2BDiscrete%2BContinuum%2BNumerical%2BModel%2Band%2BRecirculating%2BLaboratory%2BExperiments%26rft.aufirst%3DGuillaume%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DDrouin%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028932%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DDrouin%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DFahs%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DPayraudeau%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

In part 1 of this two-part series we presented a large number of one-and multi-dimensional analytical solutions of the standard equilibrium advection-dispersion equation (ADE) with and without terms accounting for zero-order production and first-order decay. The solutions are extended in the current part 2 to advective-dispersive transport with simultaneous first-order mass exchange between the stream or river and zones with dead water (transient storage models), and to problems involving longitudinal advective-dispersive transport with simultaneous diffusion in fluvial sediments or near-stream subsurface regions comprising a hyporheic zone.

2,"Fytilis, N",Nov 2013 ,Coupling self-organizing maps with a Naive Bayesian classifier : Stream classification studies using multiple assessment data,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Organizing or clustering data into natural groups is one of the most fundamental aspects of understanding and mining information. The recent explosion in sensor networks and data storage associated with hydrological monitoring has created a huge potential for automating data analysis and classification of large, high-dimensional data sets. In this work, we develop a new classification tool that couples a Naive Bayesian classifier with a neural network clustering algorithm (i.e., Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM)). The combined Bayesian-SOM algorithm reduces classification error by leveraging the Bayesian's ability to accommodate parameter uncertainty with the SOM's ability to reduce high-dimensional data to lower dimensions. The resulting algorithm is data-driven, nonparametric and is as computationally efficient as a Naive Bayesian classifier due to its parallel architecture. We apply, evaluate and test the Bayesian-SOM network using two real-world hydrological data sets. The first uses genetic data to classify the state of disease in native fish populations in the upper Madison River, MT, USA. The second uses stream geomorphic and water quality data measured at similar to 2500 Vermont stream reaches to predict habitat conditions. The new classification tool has substantial benefits over traditional classification methods due to its ability to dynamically update prior information, assess the uncertainty/confidence of the posterior probability values, and visualize both the input data and resulting probabilistic clusters onto two-dimensional maps to better assess nonlinear mappings between the two.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000328683800042,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B7747-7762%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bself-organizing%2Bmaps%2Bwith%2Ba%2BNaive%2BBayesian%2Bclassifier%2B%253A%2BStream%2Bclassification%2Bstudies%2Busing%2Bmultiple%2Bassessment%2Bdata%26rft.aufirst%3DNikolaos%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DFytilis%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2012WR013422%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7762%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7747-7762%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7747%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DFytilis%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DRizzo%252C%2BDM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The heavy metals profile was observed in the order of Sediments > Fish > Water and Ikom Station I > Obubra Station II > Ekori Station III > Ikot Okpora Station IV > Ikot Offiong Station V > Calabar Station VI respectively. Most of the heavy metals were below the maximum allowable levels set by the WHO, FEPA, and USEPA except Zinc with mean concentration of 0.099 +/- 0.00404 mu g.g(-1) which is above recommended limit of 0.0766 mu g.g(-1) of USEPA in the sediment at Ikom. This implies that the waste assimilation capacity of the river is high, a phenomenon that could be ascribed to dilution, sedimentation and continuous water exchange. This is an indication that an urban and industrial waste discharged into the Cross River has a significant effect on the ecological balance of the river.

4,"Philipsen, LJ",Nov 2022 ,Riparian recruitment persists after damming: Environmental flows and coupled colonization of cottonwoods and willows following floods along a dryland river,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"For riparian woodlands, occasional floods provide geomorphic disturbance that creates barren colonization sites, and river stage patterns that enable seedling establishment. To investigate impacts from river damming and instream flow regulation on these processes, we studied the lower Red Deer River in the semi-arid region of Alberta, Canada. Dickson Dam was implemented in 1983 and although major flood peaks in June 2005 and June 2013 were attenuated by about one-quarter, substantial seedling establishment of plains cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) was observed. Cross-sectional transects in 2014 and 2015 revealed the reproductively mature cottonwood band from 2005, while the 2013 colonization was limited to low elevations of 0.3-1.3 m above the base river stage. Seedling numbers and the elevational ranges were probably reduced by abrupt (>4 cm/day) river stage reductions in July 2005 and in July 2013. In addition to direct seedling establishment on barren sandbars, we observed ""coupled colonization"" with cottonwood recruitment within sparse patches of sandbar willows (Salix exigua). The flood-tolerant willows stabilize the bars and increase aggradation through sediment trapping. Thus, cottonwood colonization persisted after damming, indicating that the pattern of downstream flow regulation was important, rather than damming per se. To sustain riparian recruitment along regulated rivers in dry regions, we recommend: (1) that floods be allowed as feasible, (2) higher river stages during seed dispersal, (3) flow ramping (gradual summer recession) for seedling survival, (4) sufficient growing season flows to avoid drought-induced mortality, and (5) that willows be encouraged as well as cottonwoods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000835854500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiparian%2Brecruitment%2Bpersists%2Bafter%2Bdamming%253A%2BEnvironmental%2Bflows%2Band%2Bcoupled%2Bcolonization%2Bof%2Bcottonwoods%2Band%2Bwillows%2Bfollowing%2Bfloods%2Balong%2Ba%2Bdryland%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DLaurens%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DLJ%26rft.aulast%3DPhilipsen%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.4030%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D1653%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1642-1653%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1642%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DPhilipsen%252C%2BLJ%26rft.au%3DRood%252C%2BSB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"ZWICK, P",Jun 1992 ,STREAM HABITAT FRAGMENTATION - A THREAT TO BIODIVERSITY,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Biodiversity is undisturbed rhithral streams in central Europe is high, with about 1000 resident metazoan species; over 600 insect species occur in the Fulda river (Germany). Longitudinal downstream shift of dominance from rheobiontic to rheophilous and finally to ubiquituos rheoxenic taxa in the potamal is described. Present downstream importance of ubiquituous species probably results from replacement of original potamal communities, present faunas being surrogates. Species losses through human impact are well documented for fish. The case of Plecoptera (10 potamal species either altogether extinct, extinct in Central Europe or extremely endangered) suggests that potamal invertebrates suffered as severe losses as did fish.Human impact on major rivers was so severe also because they occur at distances beyond average dispersal capacity of the fauna, i.e. are widely separate ecological islands, with known risk of species losses. In contrast, faunal exchange between adjacent headwater streams in mountains with intact stream nets is easy, certainly for amphibious insects. However, damage to rhithral streams is becoming increasingly frequent. This fragments stream nets, turning also upper parts of drainage systems into ecological islands, with danger of extinctions. Rhithral biodiversity is thought to be much more endangered by human impact than is presently recognized.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1992JQ67100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSTREAM%2BHABITAT%2BFRAGMENTATION%2B-%2BA%2BTHREAT%2BTO%2BBIODIVERSITY%26rft.aufirst%3DP%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DZWICK%26rft.date%3D1992%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00731036%26rft.epage%3D97%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0960-3115%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DBIODIVERSITY%2BAND%2BCONSERVATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D80-97%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D80%26rft.stitle%3DBIODIVERS%2BCONSERV%26rft.volume%3D1&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=BIODIVERSITY+AND+CONSERVATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Such a split approach restricts the optimal usages of these water resources in several water management applications. The present study aims to shed light on the complex interaction of surface-groundwater interactions in terms of groundwater recharge from drainage network towards the adjacent aquafer and conversely, groundwater discharge from the aquifer towards the drainage network in the Gharehsoo River Basin (GRB), with the enclosed Ardabil aquifer, located in northwest Iran. To that end, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), as the surface hydrological model was fully coupled with the latest version of the Modular Three-Dimensional Finite-Difference Groundwater Flow (MODFLOW-NWT) (Newton-Raphson Technique to improve the solutions of unconfined groundwater-flow problems). The total study period, i.e. 1978-2012 was split into two intervals for calibration (1988-2012) and validation (1978-1987). To facilitate and expedite the calibration of the coupled model, first we calibrated SWAT and MODFLOW-NWT independently against the observed streamflow and groundwater head time series, respectively. Afterwards, we recalibrated the coupled model SWAT-MODFLOW. To link these two models, the surface and sub-surface water flow components are exchanged between the Disaggregated Hydrological Response Units (DHRUs) of SWAT with the MODFLOW-NWT' grid cells. In addition, three more flow components are sequentially exchanged: the deep percolation from SWAT to MODFLOW-NWT, baseflow/groundwater discharge from MODFLOW-NWT to SWAT, and the river heads from SWAT to MODFLOW-NWT. The results of the application show that the coupled model satisfactorily, quantified by R(2)0.5, simulates streamflow and particularly, groundwater heads. In fact, both observations and simulations indicate that, owing to an ongoing overexploitation of the aquifer, heads havebeen decreased steadily over the studied period which has led to a parallel decline of the groundwater storage. Moreover, the analysis of the stream-aquifer exchange flows indicates that groundwater discharge towards the stream-network (effluent conditions) is orders of magnitude higher than the opposite process (influent conditions). In addition, findings reveal that many of the tributaries across the GRB have shifted from a perennial regime to ephemeral/intermittent system over the past decades. The provided and well-tested coupled model would be a viable asset to assess a wide range of plausible scenarios to identify most effective and practical water resource management schemes to recover the severely depleted surface water and groundwater resources of the GRB.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000460690200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B201%26rft.atitle%3DAnalysis%2Bof%2Bspatio-temporal%2Bvariability%2Bof%2Bsurface-groundwater%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Bthe%2BGharehsoo%2Briver%2Bbasin%252C%2BIran%252C%2Busing%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2BSWAT-MODFLOW%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DMajid%2BTaie%26rft.auinit%3DMT%26rft.aulast%3DSemiromi%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-019-8206-3%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D78%26rft.au%3DSemiromi%252C%2BMT%26rft.au%3DKoch%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Multiple relationships including total nitrogen (log(10)TN) and water depth (log(10)Z) were established. Further analyses found that the absolute Chi a and slope of log(10)Chl a=f (log(10)TP) in the river-connected lakes were obviously lower than those in the river-isolated lakes.

There was also no relationship between stream flow and pH, which is indicative of chronic acidification. Indications of microbial reduction of sulphate were found in some places near the stream, but the near-stream zone did not have a general impact on the sulphate concentration in discharging groundwater. The near-stream zone was a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the stream, which had a median DOC of 6.8 mg L-1. The influence on stream acidity from organic anions was overshadowed by the effect of sulphate, however, except during a spring flow episode, when additional organic matter was flushed out and the sulphate-rich ground water was mixed with more diluted event water. Ion exchange was not an important process in the near-stream zone of the Kindla catchment. Different functions of the near-stream zone relating to discharge acidity are reported in the literature. In this study there was even a variation within the site. There is therefore a need for more case studies to provide a more detailed understanding of the net effects that the near-stream zone can have on stream chemistry under different circumstances.

9,"Bonada, N",Nov 2013 ,Mediterranean-climate streams and rivers: geographically separated but ecologically comparable freshwater systems,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Streams and rivers in mediterranean-climate regions (med-rivers in med-regions) are ecologically unique, with flow regimes reflecting precipitation patterns. Although timing of drying and flooding is predictable, seasonal and annual intensity of these events is not. Sequential flooding and drying, coupled with anthropogenic influences make these med-rivers among the most stressed riverine habitat worldwide. Med-rivers are hotspots for biodiversity in all med-regions. Species in med-rivers require different, often opposing adaptive mechanisms to survive drought and flood conditions or recover from them. Thus, metacommunities undergo seasonal differences, reflecting cycles of river fragmentation and connectivity, which also affect ecosystem functioning. River conservation and management is challenging, and trade-offs between environmental and human uses are complex, especially under future climate change scenarios. This overview of a Special Issue on med-rivers synthesizes information presented in 21 articles covering the five med-regions worldwide: Mediterranean Basin, coastal California, central Chile, Cape region of South Africa, and southwest and southern Australia.

10,"Cucchi, K",Sep 3 2021 ,Estimating Hydrothermal Properties and High-Frequency Fluxes From Geophysical Measurements in the Hyporheic Zone,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Located in the critical zone at the intersection between surface water and groundwater, hyporheic zones (HZ) host a variety of hydrological, biological and biogeochemical processes regulating water availability and quality and sustaining riverine ecosystems. However, difficulty in quantifying water fluxes along this interface has limited our understanding of these processes, in particular under dynamic flow conditions where rapid variations can impact large-scale HZ biogeochemical function. In this study, we introduce an innovative measurement assimilation chain for determining uncertainty-quantified hydraulic and thermal HZ properties, as well as associated uncertainty-quantified high-frequency water fluxes. The chain consists in the assimilation of data collected with the LOMOS-mini geophysical device with a process-based, Bayesian approach. The application of this approach on a synthetic case study shows that hydraulic and thermal HZ properties can be estimated from LOMOS-mini measurements, their identifiability depending on the Peclet number - summarizing the hydrological and thermal regime. Hydraulic conductivity values can be estimated with precision when greater than similar to 10(-5)m center dot s(-1) when other HZ properties are unknown, with decreasing uncertainty when other HZ properties are known prior to starting the LOMOS-mini measurement assimilation procedure. Water fluxes can be estimated in all regimes with varying accuracy, highest accuracy is reached for fluxes greater than similar to 10(-6)m center dot s(-1), except under highly conductive exfiltration regimes. We apply the methodology on in situ datasets by deriving uncertainty-quantified HZ properties and water fluxes for 2 data points collected during field campaigns. This study demonstrates that the LOMOS-mini monitoring technology can be used as complete and stand-alone sampling solution for quantifying water and heat exchanges under dynamic exchange conditions (time resolution < 15 min).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000697122600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B700274%26rft.atitle%3DEstimating%2BHydrothermal%2BProperties%2Band%2BHigh-Frequency%2BFluxes%2BFrom%2BGeophysical%2BMeasurements%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DKarina%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DCucchi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2021.700274%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D3%26rft.au%3DCucchi%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DFlipo%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DRubin%252C%2BYN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
11,"Marion, A",Sep 25 2008 ,Hyporheic flows in stratified beds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Surface-subsurface exchange fluxes are receiving increasing interest because of their importance in the fate of contaminants, nutrients, and other ecologically relevant substances in a variety of aquatic systems. Solutions have previously been developed for pore water flows induced by geometrical irregularities such as bed forms for the cases of homogeneous sediment beds and idealized heterogeneous beds, but these solutions have not accounted for the fact that streambed sediments are subject to sorting processes that often produce well-defined subsurface structures. Sediments at the streambed surface are often coarser than the underlying material because of size-selective sediment transport, producing relatively thin armor layers. Episodic erosional and depositional processes also create thick layers of different composition within the porous medium, forming stratified beds. A series of experiments were conducted to observe conservative solute transport in armored and stratified beds. An analytical solution was developed for advective exchange with stratified beds and provides appropriate scaling of the physical variables that control exchange flows. The results show that armor layers are too thin to significantly alter the advective pumping process but provide significant solute storage at short time scales. Stratified beds with layers of significant thickness favor development of horizontal flow paths within the bed and change the rate of solute transfer across the stream-subsurface interface compared to homogeneous beds.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000259610100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW09433%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bflows%2Bin%2Bstratified%2Bbeds%26rft.aufirst%3DAndrea%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarion%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2007WR006079%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DMarion%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DBottacin-Busolin%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
12,"Lakhanpal, G",,"Micro-computed tomography scanning approaches to quantify, parameterize and visualize bioturbation activity in clogged streambeds: A proof of concept",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Fine particle clogging and faunal bioturbation are two key processes co-occurring in the hyporheic zone that potentially affect hyporheic exchange through modifications in the sediment structure of streambeds. Clogging results from excessive fine sediment infiltration and deposition in rivers, and it is known to decrease matrix porosity and potentially reduce permeability. Faunal bioturbation activity may compensate for the negative effect of clogging by reworking the sediment, increasing porosity, and preventing further infiltration of fines. Although both processes of clogging and bioturbation have received significant attention in the literature separately, their combined effects on streambed sediment structure are not well understood, mostly due to the lack of a standard methodology for their assessment. Here, we illustrate a novel methodology using X-ray computed tomography (CT), as proof of concept, to investigate how, together, clogging and bioturbation affect streambed porosity in a controlled flow-through flume. By visualising gallery formations of an upward conveyor macroinvertebrate; Lumbriculus variegatus as a model species, we quantified bioturbation activity in a clogged streambed, focusing on orientation, depth, and volume at downwelling and upwelling areas of the flume. Gallery creation increased the porosity of the streambed sediment, suggesting a potential improvement in permeability and a possible offset of clogging effects. We illustrate the promising use of X-ray CT as a tool to assess bioturbation in clogged streambeds, and the potential role of bioturbation activity supporting hyporheic exchange processes in streambeds, warranting further studies to understand the extent of bioturbation impacts in natural systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000911345200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMicro-computed%2Btomography%2Bscanning%2Bapproaches%2Bto%2Bquantify%252C%2Bparameterize%2Band%2Bvisualize%2Bbioturbation%2Bactivity%2Bin%2Bclogged%2Bstreambeds%253A%2BA%2Bproof%2Bof%2Bconcept%26rft.aufirst%3DGarima%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DLakhanpal%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.4096%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.au%3DLakhanpal%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DBlack%252C%2BJR%26rft.au%3DStewardson%252C%2BMJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"Price, JM",Mar 15 2015 ,Influences of sudden changes in discharge and physical stream characteristics on transient storage and nitrate uptake in an urban stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Changes in the physical structure of urban streams can occur abruptly due to flashy high-flow events and subsequently alter stream processes, including transient storage and nitrate uptake. We examined temporal variability in transient storage and nitrate uptake by exploring the effects of altered physical characteristics resulting from a single high-flow event in three reaches of Spring Creek, an urban stream in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. Study reaches of varying geomorphic and hydraulic characteristics were chosen to represent distinct geomorphic settings in terms of substrate size, sinuosity, bed slope, and degree of rehabilitation and structural controls. We performed detailed physical characterizations and multiple nutrient injections of Br- and NO3- to estimate transient storage and nitrate uptake in each reach. A comparison of pre-flood and post-flood data indicates that transient storage and nitrate uptake are highly context specific and mediated by interactions between geomorphic setting and flood discharge. In the two reaches that showed significant post-flood increases in transient storage (250% to 350% increases in F-med(200)), the pool-riffle reach exhibited a significant increase in uptake velocity, while the channelized reach did not. In contrast, transient storage decreased post-flood in the third reach containing hydraulic structures. These complex responses likely reflect reach-specific differences in hyporheic versus in-channel storage. This study shows that repeat injections are necessary to describe nutrient dynamics because transient storage and nitrate uptake can be highly variable over time (showing changes on the order of 100%) due to variation in discharge and geomorphically influential flow events.

14,"Stein, JL",Jun 15 2002 ,Spatial analysis of anthropogenic river disturbance at regional and continental scales: identifying the wild rivers of Australia,LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING,"A method for assessing anthropogenic river disturbance is described. The grid-based spatial modeling procedure computes indices of disturbance for individual stream sections. These indices rank streams along a continuum from near-pristine to severely disturbed. The method couples geographical data, recording the extent and intensity of human activities known to impact on river condition, with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used for drainage analysis. It was developed to produce the first nation-wide assessment of river disturbance from which Australia's least disturbed or 'wild' rivers were identified. A national summary of the extent and the potential impact of human activities is presented, calculated from the disturbance index values computed for more than 1.5 x 10(6) stream sections with a total length of over 3 x 10(6) km. Index values close to the undisturbed end of the continuum are rare, especially among large rivers. Most of the least disturbed streams are predicted to lie within the monsoonal tropical north or the arid/semi-arid center of the continent.The disturbance indices generated provide a comprehensive and consistent characterization of river and catchment disturbance that has applications beyond the identification of wild rivers. These include identification of priorities for rehabilitation and restoration; development of systematic survey strategies for aquatic, riparian and estuarine biota and identification of reserve networks for river systems. However, these applications depend on validating the correlation between river disturbance indices and intensively sampled physical and biological indicators of river condition.

15,"Zibret, G",Jul 2017 ,"Multi-elemental composition of the Sava River sediments (Slovenia, EU)",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"The Sava River is the longest river in Slovenia and has been subjected to pollution in the past. Fine-grained channel sediments, whichwere deposited during the high-water event in July 2009, along the river course in Slovenia were sampled at 12 locations in order to determine the content of a large set of chemical elements and assess possible levels of pollution. Sediment samples were air-dried. Two grain size fractions (<0.063 and <0.125 mm) were prepared for chemical analyses by dry sieving. Elemental levels of each sample were determined after aqua regia extraction (1 h, 95 degrees C) by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Elemental levels did not exceed the legislation action limit values, indicating that the Sava River recently deposited alluvial sediments are not contaminated with potentially toxic metals. The results show that the chemical composition of the Sava River sediments is comparable to the average composition of stream sediments within Europe. Some light impacts of anthropogenic activities and lithological-driven influential factors to the elemental composition of sediments were observed. Slight As enrichment is possibly a consequence of eroding of slag dumps and Ascontaminated soil on Sava River banks and emissions from treated sewage waters. Lead (Pb) is increased in the Litija area as a consequence of historic mining and increased zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) concentrations after the Savinja River confluence because of historic smelting industry in its catchment area. Phosphorous levels in sediments are very likely driven by the emissions from farming and urbanisation. Increased Ba and Pb levels (but still being below the action value) are detected in sample downstream Krsko.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000406241000034,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B501%26rft.atitle%3DMulti-elemental%2Bcomposition%2Bof%2Bthe%2BSava%2BRiver%2Bsediments%2B%2528Slovenia%252C%2BEU%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DGorazd%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DZibret%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-017-6835-y%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D14%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D76%26rft.au%3DZibret%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DGosar%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
16,"Bhaskar, AS",Aug 29 2012 ,Resolving hyporheic and groundwater components of streambed water flux using heat as a tracer,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic and groundwater fluxes typically occur together in permeable sediments beneath flowing stream water. However, streambed water fluxes quantified using the thermal method are usually interpreted as representing either groundwater or hyporheic fluxes. Our purpose was to improve understanding of co-occurring groundwater and hyporheic fluxes using streambed temperature measurements and analysis of one-dimensional heat transport in shallow streambeds. First, we examined how changes in hyporheic and groundwater fluxes affect their relative magnitudes by reevaluating previously published simulations. These indicated that flux magnitudes are largely independent until a threshold is crossed, past which hyporheic fluxes are diminished by much larger (1000-fold) groundwater fluxes. We tested accurate quantification of co-occurring fluxes using one-dimensional approaches that are appropriate for analyzing streambed temperature data collected at field sites. The thermal analytical method, which uses an analytical solution to the one-dimensional heat transport equation, was used to analyze results from a numerical heat transport model, in which hyporheic flow was represented as increased thermal dispersion at shallow depths. We found that co-occurring groundwater and hyporheic fluxes can be quantified in streambeds, although not always accurately. For example, using a temperature time series collected in a sandy streambed, we found that hyporheic and groundwater flow could both be detected when thermal dispersion due to hyporheic flow was significant compared to thermal conduction. We provide guidance for when thermal data can be used to quantify both hyporheic and groundwater fluxes, and we show that neglecting thermal dispersion may affect accuracy and interpretation of estimated streambed water fluxes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000308311300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08524%26rft.atitle%3DResolving%2Bhyporheic%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bcomponents%2Bof%2Bstreambed%2Bwater%2Bflux%2Busing%2Bheat%2Bas%2Ba%2Btracer%26rft.aufirst%3DAditi%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DBhaskar%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011784%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DBhaskar%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DHenry%252C%2BEJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"Whitney, JE",Dec 2015 ,Consecutive wildfires affect stream biota in cold- and warmwater dryland river networks,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Climate change and fire suppression have altered fire regimes globally, leading to larger, more frequent, and more severe wildfires. Responses of coldwater stream biota to single wildfires are well studied, but measured responses to consecutive wildfires in warmwater systems that often include mixed assemblages of native and nonnative taxa are lacking. We quantified changes in physical habitat, resource availability, and biomass of cold- and warmwater oligochaetes, insects, crayfish, fishes, and tadpoles following consecutive megafires (covering >100 km(2)) in the upper Gila River, New Mexico, USA. We were particularly interested in comparing responses of native and nonnative fishes that might have evolved under different disturbance regimes. Changes in habitat and resource availability were related to cumulative fire effects, fire size, and postfire precipitation. The 2nd of 2 consecutive wildfires in the basin was larger and, coupled with moderate postfire discharge, resulted in increased siltation and decreased algal biomass. Several insect taxa responded to these fires with reduced biomass, whereas oligochaete biomass was unaffected. Biomass of 6 of 7 native fish species decreased after the fires, and decreases were associated with site proximity to fire. Nonnative fish decreases after fire were most pronounced for coldwater salmonids, and warmwater nonnative fishes exhibited limited responses. All crayfish and tadpoles collected were nonnative and were unresponsive to fire disturbance. More pronounced responses of native insects and fishes to fires indicate that increasing fire size and frequency threatens the persistence of native fauna and suggests that management activities promoting ecosystem resilience might help ameliorate wildfire effects.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000364815000025,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConsecutive%2Bwildfires%2Baffect%2Bstream%2Bbiota%2Bin%2Bcold-%2Band%2Bwarmwater%2Bdryland%2Briver%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DJE%26rft.aulast%3DWhitney%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F683391%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D1526%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1510-1526%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1510%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DWhitney%252C%2BJE%26rft.au%3DGido%252C%2BKB%26rft.au%3DTurner%252C%2BTF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
18,"Franciskovic-Bilinski, S",Mar 2014 ,Magnetic spherules in sediments of the karstic Dobra River (Croatia),JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"The paper describes an unusual finding of magnetic particles in stream sediments of the karstic Dobra River (Croatia). It aims to investigate the magnetic susceptibility properties of river sediments and to find links with their mineralogical and chemical composition. The goal of our research was to suggest the possible origin of magnetic particles in the river sediments within the Dinaric karst region, which to our knowledge was not exposed to metal manufacturing processes.A preliminary, exploratory sediment sampling programme was undertaken. Sediments were collected near the channel bank (from the top layer) at 16 representative stations distributed along the length of the Dobra River (110 km). Sediments were air-dried and passed through 2-mm and 63-mu m sieves, and analysed for magnetic susceptibility (and Curie temperature), isothermal remanent magnetism (IRM), stereo-microscopy of separated magnetic grains, mineralogical analysis (using X-ray diffraction), and chemical analysis (using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry).Increased magnetic susceptibility and IRM values were observed mostly in the sediments of the Upper Dobra. Thermomagnetic curves show a distinctive Curie-point of magnetite at 580 A degrees C. Additional transformation observed at 520-560 A degrees C derives from titanomagnetite. There was no significant correlation between magnetic susceptibility and Fe. Magnetic particles from the Dobra River sediments contain pyroxene, plagioclase, hematite and quartz, in addition to magnetite. White spherules within magnetic grains are also present. The major constituent of five separated magnetic spherules is Fe; the minor constituents are Al, Ca, Mg and Si, and there are numerous trace elements (Ba, Cr, K, Mn, Na, Ni, Ti and V). The ratio Ni/ Fe versus Cr/Fe suggests that the magnetic spherules are impactites.Magnetic spherules were discovered for the first time in stream sediments of the sinking karstic Dobra River, a region where anthropogenic sources for that contribution are absent. Preliminary results point to a possible impactite, formed either by a shock event caused by a meteorite impact or by volcanic processes. The presence of magnetic spherules in the fluvial sediments of the Upper Dobra River represents a new and exciting finding and deserves further field work and laboratory research.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000331642000015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMagnetic%2Bspherules%2Bin%2Bsediments%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bkarstic%2BDobra%2BRiver%2B%2528Croatia%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DStanislav%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFranciskovic-Bilinski%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11368-013-0808-x%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7480%26rft.epage%3D614%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1439-0108%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BSOILS%2BAND%2BSEDIMENTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D600-614%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D600%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BSOIL%2BSEDIMENT%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DFranciskovic-Bilinski%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DBilinski%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DMaldini%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+SOILS+AND+SEDIMENTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Khosronejad, A",Jul 2015 ,Numerical simulation of large dunes in meandering streams and rivers with in-stream rock structures,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The evolution and migration of large dunes in a realistic intermediate-size experimental stream, the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) Outdoor StreamLab (OSL), and two large-scale meandering rivers with in-stream rock structures are studied numerically using the SAFL Virtual StreamLab hydro-morphodynamic (VSL3D) model. Due to the challenges arising from mesh quality and large disparity in time-scales, coupled morpho- and hydro-dynamics simulations of bed forms has, for the most part, been restricted to sand wave amplitudes of few centimeters. In this work, we overcome such difficulties by employing the immersed boundary approach and a dual time-stepping technique of the VSL3D model [63]. The VSL3D employs the curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) method along with a suspended sediment load module and is capable of simulating turbulent stratified flows coupled with bed morphodynamic evolution in realistic riverine environments with arbitrarily complex hydraulic structures. Turbulence is handled either via large-eddy simulation (LES) with the dynamic Smagorinski subgrid scale model or unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) equations closed with the k - omega turbulence model. Simulations in the intermediate-scale OSL channel, in which we also collected experimental morphodynamic data, show that LES can capture the evolution and migration of bed forms with characteristics that are in good agreement with experimental measurements. The URANS model, however, fails to excite the bed instability in the OSL channel but captures realistic dune evolution in the two large-scale meandering rivers. This finding is especially important as it demonstrates the potential of the VSL3D model as a powerful tool for simulating morphodynamic evolution under prototype conditions. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to simulate large-scale bed forms in waterways with an order of magnitude disparity in spatial scales, from the similar to 2.7 m wide OSL channel to the 27 m wide rivers. Accordingly, the height of the simulated dunes ranges from similar to 0.2 m to 2.0 m and the wavelength ranges from similar to 0.1 m to 50 m for the OSL and large-scale rivers, respectively. For all cases the statistical properties of the simulated bed forms are shown to agree well with those of bed forms observed in nature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

20,"Liro, M",Oct 2022 ,Modelling the Effects of Dam Reservoir Backwater Fluctuations on the Hydrodynamics of a Small Mountain Stream,WATER,"The water depth and flow velocity of a river may be temporarily disturbed by the water level fluctuations connected with the operation of artificial dam reservoirs located downstream (so-called backwater fluctuations (BF)). In this research, we use the two-dimensional hydrodynamic model iRIC MFlow_02 to quantify the effects of BF on the lowermost section (ca. 1.5-km length) of a small (channel width <= 20 m) mountain stream, the Smolnik Stream, which flows into the Roznow Dam Reservoir, in Southern Poland. To reproduce the hydrological conditions generally observed in the stream, six scenarios were simulated, considering three steady flow discharges at the inlet, with recurrence intervals of 1 year (1.8 m(3) s(-1), small flood), 2 years (24.5 m(3) s(-1); medium flood), and 20 years (89.5 m(3) s(-1); large flood), and two reservoir levels at the outlet: 265 m a.s.l. (normal reservoir water level) and 270 m a.s.l. (maximum reservoir water level). In these simulations, sediment transport and morphodynamics are not considered. The average modelled water depth was increased by backwater fluctuation in the channel, from 28% (from 1.62 m vs. 2.07 m) during a small flood, up to 59% (from 3.46 m to 5.50 m) during a large flood. Contrastingly, the average modelled flow velocity was decreased in the channel (from -8% 0.52 m s(-1) vs. 0.47 m s(-1)) during a small flood to -78% (0.49 m s(-1) vs. 0.11 m s(-1)) during a large flood. Our results demonstrate that backwater fluctuations substantially disturb the hydrodynamics of the studied stream, which is interpreted as a triggering factor of the previously documented alterations in its sedimentology, morphology, and riparian vegetation pattern.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000867223600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B3166%26rft.atitle%3DModelling%2Bthe%2BEffects%2Bof%2BDam%2BReservoir%2BBackwater%2BFluctuations%2Bon%2Bthe%2BHydrodynamics%2Bof%2Ba%2BSmall%2BMountain%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DMaciej%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DLiro%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw14193166%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DLiro%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DNones%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DPlesinski%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Jerin, T",Feb 15 2021 ,Scale associated coupling between channel morphology and riparian vegetation in a bedrock-controlled stream,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Most fluvial systems exhibit systematic, continuous upstream to downstream variations in channel morphology and related ecological and hydrological parameters (emphasized by conceptual frameworks such as downstream hydraulic geometry and the river continuum concept), and discontinuous, shorter range variations (emphasized by hierarchical patch dynamics). This study investigates the relative importance of broader-scale upstream to downstream variation and local variation at the hydraulic unit scale in a bedrock-controlled stream in central Kentucky, USA. A nested ANOVA analytical approach was used to determine the relative importance of three nested spatial scales in explaining variations in channel morphology and riparian trees. Results show that channel morphology is largely controlled by local-scale variation explaining about 92% of slope, 46% of bankfull width, 99% of average depth, 54% of width-depth ratio, 86% of channel cross-sectional area, and 100% of the hydraulic radius of the channel. Different categories of substrate characteristics, however, represent anomalies with respect to variance explained at different levels. Furthermore, local-scale controls explain 60% of variations in species richness, 59% of variations in the total number of individual trees, 68% of variation in the proportion of Platanus occidentalis basal area and 43% of variation in the total number of biogeomorphic impacts. These results are consistent with the idea of tight coupling between channel morphology and riparian vegetation, although they do not, by themselves, prove such interactions. The morphological variation of the channel at the local scale is primarily attributable to the geological controls (e.g., faults, bedding planes, joints and fractures) and incision status associated with the study area. The local scale variation in vegetation pattern can be explained by the highly local edaphic differences along the riparian corridor, which is likely to be related to the local scale fluvial process-form variations, and biogeomorphic impacts and feedbacks. These patterns may therefore be common in bedrock rivers strongly influenced by geological controls. (C) 2020 The Author.

22,"Danierhan, S",Oct 1 2013 ,Coupled GSI-SVAT Model with Groundwater-Surface Water Interaction in the Riparian Zone of Tarim River,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The Tarim River is located in the arid areas of northwestern China, where groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) in different landscape units have undergone regular and duplicate transformation processes, greatly improving the utilization of water resources. Investigation of the interaction between groundwater and surface water is critical to determine proper water resources planning and management in the Tarim River region. A new approach of coupling the soil-vegetation-atmosphere transport model (SVAT) with the groundwater-surface water interaction model (GSI) is presented in this paper. Usually, the surface water recharges to groundwater and groundwater-soil water exchange are not considered in the SVAT model. However, in reality, the soil water content profiles and soil heat profiles are intensely affected by shallow groundwater table, especially in arid riparian zones where groundwater levels fluctuate substantially. A new method linking the SVAT model with the GSI model is proposed in this paper to approach this issue. The groundwater-soil water exchange and groundwater evaporation can be effectively simulated using GW-SW interface in the coupled GSI-SVAT model. The coupled model is validated in the riparian zone of the upper reaches of the Tarim River with the simulation of heat and water transfer between groundwater level and soil surface, evapotranspiration, root water uptake, and groundwater-soil water exchange. The simulation results show good consistency with experimental data, indicating that the use of this coupled model could improve the accuracy of simulation of ecological water consumption in the riparian zone. The coupled GSI-SVAT model could be used for better planning and management of water resources in arid areas.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000324466700004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2BGSI-SVAT%2BModel%2Bwith%2BGroundwater-Surface%2BWater%2BInteraction%2Bin%2Bthe%2BRiparian%2BZone%2Bof%2BTarim%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DSulitan%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DDanierhan%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HE.1943-5584.0000732%26rft.eissn%3D1943-5584%26rft.epage%3D1218%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1084-0699%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1211-1218%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1211%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DDanierhan%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DAbudu%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DDonghai%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

24,"Kaufman, MH",Mar 18 2021 ,Evaluating a Laboratory Flume Microbiome as a Window Into Natural Riverbed Biogeochemistry,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Riverbeds are hotspots for microbially-mediated reactions that exhibit pronounced variability in space and time. It is challenging to resolve biogeochemical mechanisms in natural riverbeds, as uncontrolled settings complicate data collection and interpretation. To overcome these challenges, laboratory flumes are often used as proxies for natural riverbed systems. Flumes capture spatiotemporal variability and thus allow for controlled investigations of riverbed biogeochemistry. These investigations implicitly rely on the assumption that the flume microbiome is similar to the microbiome of natural riverbeds. However, this assumption has not been tested and it is unknown how the microbiome of a flume compares to natural aquatic settings, including riverbeds. To evaluate the fundamental assumption that a flume hosts a microbiome similar to natural riverbed systems, we used 16s rRNA gene sequencing and publicly available data to compare the sediment microbiome of a single large laboratory flume to a wide variety of natural ecosystems including lake and marine sediments, river, lake, hyporheic, soil, and marine water, and bank and wetland soils. Richness and Shannon diversity metrics, analyses of variance, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and analysis of the common microbiomes between flume and river sediment all indicated that the flume microbiome more closely resembled natural riverbed sediments than other ecosystems, supporting the use of flume experiments for investigating natural microbially-mediated biogeochemical processes in riverbeds.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000677584700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B596260%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluating%2Ba%2BLaboratory%2BFlume%2BMicrobiome%2Bas%2Ba%2BWindow%2BInto%2BNatural%2BRiverbed%2BBiogeochemistry%26rft.aufirst%3DMatthew%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DMH%26rft.aulast%3DKaufman%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2021.596260%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D3%26rft.au%3DKaufman%252C%2BMH%26rft.au%3DWarden%252C%2BJG%26rft.au%3DBrown%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
25,"Shultz, CD",May 2018 ,Simulating selenium and nitrogen fate and transport in coupled stream-aquifer systems of irrigated regions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Elevated levels of selenium (Se) in aqueous environments can harm aquatic life and endanger livestock and human health. Although Se occurs naturally in the rocks and soils of many alluvial aquifers, mining and agricultural activities can increase its rate of mobilization and transport to surface waters. Attention is given here to regions where nonpoint source return flows from irrigated lands carry pollutant loads to aquifers and streams, contributing to concentrations that violate regulatory and performance standards. Of particular concern is the heightened level and mobilization of Se influenced by nitrate (NO3), a harmful pollutant in its own right. We present a numerical model that simulates the reactive transport of Se and nitrogen (N) species in a coupled groundwater-surface water system. Building upon a conceptual model that incorporates the major processes affecting Se and NO3 transport in an irrigated watershed, the model links the finite-difference models MODFLOW, UZF-RT3D, and OTIS, to simulate flow and reactive transport of multiple chemical species in both the aquifer and a stream network, with mass exchange between the two. The capability of the new model is showcased by calibration, testing, and application to a 500 km(2) region in Colorado's Lower Arkansas River Valley using a rich data set gathered over a 10-yr period. Simulation of spatial and temporal distributions of Se concentration reveals conditions that exceed standards in groundwater for approximately 20% of the area. For the Arkansas River, standards are exceeded by 290%-450%. Simulation indicates that river concentrations of NO3 alone are near the current interim standard for the total of all dissolved N species. These results indicate the need for future use of the developed model to investigate the prospects for land and water best management practices to decrease pollutant levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

26,"Boso, F",Jul 2018 ,Probabilistic Forecasting of Nitrogen Dynamics in Hyporheic Zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Nitrification-denitrification processes in the hyporheic zone control the dynamics of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species and can lead to production of nitrous oxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect. We consider DIN dynamics in an advection-dominated regime, wherein transport and reactions occur along streamlines crossing hyporheic sediments. Our focus is on the impact of uncertainty in both stream water quality and rate constants of the subsurface reactions on predictions of DIN concentrations. We derive equations for a joint probability density function (PDF), and corresponding marginal PDFs and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), of the species concentrations. Their derivation requires a novel closure, which depends on the mean and (co) variance of the species concentrations. We use streamline coordinates to reduce the dimensionality of the PDF/CDF equations and, hence, the computational effort of solving them. For the sake of completeness, we also present similar equations in Cartesian coordinates. By providing a complete probabilistic description of species concentrations at the bedform scale, our PDF/CDF equations allow one to evaluate the impact of random spatiotemporal variability in the inputs on the DIN dynamics. They yield physically based prior distributions for data assimilation and can be deployed to guide measurement campaigns by identifying regions with the largest predictive uncertainty.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000442502100014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DProbabilistic%2BForecasting%2Bof%2BNitrogen%2BDynamics%2Bin%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DFrancesca%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DBoso%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR022525%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4431%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4417-4431%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4417%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DBoso%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DMarzadri%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DTartakovsky%252C%2BDM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

An investigation was made into the connections between ecosystem function and hydraulic structure of a stream impacted by gravel mining operations in western New York. Stream ecosystem metabolic parameters were measured using two-point dissolved oxygen diurnals on multiple reaches of the same stream, and were correlated with geomorphic and hydraulic descriptors of the same reaches. Results showed ecosystem metabolism at the reach scale varied as a function of geomorphic condition, where higher primary production and community respiration (CR) were observed for reaches observed to be unstable vs. those that were stable or restored. The metabolic variance of a stream ecosystem, proposed as a measure of the degree to which a desired ecological functional goal has been achieved post-restoration, is determined as the rate of change of the ratio of primary production to CR. Shifts in the P/R ratio were evident in reaches post-restoration, presumably as a result of changes in hydraulic structure, supporting the utility of the ratio by describing a direct link between instream hydraulic conditions and ecosystem function.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000470033600008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMetabolic%2BVariance%253A%2BA%2BMetric%2Bto%2BDetect%2BShifts%2Bin%2BStream%2BEcosystem%2BFunction%2Bas%2Ba%2BResult%2Bof%2BStream%2BRestoration%26rft.aufirst%3DStacey%2BSloan%26rft.auinit%3DSS%26rft.aulast%3DBlersch%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.12753%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D621%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D608-621%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D608%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DBlersch%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DBlersch%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DAtkinson%252C%2BJF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
28,"Chaput-Bardy, A",Dec 24 2009 ,Modelling the effect of in-stream and overland dispersal on gene flow in river networks,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Modelling gene flow across natural landscapes is a current challenge of population genetics. Models are essential to make clear predictions about conditions that cause genetic differentiation or maintain connectivity between populations. River networks are a special case of landscape matrix. They represent stretches of habitat connected according to a branching pattern where dispersal is usually limited to upstream or downstream movements. Because of their peculiar topology, and the increasing concern about conservation issues in hydrosystems, there has been a recent revival of interest in modelling dispersal in river networks. Network complexity has been shown to influence global population differentiation. However, geometric characteristics are likely to interact with the way individuals move across space. Studies have focused on in-stream movements. None of the work published so far took into consideration the ability of many species to disperse overland between branches of the same network though. We predicted that the relative contribution of these two dispersal modalities (in-stream and overland) would affect the overall genetic structure. We simulated dispersal in synthetic river networks using an individual-based model. We tested the effect of dispersal modalities, i.e. the ratio of overland/in-stream dispersal, and two geometric parameters, bifurcation angle between branches and network complexity. Data revealed that if geometrical parameters affected population differentiation, dispersal parameters had the strongest effect. Interestingly, we observed a quadratic relationship between p the proportion of overland dispersers and population differentiation. We interpret this U-shape pattern as a balance between isolation by distance caused by in-stream movements at low values of p and intense migrant exchanges within the same branching unit at high values of p. Our study is the first attempt to model out-of-network movements. It clearly shows that both geometric and dispersal parameters interact. Both should be taken into consideration in order to refine predictions about dispersal and gene flow in river network. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

29,"Fida, Z",Mar 1 2021 ,Reduction of excess sludge production by membrane bioreactor coupled with anoxic side-stream reactors,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"While cleaning wastewater, biological wastewater treatment processes such as membrane bioreactors (MBR) produce a significant amount of sludge that requires costly management. In the oxic-settling-anoxic (OSA) process, sludge is retained for a temporary period in side-stream reactors with low oxygen and substrate, and then it is recirculated to the main reactor. In this way, excess sludge production is reduced. We studied the influence of the rate of sludge exchange between MBR and side-stream anoxic reactors on sludge yield reduction within MBR. Two MBRs, namely, MBROSA and MBRcontrol, each coupled with separate external anoxic side-stream reactors, were run in parallel for 350 days. Unlike MBRcontrol, MBROSA had sludge exchange with the external reactors connected to it. During the investigation over a sludge interchange rate (SIR) range of 0-22%, an SIR of 11% achieved the highest sludge reduction (58%). Greater volatile solids destruction i.e., bacterial cell lysis and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) destruction occurred at the SIR of 11%, which helped to achieve the highest sludge reduction. The enhanced volatile solids destruction was evident by the release of nutrients in the external anoxic reactors. It was confirmed that the sludge yield reduction was achieved without compromising the wastewater treatment quality, sludge settleability and hydraulic performance of the membrane in MBR.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000618047600012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B111919%26rft.atitle%3DReduction%2Bof%2Bexcess%2Bsludge%2Bproduction%2Bby%2Bmembrane%2Bbioreactor%2Bcoupled%2Bwith%2Banoxic%2Bside-stream%2Breactors%26rft.aufirst%3DZulqarnain%26rft.auinit%3DZ%26rft.aulast%3DFida%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jenvman.2020.111919%26rft.eissn%3D1095-8630%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0301-4797%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BMANAGE%26rft.volume%3D281%26rft.au%3DFida%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DPrice%252C%2BWE%26rft.au%3DHai%252C%2BFI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

This study evaluates the concentrations of PGE in stream sediments of the Hex River, which drains the mining area of the Bushveld Igneous Complex (South Africa), at four sampling points. Major, minor and trace elements (Fe, Ca, Al, Mg, Mn, V, Cr, Zn, Cu, As, Co, Ni, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed by FMS and ETAAS in suspended particulate matter and different sediment fractions (<63, 63-500 and 500-2000 mu m), and Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir were measured by ICP-MS after removal of interfering elements (cation exchange resin 50W-DOWEX-X8). Procedures were blank-corrected and accuracy checked using reference materials. Nickel, Cr, Pt, Pd, Rh and Ir show concentrations 3-, 13- 18-, 28, 48- and 44- fold the typical upper continental crust levels, respectively, although lower than concentrations reported for the parent rocks. The highest concentrations were observed closer to the mining area, decreasing with distance and in the <63 gm fraction, probably derived from atmospheric deposition and surface runoff of PGE-rich particles released from mining activities.Thus, mining activities are causing some disturbance of the surface PGE geochemical cycle, increasing the presence of PGE in the fine fraction of river sediments. We propose that indicators such as airborne particulate matter, and soil and river sediment quality, should be added to the protocols for evaluating the sustainability of mining activities.

This study applied the super efficiency slacks-based measure to calculate the regional differences and evolution characteristics of the YREB's CE from the year of 2006 to 2017. It also constructed a coupling evaluation model to empirically analyze the interactions between CE and technology absorptive capacity (TAC). The results showed that (1) the CE for all YREB provinces followed a ""U-shaped"" trend. TAC generally increased and incrementally decreased in the sequence of the upper stream, middle stream, and downstream. The gap among the downstream, upper stream, and middle stream increased; (2) coupling between the CE and TAC for the YREB provinces can be characterized as a relatively stable medium to low coupling degree and medium-to-high coordination degree. To improve coupling and achieve balanced, sustainable development in the YREB, this study proposes several measures, including promoting balanced, high-quality economic development, building the YREB talent pool, appropriately guiding foreign capital flows, implementing the strategy of driving economic development through innovation, and launching the network for coordinated technological innovation in YREB.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000586746700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B8010%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bbetween%2BCarbon%2BEfficiency%2Band%2BTechnology%2BAbsorptive%2BCapacity-A%2BCase%2BStudy%2Bof%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaoming%26rft.auinit%3DXM%26rft.aulast%3DJiang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fsu12198010%26rft.eissn%3D2071-1050%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BXM%26rft.au%3DZheng%252C%2BCY%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BWJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The Qingshui River Basin (QRB), as the main sediment source tributary of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, is characterized by spatial heterogeneity of rainfall, vegetation, and soil erosion. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations of sediment yields within the QRB and further identified the coupling effects of precipitation and vegetation on soil erosion. We collected annual (1955 to 2016) and daily (2006 to 2016) hydrological and sediment series from six hydrological stations, which subdivided the whole basin into six different sub-basins with heterogeneity in climate and landscape. Variations in parameter a of the sediment rating curves among the six sub-basins continuously declined, showing the continuously increasing effect of vegetation coverage on reducing soil erosion. The unique combination of relationships between precipitation characteristics and vegetation patterns in six sub-basins and these coupling effects resulted in different precipitation-vegetation-erosion patterns in six sub-basins. Sediment yield followed bell-shaped relationships with vegetation and precipitation, with a clear critical threshold at normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) = 0.36/precipitation = 100 mm at a monthly scale. Based on these thresholds, the non-linear relationships between precipitation, vegetation, and erosion were also explained. We also found that reducing the time lags in which vegetation follows precipitation may be effective in suppressing sediment yield. These findings could provide a quantitative approach to estimating the potential changes in sediment yield associated with proposed ecological rehabilitation schemes in this region.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000775475200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B396%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BEffects%2Bof%2BPrecipitation%2Band%2BVegetation%2Bon%2BSediment%2BYield%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BPerspective%2Bof%2BSpatiotemporal%2BHeterogeneity%2Bacross%2Bthe%2BQingshui%2BRiver%2BBasin%2Bof%2Bthe%2BUpper%2BYellow%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DJun%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DYang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Ff13030396%26rft.eissn%3D1999-4907%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFORESTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFORESTS%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BHL%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BWQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=FORESTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

35,"Kaleris, V",1998 ,Quantifying the exchange rate between groundwater and small streams,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH,"The reliability of quantification (measurement and calculation) of the exchange rate between groundwater and small streams is discussed. Concerning measurements, two measuring techniques (discharge difference measurements and seepage meter measurements) are investigated. Discharge difference measurements can give reliable results if the length of the reach, at the ends of which the discharge is measured, is appropriate. Infiltrometer measurements are of questionable value when influenced by difficult to detect installation errors. Concerning calculations the following issues are addressed:(a) The sensitivity of the calculated values of the exchange rate to errors in various parameters. This problem is discussed by means of analytical solutions; The analysis shows that, in case of stream beds with relatively small hydraulic resistance, errors in the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer are important for the exchange rate. In case of stream beds with high hydraulic resistance, exchange rate is strongly influenced by the errors in the hydraulic resistance. In such cases, errors in the parameters characterizing the capillary forces in the porous media can increase the resulting errors considerably.(b) The reliability of estimations of the hydraulic resistance of the stream bed by means of piezometric head measurements near the stream. Investigations in a small stream show that, if the hydraulic resistance of the stream bed is high, its estimation from measurements of the piezometric heads is uncertain.(c) The forecasting of the exchange rate by means of depth integrated models under a hydrologic regime other than the one used for calibration. By means of analytical solutions it is shown that in case of stream beds with high hydraulic resistance and for porous materials in which the capillary forces are negligible, the exchange coefficient used to describe the exchange flow includes only the influence of the clogging layer. In such cases the value of the exchange coefficient estimated from the calibration can be used to forecast the exchange rate under changed hydrological conditions. In cases where the hydraulic resistance of the stream bed is small and for materials with nonnegligible capillary forces, such forecasting can be erroneous.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000077546800005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bthe%2Bexchange%2Brate%2Bbetween%2Bgroundwater%2Band%2Bsmall%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DVassilios%2BK.%26rft.auinit%3DV%26rft.aulast%3DKaleris%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F00221689809498593%26rft.epage%3D932%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1686%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D913-932%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D913%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D36&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
36,"Potter, JD",Oct 2014 ,Incorporating urban infrastructure into biogeochemical assessment of urban tropical streams in Puerto Rico,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"The influence of built urban infrastructure on stream chemistry was quantified throughout the drainage network of the tropical Rio Piedras watershed, San Juan metropolitan area, Puerto Rico. Urbanization and failing domestic wastewater infrastructure appeared to drive changes in surface water chemistry throughout the watershed. Mean baseflow concentrations of chloride (Cl), ammonium (NH4), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and phosphate (PO4) all increased with urban infrastructure, while nitrate (NO3) and dissolved oxygen (DO) decreased. These patterns in stream chemistry suggest that sewage effluent from failing or illegally connected sewer pipes has a major impact on surface water quality. Concentrations of Cl, DO, and NH4 in stream water were most strongly related to sewer pipe volume, demonstrating the tight connection between urban infrastructure and stream chemistry. The loading and transformation of NO3 and NH4 were modeled along the river network and NH4 loading rates from the landscape were strongly related to urban infrastructure, whereas NO3 loading rates showed only weak relationships, highlighting the importance for incorporating NH4 dynamics into river network models in urban environments. Water quality appears to be severely impacted by sewage in this tropical basin, despite large investments in built infrastructure. The high temperatures in the Rio Piedras exacerbate water quality problems by reducing saturation DO levels in streams, and intense rainstorms tax the ability of built infrastructure to adequately manage overland flows. These problems are likely typical of much of the urbanized humid tropics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000341908600014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIncorporating%2Burban%2Binfrastructure%2Binto%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bassessment%2Bof%2Burban%2Btropical%2Bstreams%2Bin%2BPuerto%2BRico%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DPotter%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-013-9914-5%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D286%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D271-286%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D271%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D121%26rft.au%3DPotter%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DMcDowell%252C%2BWH%26rft.au%3DDaley%252C%2BML&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

This paper describes a methodology that yields a 1 month ahead forecast of stream flow using wavelets based multiscale nonlinear models. The method uses the multi resolution decomposition capability of wavelets to obtain corresponding scale specific features of the underlying generating system and the reconstruction of the given time series is accomplished by linking together the derived decompositions using second order Volterra kernels which are estimated in an online mode using the well known Kalman filter formulation. The model has been applied to two case studies from Cauvery River Basin, India. Results also indicate presence of discernable nonlinear characteristics in the stream flow data as evidenced by the results of the BDS non-linearity test. The proposed model performed well for both the stations when compared to the Wavelet based Linear models, the linear regression models and other nonlinear approaches such as the coupled Wavelets-Artificial Neural Networks based models.

The coupled model, SWAT_FEM was applied to assess the hydrology of the Chennai River basin in India, a coastal zone with significant irrigation. The SWAT_FEM enhanced the predictions of stream flows and ground water levels (R-2:0.69,0.81; Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE):0.64,0.74) compared to the standalone model, SWAT (R-2:0.64,0.66; NSE:0.60,0.63) respectively. The coupled model produced an all-inclusive representation of the impacts of management practices on the hydrological processes and generated insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of the surface water and ground water interactions in the study area. The results showed that the interactions of surface water and ground water were significant in the mainstream of Chennai River basin. The seasonal ground water levels obtained with the SWAT_FEM model reinforced the increases in exorbitant ground water abstraction rates (9%-44%) with the introduction of management practices including reservoirs, pond irrigation, and agricultural water use. The results emphasized that if the ground water demand continued to increase, accelerated and unregulated ground water extraction is bound to happen shortly to suffice the water use, which can bring about environmental problems to this basin. Overall, this study demonstrated the applicability of the SWAT_FEM model and its value to the water resources management in irrigated areas with management practices. The developed model can be utilized in water resources assessment tools for effective predictions of ground water contributions in river basins.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000660835700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2BSurface%2BWater%2Band%2BGround%2BWater%2BInteractions%2Busing%2Ba%2BCoupled%2BSWAT_FEM%2BModel%253A%2BImplications%2Bof%2BManagement%2BPractices%2Bon%2BHydrological%2BProcesses%2Bin%2BIrrigated%2BRiver%2BBasins%26rft.aufirst%3DPooja%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DPP%26rft.aulast%3DPreetha%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-021-02867-7%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1650%26rft.epage%3D2797%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2781-2797%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2781%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DPreetha%252C%2BPP%26rft.au%3DJoseph%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DNarasimhan%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Study focus: A year-long field campaign from July 2018 to July 2019 measured steady and dynamic stream-aquifer exchanges on Ichawaynochaway Creek (INC), a fifth-order tributary to the karstic Flint River in Georgia. The net change in discharge along a 24-km Creek segment was determined between two US Geological Survey gaging stations with no surface-water inflows. Stream-aquifer interactions were measured along a 120-m piezometer transect perpendicular to the bank. Hydraulic parameters to aid future modeling efforts were estimated using the method of moments applied to changes in bank flow direction from Hurricane Michael. New hydrological insights for the region: Results display the effects of local water use on streamflow as most channel storage gains occurred in the fall and winter. Negligible net channel gains and some losses occurred during the spring and summer months. Approximately 150 million m3 of net channel gains were observed during the study period. Initial stormflow contributed to aquifer recharge as indicated by reversals in the hydraulic gradient. Diffusivity and transmissivity increased along the transect (9-420 m(2)/d) and (3-150 m(2)/d), respectively, and hydraulic conductivity equaled 2.85 m/d. Stream-reach orientation with respect to regional groundwater gradients explains increased stream-aquifer interactions.

40,"Yun, WJ",Feb 2022 ,Quality-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Streaming in Infrastructure-Assisted Connected Vehicles,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY,"This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based video streaming scheme for mobility-aware vehicular networks, e.g., vehicles on the highway. We consider infrastructure-assisted and mmWave-based scenarios in which the macro base station (MBS) cannot directly provide the streaming service to vehicles due to the short range of mmWave beams so that small mmWave base stations (mBSs) along the road deliver the desired videos to users. Motivated by the fact that a video stream consists of sequential chunks and smooth streaming has to be provided while users pass through multiple mBSs at high speed, the MBS proactively pushes some video chunks of the desired contents to mBSs. This is done to support vehicles that are currently covered and/or will be by each mBS. We formulate the dynamic video delivery scheme that adaptively determines 1) which content, 2) what quality and 3) how many chunks to be proactively delivered from the MBS to mBSs using Markov decision process (MDP). Since it is difficult for the MBS to track all the channel conditions and the network states have extensive dimensions, we adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for the DRL-based video delivery scheme. This paper finally shows that the DRL agentlearns a streaming policy that pursues high average quality while limiting packet drops, avoiding playback stalls, reducing quality fluctuations and saving backhaul usage.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000756861400071,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuality-Aware%2BDeep%2BReinforcement%2BLearning%2Bfor%2BStreaming%2Bin%2BInfrastructure-Assisted%2BConnected%2BVehicles%26rft.aufirst%3DWon%2BJoon%26rft.auinit%3DWJ%26rft.aulast%3DYun%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTVT.2021.3134457%26rft.eissn%3D1939-9359%26rft.epage%3D2017%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-9545%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BVEHICULAR%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2002-2017%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2002%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BVEH%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D71%26rft.au%3DYun%252C%2BWJ%26rft.au%3DKwon%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DMolisch%252C%2BAF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+VEHICULAR+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Xie, ZQ",Jun 2015 ,"Improving the forecast precision of river stage spatial and temporal distribution using drain pipeline knowledge coupled with BP artificial neural networks: a case study of Panlong River, Kunming, China",NATURAL HAZARDS,"Artificial neural network technologies are frequently used in flood disaster simulations to aid regional disaster analyses. However, despite being an important factor that affects urban waterlogging, urban underground pipeline knowledge is seldom coupled with artificial neural networks or applied to urban waterlogging simulations. This article presents a simulation of urban waterlogging that utilises professional knowledge of urban underground drain pipelines coupled with BP artificial neural networks. Using this method, actual input weights are computed to simulate the river stage variations in the Panlong River of Kunming, China, for 35 consecutive hours during a heavy rainstorm that took place on 19 July 2013. The artificial neural network is coupled with drain pipeline knowledge, and river stage variations during this heavy rainfall are successfully simulated. The study results indicate that, in comparison with traditional BP neural network simulation methods, the use of knowledge of urban drain pipelines coupled with artificial neural networks yields more precise forecasting results for the urban river stage, with 85.7 % of all simulated river stage values corresponding closely with observed values. To support decision-making based on urban waterlogging forecasts, a map showing the impact distribution of the maximum river stage of Panlong River on the day of field study is provided. The results of the simulations show that the predicted locations of river water overflow were similar to the observed locations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000353803700030,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImproving%2Bthe%2Bforecast%2Bprecision%2Bof%2Briver%2Bstage%2Bspatial%2Band%2Btemporal%2Bdistribution%2Busing%2Bdrain%2Bpipeline%2Bknowledge%2Bcoupled%2Bwith%2BBP%2Bartificial%2Bneural%2Bnetworks%253A%2Ba%2Bcase%2Bstudy%2Bof%2BPanlong%2BRiver%252C%2BKunming%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DZhiqiang%26rft.auinit%3DZQ%26rft.aulast%3DXie%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11069-015-1648-3%26rft.eissn%3D1573-0840%26rft.epage%3D1102%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0921-030X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURAL%2BHAZARDS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1081-1102%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1081%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BHAZARDS%26rft.volume%3D77%26rft.au%3DXie%252C%2BZQ%26rft.au%3DDu%252C%2BQY%26rft.au%3DJamiesone%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=NATURAL+HAZARDS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

From the results obtained by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), it was concluded that the sediments of Drini i Bardhe River are weathering products of sandstones; the sediments of Morava e Binces, Sitnica and of the upper course of Lepenc are weathering products of magmatic rocks and sandstones; the sediments of the lower stretch of Lepenc are weathering products of magmatic rocks, sandstones and carbonates. The concentration of major and minor elements was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), the amounts of P and S by inductively coupled plasma in combination with optical emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES), and the amounts of Hg by cold vapor in combination with adsorption atomic spectroscopy (CV-AAS). Assessment of sediment contamination with toxic elements was performed by comparison with the existing criteria for sediment quality. Results obtained by the box plot method showed the regions with determined anomalous element concentration values in stream sediments of Kosovo. Two locations in Sitnica River at Fushe Kosova (Kosovo Poije) and Mitrovica are significantly polluted as a result of Zn and Pb ore processing and Zn electrolysis. In the lower course of Morava River, sediments are contaminated with Cd. Increased concentrations of Mn were observed near the source of Drini i Bardhe River, suggesting natural origin. Continuation of sediment monitoring is recommended, particularly on Sitnica and Morava rivers, which flow through Serbia to enter ultimately the Black Sea.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000269855800011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DANALYSIS%2BOF%2BSEDIMENTS%2BOF%2BTHE%2BFOUR%2BMAIN%2BRIVERS%2B%2528DRINI%2BI%2BBARDHE%252C%2BMORAVA%2BE%2BBINCES%252C%2BLEPENC%2BAND%2BSITNICA%2529%2BIN%2BKOSOVO%26rft.aufirst%3DFatbardh%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DGashi%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft.eissn%3D1610-2304%26rft.epage%3D1471%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1018-4619%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESENIUS%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BBULLETIN%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1462-1471%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1462%26rft.stitle%3DFRESEN%2BENVIRON%2BBULL%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DGashi%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DFranciskovic-Bilinski%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DBilinski%252C%2BH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=FRESENIUS+ENVIRONMENTAL+BULLETIN&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

This study explores the coupling relationship between green production and green consumption by setting up a coupling coordination degree model using 2006-2015 panel data for the Yangtze River Delta area. The results highlight that, first, the contribution rate of the tertiary industry to the gross domestic product index is the key factor influencing green production. Meanwhile, passenger volume in the public traffic index is the main factor impacting green consumption. Second, while both green production and consumption levels have somewhat improved in the area, the gap between them continues to widen. Furthermore, the improvement in green consumption lags behind that in green production. Finally, the coupling coordination degree between green production and consumption in the area shows an increasing trend, although at a low level. These findings suggest that governments should focus on improving green consumption to increase the coupling coordination degree.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000514452300009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be12239%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Brelationship%2Bbetween%2Bgreen%2Bproduction%2Band%2Bgreen%2Bconsumption%253A%2BCase%2Bof%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BDelta%2Barea%26rft.aufirst%3DYongchang%26rft.auinit%3DYC%26rft.aulast%3DShen%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fnrm.12239%26rft.eissn%3D1939-7445%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0890-8575%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURAL%2BRESOURCE%2BMODELING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BRESOUR%2BMODEL%26rft.volume%3D33%26rft.au%3DShen%252C%2BYC%26rft.au%3DFu%252C%2BYY%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BML&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=NATURAL+RESOURCE+MODELING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
44,"Westhoff, MC",2011 ,"Quantifying spatial and temporal discharge dynamics of an event in a first order stream, using distributed temperature sensing",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Understanding the spatial distribution of discharge can be important for water quality and quantity modeling. Non-steady flood waves can, particularly as a result of short high intensity summer rainstorms, influence small headwater streams significantly. The aim of this paper is to quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of stream flow in a headwater stream during a summer rainstorm. These dynamics include gains and losses of stream water, the effect of bypasses that become active and hyporheic exchange fluxes that may vary over time as a function of discharge. We use an advection-dispersion model coupled with an energy balance model to simulate in-stream water temperature, which we compare with high resolution temperature observations obtained with Distributed Temperature Sensing. This model was used as a learning tool to stepwise unravel the complex puzzle of in-stream processes subject to varying discharge. Hypotheses were tested and rejected, which led to more insight in the spatial and temporal dynamics in discharge and hyporheic exchange processes. We showed that, for the studied stream infiltration losses increase during a small rain event, while gains of water remained constant over time. We conclude that, eventually, part of the stream water bypassed the main channel during peak discharge. It also seems that hyporheic exchange varies with varying discharge in the first 250m of the stream; while further downstream it remains constant. Because we relied on solar radiation as the main energy input, we were only able to apply this method during a small summer storm and low flow conditions.

45,"Nkandeu, YK",May 2022 ,Image encryption using the logistic map coupled to a self-synchronizing streaming,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,"A large number of image encryption algorithms have been proposed in recent years to solve security challenges associated with multimedia communications. Thanks to its simplicity, the logistic map (LM) was abundantly used in the design of these ciphers. However, a careful analysis of the LM reveals that it exhibits weaknesses such as a periodicity in some sequences of numbers it generates, coupled to the short interval of its control parameters. These drawbacks weaken LM-based ciphers. In this paper, we have designed a robust cryptosystem based on the LM coupled to a self-synchronous stream cipher mode, using an external 256-bit key, and operating in a diffusion and permutation round. In this cipher, the secret key is transformed and used to compute values of initial conditions, control parameter values and some other elements needed for encryption. The technique used made up for the LM shortcomings and yielded a more robust cipher as far as cryptanalysis is concerned. An average NCPR of 99.62 and UACI of 33.53 with a keyspace of 10(144), and an entropy of 7.9994 coupled to an average correlation of 0.003 were obtained during the cryptosystem evaluation.

The method employs a cation-exchange membrane to separate metal cations from their complexes; both total and cationic forms of metals were determined by means of GFAAS. The sensitivity of the method for the measurement of trace metal cations is determined by the detection limits of GFAAS for the metals of interest. Comparable concentrations of metal cations in water from NBS and from the Erhjen river were obtained between the DME-GFAAS and calculated (WATEQ4F) methods, indicating that the developed method is promising for natural fresh waters. The effect of pH on the distribution of metal cation in the NBS river water is significant for Cu and Pb; concentrations of these cations increase with decreasing pH. However, the concentrations of Cd and Zn cations do not vary with pH except that the concentration of the Zn cation decreases significantly as the pH value increases beyond 9.

48,"Luo, JC",Dec 2019 ,Large spatiotemporal shifts of CO2 partial pressure and CO2 degassing in a monsoonal headwater stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from rivers are a vital part of the global carbon budget. However, data from subtropical areas, especially in the headwater streams, are scare. Spatiotemporal dynamics and drives of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and water-air CO2 fluxes (FCO2) in a monsoonal headwater stream Jinshui River of the Yangtze were unraveled. Our findings suggested that natural process (i.e., hydrology, CO2 outgassing and lithology) and human activities were recognized as significant players in regulating the variability of riverine pCO(2). The mean pCO(2) was significantly higher in the dry season (1562 +/- 975 mu atm) than the wet season (834 +/- 639 mu atm), seasonal trends of pCO(2) were controlled by in situ biogenic activities and rainfall events. The slight fluctuations of pCO(2) from upstream to downstream along main stem implied the mixed influences of distinct water environments and anthropogenic disturbance. Correlation analysis showed that environmental factors, i.e., temperature, pH, TN and DOC were relevant to pronounced spatial and seasonal variability of pCO(2). We highlighted that high water-air CO2 flux was estimated at 343 +/- 413 mmol/m(2/)d (dry: 542 +/- 477 mmol/m(2/)d vs wet: 192 +/- 278 mmol/m (2/)d) in the monsoonal headwater stream, and the watershed-scale carbon budget demonstrated carbon loss via atmospheric exchange was 1.2 times the riverine dissolved carbon export. Our results would fill a large gap in the headwater stream of the Yangtze, and help to accurately estimate the regional to global CO2 outgassing from rivers to the atmosphere.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000500371200006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124135%26rft.atitle%3DLarge%2Bspatiotemporal%2Bshifts%2Bof%2BCO2%2Bpartial%2Bpressure%2Band%2BCO2%2Bdegassing%2Bin%2Ba%2Bmonsoonal%2Bheadwater%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DJiachen%26rft.auinit%3DJC%26rft.aulast%3DLuo%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2019.124135%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D579%26rft.au%3DLuo%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BSY%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD4bZsvxLjVPiIfLsse0qz&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Helton, AM",Jan 15 2014 ,"Relative influences of the river channel, floodplain surface, and alluvial aquifer on simulated hydrologic residence time in a montane river floodplain",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Current methods for characterizing the influence of geomorphic structure on river processes are not well suited for study of large rivers with extensive hydrologic exchanges between the channel, floodplain surface, and alluvial aquifer. Here we applied a spatially explicit, three-dimensional hydrologic model to simulate surface and subsurface flow within the 16-km(2) Nyack Floodplain on the Middle Fork Flathead River in northwest Montana, USA. We ran the model for four years and simulated nine conservative particle releases across a range of river discharges. Our objective was to evaluate the interactions of hydrologic dynamics and floodplain structure in determining the residence time of water in the system. Particle tracking simulations revealed when river discharge was below bankfull, mean residence time of surface water decreased with river discharge. During overbank flows, however, mean residence time increased with discharge because of surface water storage on the floodplain. When surface and subsurface water were considered, mean hydrologic residence time was more than an order of magnitude greater than the residence time of surface water alone because of storage in the alluvial aquifer. Residence time also decreased exponentially with river discharge, because a smaller percentage of surface water entered the subsurface at high discharges. Our analyses illustrate the importance of considering in-channel flow, floodwater storage, and surface-subsurface exchange in determining the overall residence time of water within a river segment, especially in floodplain environments.
