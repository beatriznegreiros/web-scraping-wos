0,"Chabela, LP",Aug 2019 ,"Relationship between Peak Stage, Storm Duration, and Bank Storage along a Meandering Stream",WATER,"Groundwater and surface water are often studied as different systems; however, one commonly affects the other. Bank storage, the temporary storage and release of stream water in adjacent aquifers, can contribute a considerable amount of discharge to a river and can be a component in the transport and fate of a contaminant. Studies document the effects of increasing stage and increasing storm duration; however, these controls are often investigated separately. This project examined which factor, peak stage or storm duration, was more influential on the bank-storage process. The study focused on a small reach of a third-order, meandering, perennial stream. A 3-D, transient-state numerical model (MODFLOW) was created of the study site, and 36 simulations were run at various peak stages and storm durations. Peak stage and storm durations, while both influential, affected different areas of the bank-storage process. Peak stage was statistically more influential in controlling the maximum volume of bank storage (3.6x) and the volume of the storage that remained in the system at 100 h (1.1x). Longer storm duration generated a slower return of water, thus increasing the retention of bank storage. Parafluvial exchange was an important factor in bank storage along a meandering stream, suggesting that at least 2-D, ideally 3-D, models need to be employed in evaluating bank storage.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000484561500161,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1688%26rft.atitle%3DRelationship%2Bbetween%2BPeak%2BStage%252C%2BStorm%2BDuration%252C%2Band%2BBank%2BStorage%2Balong%2Ba%2BMeandering%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DLucas%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DLP%26rft.aulast%3DChabela%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw11081688%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DChabela%252C%2BLP%26rft.au%3DPeterson%252C%2BEW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Kelleher, C",Feb 28 2012 ,Investigating controls on the thermal sensitivity of Pennsylvania streams,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream temperature, an important measure of ecosystem health, is expected to be altered by future changes in climate and land use, potentially leading to shifts in habitat distribution for aquatic organisms dependent on particular temperature regimes. To assess the sensitivity of stream temperature to change in a region where such a shift has the potential to occur, we examine the variability of and controls on the direct relationship between air and water temperature across the state of Pennsylvania. We characterized the relationship between air and stream temperature via linear and nonlinear regression for 57 sites across Pennsylvania at daily and weekly timescales. Model fit (r2) improved for 92% (daily) and 65% (weekly) of sites for nonlinear versus linear relationships. Fit for weekly versus daily regression analysis improved by 0.08 for linear and 0.06 for nonlinear regression relationships. To investigate the mechanisms controlling stream temperature sensitivity to environmental change, we define thermal sensitivity as the sensitivity of stream temperature of a given site to change in air temperature, quantified as the slope of the regression line between air and stream temperature. Air temperature accounted for 6095% of the daily variation in stream temperature for sites at or above a Strahler stream order (SO) of 3, with thermal sensitivities ranging from low (0.02) to high (0.93). The sensitivity of stream temperature to air temperature is primarily controlled by stream size (SO) and baseflow contribution. Together, SO and baseflow index explained 43% of the variance in thermal sensitivity across the state, and 59% within the Susquehanna River Basin. In small streams, baseflow contribution was the major determinant of thermal sensitivity, with increasing baseflow contributions resulting in decreasing sensitivity values. In large streams, thermal sensitivity increased with stream size, as a function of accumulated heat throughout the stream network.

2,"Hoellein, TJ",Nov 2012 ,EFFECTS OF BENTHIC HABITAT RESTORATION ON NUTRIENT UPTAKE AND ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM IN THREE HEADWATER STREAMS,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The assemblage of stream habitat types can drive biofilm composition and activity in headwater streams, thereby influencing rates of ecosystem function. However, the influence of human-induced alterations to the distribution of benthic habitat such as construction, land-use changes and restoration on biofilm-mediated processes has not been well studied. We measured nutrient uptake of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate, as well as gross primary production and community respiration in three streams in Michigan, USA, each with an upstream reference and a downstream restored reach. The restoration included a 10-m sediment trap, paired with 4060?m of gravel and boulder added downstream and designed to retain sediment, stabilize banks and provide spawning habitat for trout. We sampled four times in the six stream reaches from May 2006 to September 2007. Across streams, restored reaches reflected the structural manipulation with increased predominance of coarse inorganic sediments, higher gas exchange rate and increased transient storage. However, nutrient uptake and community respiration rates were different between reaches at only one site. The ecosystem response by this stream was driven by the large differences in coarse inorganic habitat between reference and restored reaches. We conclude that restorations of benthic habitat which are visually conspicuous, such as creation of settling pools and gravel-filled reaches, did not universally affect stream ecosystem function. Initial conditions and magnitude of change may be key factors to consider in explaining functional responses, and predicting the influence of habitat restoration on ecosystem function remains a challenge.

3,"Kim, H",Jun 2014 ,Factors Controlling Sediment Denitrification Rates in Grassland and Forest Streams,TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES,"Sediment denitrification is an important nitrate (NO3-) removal process from agricultural streams. The direct and indirect factors that control denitrification rates in tributary sediments can vary depending on the types of agricultural activities and vegetation. Our research investigated (1) tributary sediment denitrification rates in a grassland stream affected by pasture ecosystems and a forest stream affected by N fertilization; and (2) the environmental factors that determine denitrification rates in tributary sediments. The denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in grassland stream sediments is positively correlated with precipitation likely due to the increased nutrient exchange rates between stream water and sediments, and was higher than in forest stream sediments, leading to a decrease in NO3- concentration ([NO3-]) in stream sediments. The DEA in riparian sediments was regulated by carbon concentrations and did not contribute to NO3- removal from the riparian sediment in grassland and forest streams. Thus, environmental factors affected by different types of agricultural activities and vegetation might regulate denitrification rates and [NO3-] in agricultural stream ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000336884000011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFactors%2BControlling%2BSediment%2BDenitrification%2BRates%2Bin%2BGrassland%2Band%2BForest%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DHaryun%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DKim%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3319%252FTAO.2014.01.09.01%2528Hy%2529%26rft.epage%3D470%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1017-0839%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DTERRESTRIAL%2BATMOSPHERIC%2BAND%2BOCEANIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D463-470%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D463%26rft.stitle%3DTERR%2BATMOS%2BOCEAN%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D25&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=TERRESTRIAL+ATMOSPHERIC+AND+OCEANIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Roh, P",May 2019 ,"Information stream mapping: Mapping, analysing and improving the efficiency of information streams in manufacturing value streams",CIRP JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"Inaccurate, incomplete and late information limits the capability and efficiency of production systems. In this paper, a structured approach is proposed for analysing and improving information streams to mitigate this problem. The improvement of information streams is especially demanding as production environments increase in complexity, for example due to higher product variety, more complex products, and accordingly, more sophisticated manufacturing processes. A novel method is introduced that enables an analysis similar to value stream mapping, but particularly for information streams in a production environment. The proposed approach improves information streams by mapping and analysing the characteristics of them. Therefore, five performance indicators are developed to comparably assess the current state of information streams. The approach was tested and validated on a shop floor of a producer of sanitary products. The validation shows that the proposed information stream mapping method could efficiently highlight improvement potentials of information streams on the shop floor and thus the ability of the method to improve the overall productivity. In a first application it is shown that the taken measures are expected to reduce the lead time from five days to four hours. In a second application, the personal cost of a tool exchange is reduced by 8%.

It is based on the direct complexation of mercury ions using iodide and a cationic surfactant in water for its subsequent solid-phase extraction. Mercury ions are retained on the silica phase as ion pairs in the presence of iodide ions and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide. Parameters having influential influence on the retention of Hg(II) were investigated: sample flowrate, eluent type, sample volume, iodide and surfactant concentrations. The retained mercury ions are stripped off from silica phase using 10 mL of 8 mol L-1 HNO3 and quantified by ICP-MS. An enrichment factor of 50 was achieved with a maximum adsorption capacity of 718 mu g Hg(II) g(-1). The limit of detection of Hg(II) was 8 pg mL(-1).

6,"Ngo, H",Feb 2023 ,Reconstruction of the 1374 Rhine river flood event around Cologne region using 1D-2D coupled hydraulic modelling approach,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Reconstructions of the most severe historic flood events contribute to improved quantification of design dis-charges corresponding to large return periods. Reducing the uncertainty of design discharges has a great sig-nificance in constructing proper flood defences to protect the hinterland from future flooding. However, reconstructions of the peak discharges of such historic flood events are generally associated with large un-certainties, which arise from the accuracy of the historic topography, hydraulic roughness of the river channels and floodplains, and the historic hydrograph shape. This study sets up a one dimensional-two dimensional (1D-2D) coupled hydraulic model, stretching from the upstream of Bonn at Remagen to downstream of Dusseldorf, Germany, with the length of 113 km to reconstruct the maximum discharge of the 1374 flood event (Qmax,1374), which is considered to be the largest flood of the last millennium in the Lower Rhine catchment. An uncertainty analysis was performed by adopting different river bed levels and roughness values in order to estimate the influence of these uncertainties on the reconstructed peak discharge. The upstream discharge wave was varied corresponding to a wide range of peak discharges from 12,000 to 24,000 m3/s. The resulting Qmax,1374 was determined of between 14,400 and 18,500 m3/s, were then used in a flood frequency analysis to determine the design discharges corresponding to different return periods. Compared to the design discharge computed with previous estimations of the 1374 peak discharge, we found a significant reduction of 2,000 m3/s in the design discharge corresponding to a 100,000 year return period, which is the maximum safety standard adopted in the Dutch water policy for some downstream dike sections.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000915585800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B129039%26rft.atitle%3DReconstruction%2Bof%2Bthe%2B1374%2BRhine%2Briver%2Bflood%2Bevent%2Baround%2BCologne%2Bregion%2Busing%2B1D-2D%2Bcoupled%2Bhydraulic%2Bmodelling%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DHieu%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DNgo%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2022.129039%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.part%3DC%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D617%26rft.au%3DNgo%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DBomers%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DHerget%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
7,"Wang, YC",Dec 2018 ,Geocode-Based Aquatic Habitats in Hierarchical System of the Yellow River Basin,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS,"Riverine systems are primary habitats for aquatic species. Great efforts have been made to understand interaction between aquatic organism and various environmental factors in specific reaches of a river, yet little was known about how to identify habitats in river networks. In this paper, a comprehensive approach was proposed for identification of aquatic habitats in hierarchical river systems in terms of integrated geocodes synthesized through over-layer of multiple factors such as geologic periods, climatic conditions, water sources, geomorphic characteristics and river patterns. Using this approach in the Yellow River Basin over an area of 758,600 km(2), six groups of aquatic habitats were classified by clustering of 85 geocodes, and 313 sub-habitats were further identified by considering both surface composition (e.g., lithological features and soil texture) and topographic property (e.g., elevation and slope) in the loess geomorphic regions. Consequently, the contribution of the headwater streams to diversity of aquatic habitats among rivers and mid-sized rivers to the diversity within a river has been revealed by coupling of the geocode-based habitats and the river networks. The present study is of significance to efficient capture of habitat diversity and better understanding of biodiversity in rivers of different stream orders.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000453588200002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGeocode-Based%2BAquatic%2BHabitats%2Bin%2BHierarchical%2BSystem%2Bof%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BBasin%26rft.aufirst%3DY.%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DYC%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3808%252Fjei.201800386%26rft.eissn%3D1684-8799%26rft.epage%3D81%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1726-2135%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BINFORMATICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D69-81%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D69%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BINFORM%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BYC%26rft.au%3DGao%252C%2BXW%26rft.au%3DNi%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+INFORMATICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
8,"Zaramella, M",Jul 2016 ,Assessment of transient storage exchange and advection-dispersion mechanisms from concentration signatures along breakthrough curves,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Solute transport in rivers is controlled by surface flow hydrodynamics and by transient storage in dead zones, pockets of vegetation and hyporheic sediments where mass exchange and retention are governed by complex mechanisms. The physics of these processes are generally investigated by optimization of transient storage models (TSMs) to experimental data often yielding inconsistent and equifinal parameter sets. Uncertainty on parameters estimation is found to depend not only on the rates of exchange between the stream and storage zones, the stream-water velocity and the stream reach length according to the experimental Damkohler number (DaI), but also on the relative significance between transient storage and longitudinal dispersion on breakthrough curves (BTCs). An optimization strategy was developed and applied to an experimental dataset obtained from tracer tests in a small lowland river, analyzing BTCs generated through tracer injections under different conditions. The method supplies a tool to estimate model parameters from observed data through the analysis of the relative parameter significance. To analyze model performance a double compartment TSM was optimized by a regular fit procedure based on simple root mean square error minimization and by a fit based on a relative significance analysis of mechanism signatures. As a result consistent longitudinal dispersion and transient storage parameters were obtained when the signature targeted optimization was used. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

9,"Wang, YT",Jul 2017 ,Salinity Variability and Water Exchange in Interconnected Estuaries,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,"A high-resolution coastal ocean model is used to investigate salinity variability and water exchange in a complex coastal system off the southern U.S. characterized by three adjacent sounds that are interconnected by a network of channels, creeks, and intertidal areas. Model results are generally highly correlated with observations from the Georgia Coastal Ecosystem Long Term Ecological Research (GCE-LTER) program, revealing a high degree of salinity variability at the Altamaha River and Doboy Sound, decreasing sharply toward Sapelo Sound. A Lagrangian particle tracking method is used to investigate local residence time and connectivity in the system. Local residence time is highly variable, increasing with distance from the Altamaha River and decreasing with river flow, revealing that discharge plays a dominant role on transport processes and estuary-shelf exchange. The Altamaha River and Doboy Sound are connected to each other in all seasons, with exchange occurring both via coastal and estuarine pathways. While particles released at the Altamaha and Doboy rarely reach Sapelo Sound, particles released at Sapelo Sound and the creeks surrounding its main channel can reach the entire estuarine system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000402100700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSalinity%2BVariability%2Band%2BWater%2BExchange%2Bin%2BInterconnected%2BEstuaries%26rft.aufirst%3DYuntao%26rft.auinit%3DYT%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12237-016-0195-9%26rft.eissn%3D1559-2731%26rft.epage%3D929%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1559-2723%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DESTUARIES%2BAND%2BCOASTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D917-929%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D917%26rft.stitle%3DESTUAR%2BCOAST%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BYT%26rft.au%3DCastelao%252C%2BRM%26rft.au%3DDi%2BIorio%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ESTUARIES+AND+COASTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Grant, SB",May 13 2011 ,Measuring and modeling the flux of fecal bacteria across the sediment-water interface in a turbulent stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Sediments are a pervasive source of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and oceans and may constitute a long-term reservoir of human disease. Previous attempts to quantify the flux of FIB across the sediment-water interface (SWI) are limited to extreme flow events, for which the primary mechanism of bacterial release is disruption and/or erosion of the sediment substrate. Here we report measurements of FIB flux across the SWI in a turbulent stream that is not undergoing significant erosion. The stream is formed by the steady discharge of bacteria-free disinfected and highly treated wastewater effluent to an earthen channel harboring high concentrations of FIB in the sediment from in situ growth. The flux j '' of FIB across the SWI, estimated from mass balance on FIB measurements in the water column, scales linearly with the concentration of bacteria in sediment pore fluids C(pore) over a 3 decade change in both variables: j '' = k(m)(obs) C(pore). The magnitude of the observed mass transfer velocity (k(m)(obs) 5 x 10(-5) m s(-1)) is significantly larger than values predicted for either the diffusion of bacteria across a concentration boundary layer (k(m)(diff) = 8 x 10(-6) m s(-1)) or sweep and eject fluid motions at the SWI (k(m)(sweep) = 10(-6) m s(-1)) but is similar to the flux of water between the stream and its hyporheic zone estimated from dye injection experiments. These results support the hypothesis that hyporheic exchange controls the trafficking of bacteria, and perhaps other types of particulate organic matter, across the SWI in turbulent streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000290623500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW05517%26rft.atitle%3DMeasuring%2Band%2Bmodeling%2Bthe%2Bflux%2Bof%2Bfecal%2Bbacteria%2Bacross%2Bthe%2Bsediment-water%2Binterface%2Bin%2Ba%2Bturbulent%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DStanley%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DGrant%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR009460%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DGrant%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DLitton-Mueller%252C%2BRM%26rft.au%3DAhn%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

This paper first constructs an evaluation index of urban resilience and new urbanization and uses the entropy method to clarify the weights. Second, the coupling coordination degree model is used to measure the spatiotemporal differentiation characteristics of the coupling coordinated development of urban resilience and new urbanization in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2005 to 2019. The key influencing factors of the coupling coordination are analyzed using geodetectors. The results show the following. (1) The urban resilience of the Yangtze River Economic Belt has continued to improve, showing a stepwise distribution pattern of ""high in the east and low in the west"" in space. The overall development of new urbanization is at a medium-high level, with high levels concentrated in the eastern coastal cities. (2) The degree of spatial coupling and coordination between urban resilience and new urbanization is increasing year by year, and there is significant spatial heterogeneity, showing the pattern of ""high in the east and low in the west, high in the center and low in the surrounding areas"", and the type of lag is mostly urban resilience lag in new urbanization. (3) Endogenous power, external power, government power and market power interact to jointly promote the development of coupling coordination. The comprehensive effect of government power and other driving forces is the key mechanism for improving spatial coupling coordination.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000908869700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B456%26rft.atitle%3DResearch%2Bon%2BCoupling%2BCoordination%2Bof%2BChina%2527s%2BNew-Type%2BUrbanization%2Band%2BUrban%2BResilience-Taking%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%2Bas%2Ban%2BExample%26rft.aufirst%3DNina%26rft.auinit%3DNA%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fsu15010456%26rft.eissn%3D2071-1050%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BNA%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BSQ%26rft.au%3DYe%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
12,"Zhang, YJ",,Study on the coupling and coordination degree between urban tourism development and habitat environment in the Yangtze River Delta in China,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"By constructing the two evaluation systems of urban tourism development (TD) and habitat environment (HE), the dynamic response relationship between the two systems in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration from 2001 to 2020 is explored by using panel vector autoregression (PVAR) model and coupled coordination degree model. The study unearthed four intriguing findings: (1) the level of TD in the study area has been continuously rising from 2001 to 2020, with an initial slow growth rate and then fast. The level of HE is increasing steadily at an average annual rate of 7.05%. There exists a reciprocal response relationship between the two systems, with a strong shock effect in the short term and a synergistic evolution in the long term. (2) The coupling degree between the urban TD and HE has an increasing trend, and the coupling coordination degree of the two systems has an average annual rate of 4.165%, implying the interaction and promotion effect between the two systems is improving. (3) Most of the cities in the Yangtze River Delta gradually realize the evolution from dysfunctional type to coordinated type, but the overall coordination intensity is low. (4) The barrier degrees of TD system indicators show a small annual increasing trend, while the barrier degrees of HE system indicators show a substantial and continuous decreasing trend. In terms of the barrier degree factors, some important factors that restrict the coupled and coordinated development of the two systems are also reported. This research can provide a useful reference for the synergistic improvement of urban tourism economy and habitat environment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000859874100005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStudy%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bcoupling%2Band%2Bcoordination%2Bdegree%2Bbetween%2Burban%2Btourism%2Bdevelopment%2Band%2Bhabitat%2Benvironment%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BDelta%2Bin%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DYujia%26rft.auinit%3DYJ%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-022-23135-0%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BYJ%26rft.au%3DHaseeb%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BZJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"Moyo, S",Jul 2017 ,Decoupled reciprocal subsidies of biomass and fatty acids in fluxes of invertebrates between a temperate river and the adjacent land,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Streams and riparian areas are tightly coupled through reciprocal trophic subsidies, and there is evidence that these subsidies affect consumers in connected ecosystems. Most studies of subsidies consider only their quantity and not their quality. We determined the bidirectional exchange of organisms between the Kowie River and its riparian zone in South Africa using floating pyramidal traps (to measure insect emergence) and pan traps (to capture infalling invertebrates). The exchanges of biomass were variable spatially (three sites) and temporally (four seasons), with emergence declining about two orders of magnitude between summer (169-1402 mg m(-2) day(-1)) and winter (3-28 mg m(-2) day(-1)) across all sites, while invertebrate infall declined by a much smaller range from summer (413-679 mg m(-2) day(-1)) to winter (11-220 mg m(-2) day(-1)). Conversely, the absolute flux of physiologically important highly unsaturated fatty acids contained in the emergent and infalling arthropods peaked at comparable values in summer (emergence = 0.3-18 mg m(-2) day(-1) and infall = 0.3-3 mg m(-2) day(-1)) and declined less in winter (emergence = 0.01-0.51 mg m(-2) day(-1) and infall = 0.01-0.03 mg m(-2) day(-1)). During some seasons, there was no net flux of essential fatty acids, but there was generally a net flow of highly unsaturated fatty acids from river to land, even when land-to-river inputs dominated by biomass. Thus, quantitative net fluxes of biomass were decoupled from net fluxes of qualitatively key nutrients, establishing the importance of considering both the quality and the quantity of trophic subsidies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000405798900020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDecoupled%2Breciprocal%2Bsubsidies%2Bof%2Bbiomass%2Band%2Bfatty%2Bacids%2Bin%2Bfluxes%2Bof%2Binvertebrates%2Bbetween%2Ba%2Btemperate%2Briver%2Band%2Bthe%2Badjacent%2Bland%26rft.aufirst%3DSydney%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DMoyo%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-017-0529-0%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D703%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D689-703%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D689%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D79%26rft.au%3DMoyo%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DChari%252C%2BLD%26rft.au%3DRichoux%252C%2BNB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
14,"Shamieh, F",Feb 2020 ,Steganographic-Based Header Size Reduction Technique for Multimedia Streams,IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING,"High quality multimedia streaming over the Internet has proliferated in modern society due to the ever-increasing ties amongst people and businesses, thereby occupying the majority of all exchanged data traffic. The Internet is the primary multimedia exchange medium that is being used beyond its intended design. Using Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Transmission Control Protocol (HTTP/TCP), multimedia can be delivered to virtually all devices connected to the Internet. HTTP-based streaming suffers from the increasing overhead generated as the stream length, quality, and non-deterministic path conditions vary. In this paper, a novel cross-layer signalling reduction scheme is proposed to alleviate resource consumption in networks exchanging multimedia. The proposed scheme is a steganographic-based protocol translator that encodes information within multimedia payloads prior to packet flight to reduce the size of exchanged data. The encoded data is used by node pairs to replace bulky protocols, such as TCP, with lightweight protocols, such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP). In addition to the protocol translator, a routing scheme is given to be used in place of the inflated networking protocols to further reduce the header footprint. A utility function is developed to find the optimal overhead savings where simulations are conducted to verify the designs. Using virtual machines, the proposed translator is implemented where a multimedia file is exchanged and subject to encoding. The simulations and implementation show that the proposed methodologies will decrease the amount of signalling needed while increasing the overall network capacity. Furthermore, the proposed methods are capable of successfully extending existing signalling reduction methods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000519725800031,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSteganographic-Based%2BHeader%2BSize%2BReduction%2BTechnique%2Bfor%2BMultimedia%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DFuad%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DShamieh%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTNET.2019.2963792%26rft.eissn%3D1558-2566%26rft.epage%3D412%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1063-6692%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE-ACM%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BNETWORKING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D399-412%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D399%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BACM%2BT%2BNETWORK%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DShamieh%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BXB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=IEEE-ACM+TRANSACTIONS+ON+NETWORKING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

16,"Durighetto, N",Apr 2022 ,Probabilistic Description of Streamflow and Active Length Regimes in Rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In spite of the prevalence of temporary rivers over a wide range of climatic conditions, they represent a relatively understudied fraction of the global river network. Here, we exploit a well-established hydrological model and a derived distribution approach to develop a coupled probabilistic description for the dynamics of the catchment discharge and the corresponding active network length. Analytical expressions for the flow duration curve (FDC) and the stream length duration curve (SLDC) were derived and used to provide a consistent classification of streamflow and active length regimes in temporary rivers. Two distinct streamflow regimes (persistent and erratic) and three different types of active length regimes (ephemeral, perennial, and ephemeral de facto) were identified depending on the value of two dimensionless parameters. These key parameters, which are related to the underlying streamflow fluctuations and the sensitivity of active length to changes in the catchment discharge (here quantified by the scaling exponent b), originate seven different behavioral classes characterized by contrasting shapes of the underlying SLDCs and FDCs. The analytical model was tested using data gathered in three study catchments located in Italy and USA, with satisfactory model performances in most cases. Our analytical and empirical results show the existence of a structural relationship between streamflow and active length regimes, which is chiefly modulated by the scaling exponent b. The proposed framework represents a promising tool for the coupled analysis of discharge and river network length dynamics in temporary streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000780206800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR031344%26rft.atitle%3DProbabilistic%2BDescription%2Bof%2BStreamflow%2Band%2BActive%2BLength%2BRegimes%2Bin%2BRivers%26rft.aufirst%3DNicola%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DDurighetto%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR031344%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DDurighetto%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DMariotto%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DBotter%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"Maia, PD",Jun 2018 ,"Role of the floodplain lakes in the methylmercury distribution and exchanges with the Amazon River, Brazil",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,"Seasonal variability of dissolved and particulate methylmercury (F-MeHg, P-MeHg) concentrations was studied in the waters of the Amazon River and its associated Curuai floodplain during hydrological year 2005-2006, to understand the MeHg exchanges between these aquatic systems. In the oxic white water lakes, with neutral pH, high F-MeHg and P-MeHg concentrations were measured during the rising water stage (0.70 +/- 0.37 pmol/L, n = 26) and flood peak (14.19 +/- 9.32 pmol/g, n = 7) respectively, when the Amazon River water discharge into the lakes was at its maximum. The lowest mean values were reported during the dry season (0.18 +/- 0.07 pmol/L F-MeHg, n = 10 and 1.35 +/- 1.24 pmol/g P-MeHg, n = 8), when water and suspended sediments were outflowing from the lakes into the River. In these lakes, the MeHg concentrations were associated to the aluminium and organic carbon/nitrogen changes. In the black water lakes, with acidic pH and reducing conditions, elevated MeHg concentrations were recorded (0.58 +/- 0.32 pmol/L F-MeHg, n = 16 and 19.82 +/- 15.13 pmol/g P-MeHg, n = 6), and correlated with the organic carbon and manganese concentrations. Elevated values of MeHg partition coefficient (4.87 < K-d < 5.08 log (L/kg) indicate that MeHg is mainly transported associated with the particulate phase. The P-MeHg enrichment detected in all lakes suggests autochthonous MeHg inputs from the sediments into the water column. The MeHg mass balance showed that the Curuai floodplain is not the source of P-MeHg for the Amazon River. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

19,"Hofmann, H",Oct 15 2011 ,A Novel Method Using a Silicone Diffusion Membrane for Continuous Rn-222 Measurements for the Quantification of Groundwater Discharge to Streams and Rivers,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Rn-222 is a natural radionuclide that is commonly used as tracer to quantify groundwater discharge to streams, rivers lakes, and coastal environments. The use of sporadic point measurements provides little information about short- to medium-term processes (hours to weeks) at the groundwater-surface water interface. Here we present a novel method for high-resolution autonomous, and continuous, measurement of Rn-222 in rivers and streams using a silicone diffusion membrane system coupled to a solid-state radon-in-air detector (RAD7). In this system water is pumped through a silicone diffusion tube placed inside Sari outer air circuit tube that is connected to the detector. Rn-222 diffuses from the water into the air loop, and the Rn-222 activity in the air is measured. By optimizing the membrane tube length, wall thickness, and water flow rates through the membrane, it was possible to quantify radon variations over times scales of about 3 h. The detection limit for the entire system with 20 min counting was 18 Bq m(-3) at the 3 sigma level. Deployment of the system on a small urban stream showed that groundwater discharge is dynamic, with changes in Rn-222 activity doubling on the scale of hours in response to increased stream flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000295704500043,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BNovel%2BMethod%2BUsing%2Ba%2BSilicone%2BDiffusion%2BMembrane%2Bfor%2BContinuous%2BRn-222%2BMeasurements%2Bfor%2Bthe%2BQuantification%2Bof%2BGroundwater%2BDischarge%2Bto%2BStreams%2Band%2BRivers%26rft.aufirst%3DHarald%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DHofmann%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes202683z%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D8921%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D20%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D8915-8921%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D8915%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DHofmann%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DGilfedder%252C%2BBS%26rft.au%3DCartwright%252C%2BI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Gordey, AA",Apr 2022 ,Water Exchange between the Patos Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean Through a Narrow Strait,OCEANOLOGY,"The Patos Lagoon is located in southern Brazil and is the largest freshwater lagoon in the world; it is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a narrow strait. Through this strait, saline water flows from the sea into the lagoon and fresh water from the lagoon into the sea. Based on long-term in situ data from sea mooring and river gauge stations, as well as wind reanalysis data, the influence of local meteorological and hydrological conditions on water exchange through this strait has been studied. It was revealed that the distinct seasonal variability of water exchange is governed mostly by the variability of seasonal river discharge, but not at all by the variability of local atmospheric circulation. Similarly, the synoptic variability of water exchange between the Patos Lagoon and Atlantic Ocean on an annual scale depends mostly on the variability of river runoff and shows little relation to the variability of synoptic wind forcing. The water exchange responds to the variability of synoptic wind forcing in 24-48 h depending on the intensity of water exchange preceding the change in atmospheric circulation. Outflow of lagoon water to the sea is typical during the high river discharge period, while inflow of seawater to the lagoon is rare, occurring under specific wind conditions. Under strong wind, blowing along the Patos Lagoon from the strait to the continent, a negative surge of lagoon water near the strait and a positive surge on the opposite side of the lagoon are formed. As a result, seawater flows into the lagoon. During low river discharge periods, seawater inflow into the lagoon is typical, while short-term outflow is induced by the increase in river discharge.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000795146400004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWater%2BExchange%2Bbetween%2Bthe%2BPatos%2BLagoon%2Band%2Bthe%2BAtlantic%2BOcean%2BThrough%2Ba%2BNarrow%2BStrait%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DAA%26rft.aulast%3DGordey%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1134%252FS0001437022020072%26rft.eissn%3D1531-8508%26rft.epage%3D181%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0001-4370%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DOCEANOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D171-181%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D171%26rft.stitle%3DOCEANOLOGY%252B%26rft.volume%3D62%26rft.au%3DGordey%252C%2BAA%26rft.au%3DOsadchiev%252C%2BAS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=OCEANOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Navel, S",May 2011 ,Water-Sediment Exchanges Control Microbial Processes Associated with Leaf Litter Degradation in the Hyporheic Zone: a Microcosm Study,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,"The present study aimed to experimentally quantify the influence of a reduction of surface sediment permeability on microbial characteristics and ecological processes (respiration and leaf litter decomposition) occurring in the hyporheic zone (i.e. the sedimentary interface between surface water and groundwater). The physical structure of the water-sediment interface was manipulated by adding a 2-cm layer of coarse sand (unclogged systems) or fine sand (clogged systems) at the sediment surface of slow filtration columns filled with a heterogeneous gravel/sand sedimentary matrix. The influence of clogging was quantified through measurements of hydraulic conductivity, water chemistry, microbial abundances and activities and associated processes (decomposition of alder leaf litter inserted at a depth of 9 cm in sediments, oxygen and nitrate consumption by microorganisms). Fine sand deposits drastically reduced hydraulic conductivity (by around 8-fold in comparison with unclogged systems topped by coarse sand) and associated water flow, leading to a sharp decrease in oxygen (reaching less than 1 mg L-1 at 3 cm depth) and nitrate concentrations with depth in sediments. The shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions in clogged systems favoured the establishment of denitrifying bacteria living on sediments. Analyses performed on buried leaf litter showed a reduction by 30% of organic matter decomposition in clogged systems in comparison with unclogged systems. This reduction was linked to a negative influence of clogging on the activities and abundances of leaf-associated microorganisms. Finally, our study clearly demonstrated that microbial processes involved in organic matter decomposition were dependent on hydraulic conductivity and oxygen availability in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000290811600023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWater-Sediment%2BExchanges%2BControl%2BMicrobial%2BProcesses%2BAssociated%2Bwith%2BLeaf%2BLitter%2BDegradation%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%253A%2Ba%2BMicrocosm%2BStudy%26rft.aufirst%3DSimon%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DNavel%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00248-010-9774-7%26rft.eissn%3D1432-184X%26rft.epage%3D979%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0095-3628%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DMICROBIAL%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D968-979%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D968%26rft.stitle%3DMICROB%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D61%26rft.au%3DNavel%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DMermillod-Blondin%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=MICROBIAL+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"McClelland, JW",2015 ,Coordination and Sustainability of River Observing Activities in the Arctic,ARCTIC,"To understand and respond to changes in the world's northern regions, we need a coordinated system of long-term Arctic observations. River networks naturally integrate across landscapes and link the terrestrial and ocean domains. Changes in river discharge reflect changes in the terrestrial water balance, whereas changes in water chemistry are linked to changes in biogeochemical processes and water flow paths. Sustained measurements of river water discharge and water chemistry are therefore essential components of an Arctic observing network. As we strive to establish and sustain long-term observations in the Arctic, these two measurements must be coupled. Although river discharge and chemistry measurements are already coupled to some extent within national boundaries, this is not done in a consistent and coordinated fashion across the pan-Arctic domain. As a consequence, data quality and availability vary widely among regions. International coordination of river discharge and chemistry measurements in the Arctic would be greatly facilitated by formal commitments to maintain a set of core sites and associated measurements that are mutually agreed upon among pan-Arctic nations. Involvement of the agencies currently operating river discharge gauges around the Arctic and establishment of an overarching coordination entity to implement shared protocols, track data quality, and manage data streams would be essential in this endeavor. Focused studies addressing scale-dependent relationships between watershed characteristics and water chemistry, in-stream processes, and estuarine and coastal dynamics are also needed to support interpretation and application of Arctic river observing data as they relate to land and ocean change.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000365463500008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoordination%2Band%2BSustainability%2Bof%2BRiver%2BObserving%2BActivities%2Bin%2Bthe%2BArctic%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DJW%26rft.aulast%3DMcClelland%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.14430%252Farctic4448%26rft.eissn%3D1923-1245%26rft.epage%3D68%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0004-0843%26rft.jtitle%3DARCTIC%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D59-68%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D59%26rft.stitle%3DARCTIC%26rft.volume%3D68%26rft.au%3DMcClelland%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DTank%252C%2BSE%26rft.au%3DShiklomanov%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ARCTIC&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
23,"Teufl, B",Mar 2013 ,Effects of hydromorphology and riparian vegetation on the sediment quality of agricultural low-order streams: consequences for stream restoration,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Intensive agricultural land use imposes multiple pressures on streams. More specifically, the loading of streams with nutrient-enriched soil from surrounding crop fields may deteriorate the sediment quality. The current study aimed to find out whether stream restoration may be an effective tool to improve the sediment quality of agricultural headwater streams. We compared nine stream reaches representing different morphological types (forested meandering reaches vs. deforested channelized reaches) regarding sediment structure, sedimentary nutrient and organic matter concentrations, and benthic microbial respiration. Main differences among reach types were found in grain sizes. Meandering reaches featured larger mean grain sizes (50-70 mu m) and a thicker oxygenated surface layer (8 cm) than channelized reaches (40 mu m, 5 cm). Total phosphorous amounted for up to 1,500 mu g g(-1) DW at retentive channelized reaches and 850-1,050 mu g g(-1) DW at the others. While N-NH4 accumulated in the sediments (60-180 mu g g(-1) DW), N-NO3 concentrations were generally low (2-5 mu g g(-1) DW). Benthic respiration was high at all sites (10-20 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1)). Our study shows that both hydromorphology and bank vegetation may influence the sediment quality of agricultural streams, though effects are often small and spatially restricted. To increase the efficiency of stream restoration in agricultural landscapes, nutrient and sediment delivery to stream channels need to be minimized by mitigating soil erosion in the catchment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000315442500054,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bhydromorphology%2Band%2Briparian%2Bvegetation%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bsediment%2Bquality%2Bof%2Bagricultural%2Blow-order%2Bstreams%253A%2Bconsequences%2Bfor%2Bstream%2Brestoration%26rft.aufirst%3DBernadette%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DTeufl%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-012-1135-2%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D1793%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1781-1793%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1781%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DTeufl%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DWeigelhofer%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DHein%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
24,"Wang, H",Jan 2017 ,Fluctuations in Cd release from surface-deposited sediment in a river-connected lake following dredging,JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION,"Lakes connected to rivers have highly fluctuating hydrological conditions and therefore processes involving the retention and release of heavy metals are complex. Jinshan Lake is a typical river-connected lake in China, was selected to estimate Cd distribution in the surface-deposited sediment after dredging. Sediment samples with low, medium and high Cd contents were collected for annular flume experiments. The shear stress-induced Cd releases from these sediments were explored and incorporated into a numerical model using the finite volume method (FVM). The process of Cd release was studied for different temporal scales by numerical simulation. We observed that, because of the adequate water exchange between Jinshan Lake and the Yangtze River, the high-water year featured the largest annual release of Cd at 8777 kg, which was 2722 kg and 2033 kg higher than that of normal and low-water years, respectively. A balance between the upstreamrunoff and downstream tide resulted in the lowest Cd release in a normal-water year. The Cd release during a tidal cycle fell from 48 kg during the flood season to 11 kg during the dry period, whereas the variation coefficient increased from 0.59 to 0.67 during this period.

25,"Xiong, JL",Mar 2021 ,Water exchange and its relationships with external forcings and residence time in Chesapeake Bay,JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,"Water exchange, featured by bottom inflow and surface outflow in a typical estuary, determines the transport and redistribution of salt, nutrients, pollutants, and suspended sediments and organisms. Water exchange in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the US, has been extensively studied, yet its long-term interannual variability and its relationship with the external forcings are not fully understood. Based on a long-term (1980-2011) numerical model simulation, this study examines the water exchanges between Chesapeake Bay and the adjacent coastal shelf, between different regions within the bay, as well as their relationships with river discharge, wind, and residence time. Through an EOF analysis of the bottom inflow and surface outflow at seven selected cross-bay sections, we found that over 90% of the spatiotemporal variations of water exchange can be explained by the first two EOF modes, which are highly correlated with the freshwater discharge and northwesterly wind, respectively. Unlike the outflow that increases linearly with river discharge as commonly expected, the inflow responds non-monotonically to river discharge. The relationship between the river discharge and inflow can be described by a combination of the Michaelis-Menten/Monod equation and a linearly decreasing function, i.e., the inflow initially increases with river discharge due to enhanced gravitational circulation and then levels, and gradually declines due to overwhelming seaward barotropic current. We found a locally enhanced water exchange in the lower-middle bay, which can be attributed to the persistent reflux of surface outflow due to the irregular geometry and rapid shoaling in the channel bathymetry. The water exchange and the mean residence time can be connected reciprocally through the bay volume, yet the validation of this relationship depends on the timescale to be considered since the residence time at a given time is controlled by the future hydrodynamics. A delay effect should be considered when using the relationship to estimate outflow interchangeably with the direct computation of the outflow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000609114700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B103497%26rft.atitle%3DWater%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bits%2Brelationships%2Bwith%2Bexternal%2Bforcings%2Band%2Bresidence%2Btime%2Bin%2BChesapeake%2BBay%26rft.aufirst%3DJilian%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DXiong%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jmarsys.2020.103497%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1573%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0924-7963%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMARINE%2BSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BMARINE%2BSYST%26rft.volume%3D215%26rft.au%3DXiong%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DShen%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DDu%252C%2BJB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+MARINE+SYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
26,"GENEREUX, DP",Sep 1992 ,"DETERMINATION OF GAS-EXCHANGE RATE CONSTANTS FOR A SMALL STREAM ON WALKER BRANCH WATERSHED, TENNESSEE",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The steady state tracer gas method was used to determine gas exchange rate constants (k) for a small stream (annual average flow less-than-or-equal-to 1 m3/min) draining the West Fork of Walker Branch watershed in eastern Tennessee. Chloride was used as a conservative tracer to account for dilution by lateral inflow, and propane and ethane were used as volatile tracers. Gas exchange rate constants for propane (k(p)) were about 100 d-1 over a wide range of flow conditions, while those for ethane (k(e)) were about 117 d-1; an equivalent rate constant for O2 (k(O2)) would be about 118-139 d-1, depending on the method used for its calculation. These rate constants are much larger than those typically found in rivers and large streams. Much lower k(p) values (about 50 d-1) were found during one experiment conducted at low flow with much of the stream surface covered with floating leaves. Nineteen previously published empirical equations were used to predict k(O2) values for one 72-m stream reach; agreement between the predicted and measured values was generally very poor, underscoring the importance of field-measured gas exchange rates in studies of the transport and fate of volatile compounds. Because ethane and propane have similar gas exchange rates and similar aqueous diffusion coefficients (k(e)/k(p) and D(e)/D(p) are both close to 1, where D is the compound's diffusion coefficient), accurate determination of the exponent n in the relationship k(e)/k(p) = (D(e)/D(p))n was not possible. The ratio k(e)/k(p) (1.17) is much closer to D(e)/D(p) (1.24) than H(e)/H(p) (0.82, where H is the compound's Henry's law constant), suggesting that stripping of dissolved volatiles by air bubbles was not a dominant mode of gas exchange for the study stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1992JL48200016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDETERMINATION%2BOF%2BGAS-EXCHANGE%2BRATE%2BCONSTANTS%2BFOR%2BA%2BSMALL%2BSTREAM%2BON%2BWALKER%2BBRANCH%2BWATERSHED%252C%2BTENNESSEE%26rft.aufirst%3DDP%26rft.auinit%3DDP%26rft.aulast%3DGENEREUX%26rft.date%3D1992%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F92WR01083%26rft.epage%3D2374%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2365-2374%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2365%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DGENEREUX%252C%2BDP%26rft.au%3DHEMOND%252C%2BHF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"Tromboni, F",Sep 2017 ,"Heterogeneity and scaling of photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen uptake in three Atlantic Rainforest streams",ECOSPHERE,"Leaves, epilithon, macrophytes, and fine benthic organic material are central ecosystem compartments to food webs and mediate nutrient fluxes in streams. Most estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) are made at a reach scale, averaging across compartments. Thus, there is little information on how individual compartments contribute to and scale up to whole-stream estimates across watersheds. We compared estimates of GPP, ER, and nitrogen (N) uptake of individual ecosystem compartments (dm) and stream reaches (similar to 100 m) in three sizes of streams in a preserved Atlantic Rainforest watershed. The smallest stream had dense forest canopy cover, whereas the largest was more open. We measured substratum-specific rates of GPP and ER, as well as ammonium and nitrate N-15 uptake in recirculating chambers. We compared these decimeter-scale measurements to whole-stream estimates, using single-station dissolved oxygen (GPP and ER) and pulsed N uptake methods. Epilithon and macrophytes (when present) were the dominant GPP and N uptake compartments in open-canopy sites, and leaves contributed strongly to ER at all sites, even though they covered <3 percent of the stream bottom. Ammonium and nitrate uptake per unit N content varied significantly among substrata and streams. Upscaled inorganic N uptake per unit area was greater when macrophytes were present. Chamber measurements overestimated metabolic rates in the larger streams, but not in the smallest one. The smallest transient storage zone streams were more active than the biggest one, and this influenced the mismatch between whole-stream and chamber nutrient uptake estimates. We conclude that scaling to the whole watershed requires information on location in the watershed (e.g., where canopy cover is dense), rates of individual compartments, and reach-specific hydrodynamic information as influenced by large-scale geomorphic details (i.e., the size and activity of the transient storage zones).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000416627800010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be01959%26rft.atitle%3DHeterogeneity%2Band%2Bscaling%2Bof%2Bphotosynthesis%252C%2Brespiration%252C%2Band%2Bnitrogen%2Buptake%2Bin%2Bthree%2BAtlantic%2BRainforest%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DFlavia%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DTromboni%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fecs2.1959%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2150-8925%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSPHERE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOSPHERE%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DTromboni%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DDodds%252C%2BWK%26rft.au%3DMoulton%252C%2BTP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ECOSPHERE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
28,"Julian, JP",Dec 15 2015 ,Long-term impacts of land cover changes on stream channel loss,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Land cover change and stream channel loss are two related global environmental changes that are expanding and intensifying. Here, we examine how different types and transitions of land cover change impact stream channel loss across a large urbanizing watershed. We present historical land cover in the 666-km(2) Lake Thunderbird watershed in central Oklahoma (USA) over a 137 year period and coinciding stream channel length changes for the most recent 70 years of this period. Combining these two datasets allowed us to assess the interaction of land cover changes with stream channel loss. Over this period, the upper third of the watershed shifted from predominantly native grassland to an agricultural landscape, followed by widespread urbanization. The lower two-thirds of the watershed changed from a forested landscape to a mosaic of agriculture, urban, forest, and open water. Most channel length lost in the watershed over time was replaced by agriculture. Urban development gradually increased channel loss and disconnection from 1942 to 2011, particularly in the headwaters. Intensities of channel loss for both agriculture and urban increased over time. The two longest connected segments of channel loss came from the creation of two large impoundments, resulting in 46 km and 25 km of lost stream channel, respectively. Overall, the results from this study demonstrate that multiple and various land-use changes over long time periods can lead to rapid losses of large channel lengths as well as gradual (but increasing) losses of small channel lengths across all stream sizes. When these stream channel losses are taken into account, the environmental impacts of anthropogenic land-use change are compounded. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

29,"Han, H",Oct 2019 ,Spatial-Temporal Coupling Analysis of the Coordination between Urbanization and Water Ecosystem in the Yangtze River Economic Belt,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"As a primary pioneering region in China's ongoing urbanization process, the Yangtze River Economic Belt's (YREB's) urbanization process is itself continually accelerating, causing increasing pressure on the area's water ecosystem. It is necessary to examine the coordination relationship between the urbanization system and the water ecosystem in the YREB for realizing sustainable urban development. To this purpose, we use two comprehensive index systems, along with an improved coupling coordination degree (CCD) model. This method is used to analyze the coordination between urbanization and the water ecosystem across spatial gradients and temporal scales in the YREB, from 2008 to 2017. The factors acting as obstacles were diagnosed by utilizing the obstacle degree model. The results show that: (1) the coordination state of each region gradually improved during the 2008-2017 period. In terms of spatial distribution, the coordination state between two systems gradually increased from east to west. Moreover, the spatial differences across the 11 analyzed regions gradually narrowed with the passage of time. (2) The coordination between the two systems, from 2008 to 2017, evolved from a state of serious imbalance to a state of good coordination. The two systems passed from an initial period of imbalance or antagonism, coupled with rapid growth (2008-2011), through a period of basic coordination with steady growth (2011-2014), and finally toward a period of good coordination with slow growth (2014-2017). (3) Spatial urbanization and pressures on subsystems are the key factors acting as obstacles in the urbanization system and water ecosystem, respectively. Facing the process of rapid urbanization in China, the coupling analysis of the coordination between urbanization and the water ecosystem can help the government to formulate a reasonable new-type urban development strategy. This strategy will play an important role in China's sustainable urban development and water environmental protection. The findings of this study provide important support for urban planning in the future.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000494748600253,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B3757%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial-Temporal%2BCoupling%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2Bthe%2BCoordination%2Bbetween%2BUrbanization%2Band%2BWater%2BEcosystem%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%26rft.aufirst%3DHan%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DHan%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph16193757%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D16%26rft.au%3DHan%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BKZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
30,"Fraser, BG",Sep 1998 ,Seasonal boundary dynamics of a groundwater/surface-water ecotone,ECOLOGY,"Interstitial water, faunal samples, and hydrogeological data were collected beneath a riffle on the Speed River, southern Ontario, Canada. The purpose was to identify the location and seasonal fluctuation of the hyporheic/groundwater interface and to examine several aspects of water mass chemical signatures and the dynamics of the interstitial fauna. Concentration discontinuities in several water chemistry parameters delineated the chemical boundary between the true groundwater and hyporheic habitats. The groundwater mass was characterized as having higher levels of ammonium, alkalinity, and conductivity, and lower nitrate levels. Differences in water chemistry between the hyporheic and groundwater zones persisted throughout the year, though no single variable differed quantitatively between these two zones on all occasions. The location of the chemical discontinuity varied seasonally. Whereas hyporheic and groundwater faunal subunits of the interstitial community were identified and the location of the subunits coincided with the chemical breaklines, response to shifts in the position of the hyporheic/groundwater interface was taxon rather than subunit based. Fauna therefore provided poor spatial resolution in terms of pinpointing the location of the interface. Boundary fluctuation coincided with extremes in seasonal discharge patterns and was regulated by the relative strength of the upward force of baseflow and the downward force of advecting surface water. Identifying patterns of fluctuation of the hyporheic/groundwater interface, and consequently hyporheic habitat volume, may have important consequences for the storage, retention, and cycling of nutrients in lotic ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000075752700014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSeasonal%2Bboundary%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2Ba%2Bgroundwater%252Fsurface-water%2Becotone%26rft.aufirst%3DBG%26rft.auinit%3DBG%26rft.aulast%3DFraser%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1890%252F0012-9658%25281998%2529079%255B2019%253ASBDOAG%255D2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D2031%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-9658%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2019-2031%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2019%26rft.stitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D79%26rft.au%3DFraser%252C%2BBG%26rft.au%3DWilliams%252C%2BDD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
31,"Jarvie, HP",Apr 15 2018 ,Phosphorus and nitrogen limitation and impairment of headwater streams relative to rivers in Great Britain: A national perspective on eutrophication,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"This study provides a first national-scale assessment of the nutrient status of British headwater streams within the wider river network, by joint analysis of the national Countryside Survey Headwater Stream and Harmonised River Monitoring Scheme datasets. We apply a novel Nutrient Limitation Assessment methodology to explore the extent to which nutrients may potentially limit primary production in headwater streams and rivers, by coupling ternary assessment of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) depletion, with N: P stoichiometry, and threshold P and N concentrations. P limitation was more commonly seen in the rivers, with greater prevalence of N limitation in the headwater streams. High levels of potential P and N co-limitation were found in the headwater streams, especially the Upland-Low-Alkalinity streams. This suggests that managing both P and N inputs may be needed to minimise risks of degradation of these sensitive headwater stream environments. Although localised nutrient impairment of headwater streams can occur, there were markedly lower rates of P and N impairment of headwater streams relative to downstream rivers at the national scale. Nutrient source contributions, relative to hydrological dilution, increased with catchment scale, corresponding with increases in the extent of agricultural and urban land-use. The estimated nutrient reductions needed to achieve compliance with Water Framework Directive standards, and to reach limiting concentrations, were greatest for the Lowland-High-Alkalinity rivers and streams. Preliminary assessments suggest that reducing P concentrations in the Lowland-High-Alkalinity headwater streams, and N concentrations in the Upland-Low-Alkalinity rivers, might offer greater overall benefits for water-quality remediation at the national scale, relative to the magnitude of nutrient reductions required.

32,"Zhang, JL",Dec 2020 ,"Improved ecological development model for lower Yellow River floodplain, China",WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,"In this study, a model for the development of the wide floodplain in the lower Yellow River Basin, in China was developed. This model includes flood control schemes using grading criteria, enables sediment deposition in partitioned zones, and allows free exchange between channel runoff and sediment. The wide floodplain located between the main channel and levees is divided into three typical regions: the tender, low, and high floodplains. Different ecological models should be applied when these floodplains are constructed. This paper describes the associated research ideas and methodology, and clarifies several key issues, including sediment prediction and regulation, land planning, land use, and a multi-dimensional framework of safeguard measures for industries on the lower Yellow River floodplain. A refined ecological development model is proposed for the lower Yellow River floodplain, and future work on ecological and sustainable development of the lower floodplain is suggested. To establish a comprehensive system integrating runoff and sediment resource regulation in the Yellow River Basin, future work should focus on runoff and sediment exchange mechanisms in the wandering lower reaches. Furthermore, it is necessary to improve theories on floodplain planning and ecological construction, and these theories should be integrated with the research findings on land development across the lower Yellow River floodplain.

33,"Peng, TR",Jan 2018 ,Development of an isotopic stream index connecting physiographic characteristics of montane catchments,JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY,"This study is to develop an isotopic catchment-effect index (CEI) connecting the physiographic characteristics of stream catchments. A CEI, describing the extent of difference in stable water isotopic compositions (delta values) between stream water and local precipitation at any given sampling site, can help in judging whether water resource management should be focused on upstream regions of streams or local hydrology issues. To establish the isotopic CEI, this study measured delta values of stream water and derived delta O-18 of local precipitation based on regional isotopic altitude gradient at montane catchments of various sizes. Results indicate that the CEI is strongly related to catchment physiographic characteristics, such as length of main stream, mean area, mean elevation, perimeter, and slope. These characteristics are considered important indices of streamflow. Based on mathematical regression modeling describing the relationships between CEI and respective physiographic factors, CEI values can predict respective physiographic factors and vice versa. Moreover, according to the multiple equations derived in this study, catchments of larger size and steeper slope give elevated CEI values while greater stream length reduces the CEI's value. A greater CEI value indicates that local stream water is principally sourced from upstream reaches rather than contributions from local precipitation. In addition, CEI values are greater in winter than in summer resulting from monsoon effect. Consequently, this study establishes CEI as a useful descriptor of the physiographic characteristics of catchments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000425189100005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDevelopment%2Bof%2Ban%2Bisotopic%2Bstream%2Bindex%2Bconnecting%2Bphysiographic%2Bcharacteristics%2Bof%2Bmontane%2Bcatchments%26rft.aufirst%3DTsung-Ren%26rft.auinit%3DTR%26rft.aulast%3DPeng%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fjms.4038%26rft.eissn%3D1096-9888%26rft.epage%3D57%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1076-5174%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMASS%2BSPECTROMETRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D48-57%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D48%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BMASS%2BSPECTROM%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DPeng%252C%2BTR%26rft.au%3DTong%252C%2BLT%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BCT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+MASS+SPECTROMETRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

In this paper, we propose a universal map legend for the complex mapping of small stream channels in a detailed scale, which means including both the channel and adjacent floodplain segments. With the help of the symbology we are able to demonstrate both fluvial forms (i.e. individual features, grain size of bed sediments and fluvial deposits) and fluvial processes (i.e. contemporary trends in channels, character of lateral sediment inputs and flow characteristics) in a single map. In total, nearly 150 symbols were proposed and created as a combination of TrueType font and ArcGIS Style files. However, the principle can be used in various software.

35,"Dzwonkowski, B",Sep 2015 ,The coupled estuarine-shelf response of a river-dominated system during the transition from low to high discharge,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,"Opportunistic observations captured the coupled estuarine-shelf interactions as the Alabama coastal region transitioned from a period of low to flood river discharge conditions. The period of focus was 18 February to 10 April 2011 during which time a combination of in situ (water level, salinity and velocity) and remote sensing (ocean color) data provided information on the estuarine and shelf environment prior to, during, and post a major river discharge event that captured a relatively rare spatially synoptic view of the structural evolution of a discharge plume in response to changing forcing conditions. The discharge event generated major changes in the hydrographic conditions and forcing responses within the estuary and on the shelf. The resulting surface advected plume was observed for approximately two weeks, during which time the observed differences in shelf circulation were directly linked to the discharge plume and a plume bulge with anticyclonic circulation was identified at times throughout the event. The plume was exposed to a range of wind conditions which modulated the surface structure: downwelling winds elongated the plume structure and upwelling winds reversed and widened the plume. The influence of wind forcing, even during very low wind (<3.75 m s(-1)) and large outflow (approximate to 7000 m(3) s(-1)) conditions, was apparent, as a result of the shallow and wide characteristics of the plume. Anticyclonic bulge regions have only been identified in a few systems and the occurrence of this feature on the Alabama shelf has significant implications on transport and fate of river discharge in this region.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000363470300015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bcoupled%2Bestuarine-shelf%2Bresponse%2Bof%2Ba%2Briver-dominated%2Bsystem%2Bduring%2Bthe%2Btransition%2Bfrom%2Blow%2Bto%2Bhigh%2Bdischarge%26rft.aufirst%3DBrian%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DDzwonkowski%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015JC010714%26rft.eissn%3D2169-9291%26rft.epage%3D6163%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9275%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-OCEANS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6145-6163%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6145%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-OCEANS%26rft.volume%3D120%26rft.au%3DDzwonkowski%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DPark%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DCollini%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-OCEANS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
36,"Dare, GC",Aug 2020 ,Run-of-river dams as a barrier to the movement of a stream-dwelling amphibian,ECOSPHERE,"Human activities frequently create structures that alter the connectivity among habitats or act as barriers to the natural movement of animals. Movement allows individuals to access different habitats, connect life history stages, and maintain genetic diversity. Here, we evaluated whether run-of-river (RoR) hydropower projects, an emerging renewable energy source in British Columbia, interrupt the longitudinal connectivity among larval stream amphibians, by altering larval rearing densities, with possible repercussions on growth and survival. In three watersheds, we tested for differences in the average upstream and downstream density of larval coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), as well as changes to their longitudinal distribution upstream of the dams, as would be expected if RoR dams or their headponds act as barriers to the natural downstream drift of larvae. We found a 60% decrease in larval densities downstream compared to upstream of dams, consistent with RoR dams interrupting the natural pattern of downstreamA. trueidrift. Larval densities in the first 10 m above RoR headponds were 3 times higher compared to 100 m upstream, and when expressed in terms of relative abundance, we find a similar pattern, with between 2.5 and 3 times more larvae in the first 10 m above of the headpond than expected if larvae followed a uniform distribution. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that RoR dams alter the spatial connectivity ofA. trueilarvae, leading to an accumulation of larvae directly above the dam, with unknown consequences for larval growth and survival. Our findings suggest caution is warranted when interpreting before-after monitoring studies that are often used to evaluate the impact of dams, whereby we find that reductions in downstream densities could be due to interruptions of downstream movement as opposed to direct mortality.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000567504400006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be03207%26rft.atitle%3DRun-of-river%2Bdams%2Bas%2Ba%2Bbarrier%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bmovement%2Bof%2Ba%2Bstream-dwelling%2Bamphibian%26rft.aufirst%3DGriffin%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DGC%26rft.aulast%3DDare%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fecs2.3207%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2150-8925%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSPHERE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOSPHERE%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DDare%252C%2BGC%26rft.au%3DMurray%252C%2BRG%26rft.au%3DPalen%252C%2BWJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ECOSPHERE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
37,"Neupauer, RM",Sep-oct 2012 ,Adjoint Simulation of Stream Depletion Due to Aquifer Pumping,GROUND WATER,"If an aquifer is hydraulically connected to an adjacent stream, a pumping well operating in the aquifer will draw some water from aquifer storage and some water from the stream, causing stream depletion. Several analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical approaches have been developed to estimate stream depletion due to pumping. These approaches are effective if the well location is known. If a new well is to be installed, it may be desirable to install the well at a location where stream depletion is minimal. If several possible locations are considered for the location of a new well, stream depletion would have to be estimated for all possible well locations, which can be computationally inefficient. The adjoint approach for estimating stream depletion is a more efficient alternative because with one simulation of the adjoint model, stream depletion can be estimated for pumping at a well at any location. We derive the adjoint equations for a coupled system with a confined aquifer, an overlying unconfined aquifer, and a river that is hydraulically connected to the unconfined aquifer. We assume that the stage in the river is known, and is independent of the stream depletion, consistent with the assumptions of the MODFLOW river package. We describe how the adjoint equations can be solved using MODFLOW. In an illustrative example, we show that for this scenario, the adjoint approach is as accurate as standard forward numerical simulation methods, and requires substantially less computational effort.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000310728900013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAdjoint%2BSimulation%2Bof%2BStream%2BDepletion%2BDue%2Bto%2BAquifer%2BPumping%26rft.aufirst%3DRoseanna%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DRM%26rft.aulast%3DNeupauer%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1745-6584.2011.00901.x%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D753%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D746-753%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D746%26rft.stitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DNeupauer%252C%2BRM%26rft.au%3DGriebling%252C%2BSA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=GROUND+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
38,"Biancamaria, S",Dec 15 2009 ,Large-scale coupled hydrologic and hydraulic modelling of the Ob river in Siberia,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The Ob river in Western Siberia is one of the largest rivers in the Arctic and has a complex hydrological cycle mainly driven by snow melting in spring and rainfall and evapotranspiration in summer/autumn. The Ob is a source of fresh water for the Arctic Ocean and a change in its regime could affect the ocean thermohaline circulation. Due to the scarcity of in situ measurements in the Arctic and the size of the region, the hydrological modelling of large Arctic rivers is difficult to perform. To model the northern part of the Ob river basin, the land surface scheme ISBA (Interactions between Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere) has been coupled with the flood inundation model LISFLOOD-FP. Different sensitivity tests on input data and parameters have been performed and the results have been compared with in situ measurements and remotely sensed observations of water level. The best modelling is obtained with a river depth of 10 m and a Manning coefficient of 0.015: correlation and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients with in situ measurement are equal or even slightly above (depending on the precipitation dataset used) 0.99 and 0.95 respectively. The sensitivity tests show that modelling errors are mainly linked with atmospheric input (snow and rain precipitation), snow cover and drainage parameterization for ISBA and Manning coefficient, river depth and floodplain topography for LISFLOOD-FP.

39,"Nunes, ML",Oct 2003 ,Assessment of water quality in the Caima and Mau River basins (Portugal) using geochemical and biological indices,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"In order to study the anthropogenic impact of trace metals in the Caima and Mau River basins (north-central Portugal), 415 stream sediment samples were randomly collected in the main streams of these rivers and the minus 80-mesh fraction was analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). The presence of abandoned mines was identified as the main source of Cu, Pb, Cd and Ni in the area. A strong pair-wise correlation between Pb, Zn, Cd and Ni was found. In this study, the geochemical indices (Contamination Index (CI) and Multiple Pollution Index (MPI)), and the diatom indices (Specific Pollution Index (SPI) and Biological Diatom Index (BDI)) are used to define the Caima and Mau River basins environmental quality. The estimation of the CI and MPI indices shows that the sediments near Coval da Mo area are enriched with Pb, Cd, Zn Ni and Co suggesting an anthropogenic origin of metal contamination in this zone. In order to evaluate the biological effects caused by the trace metals, 17 sites were selected from the two River basins. Surface water and epilithic diatom communities were sampled during the summer of 2001. In general, the water and diatom data showed medium to good water quality. However, samples collected near the mining areas (Coval da Mo) revealed low abundance and diversity of diatom taxa indicating a stressed environment. Some diatoms showed morphologically abnormal valves that may be related to the high level of metal pollution in this area.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000185264800015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAssessment%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bquality%2Bin%2Bthe%2BCaima%2Band%2BMau%2BRiver%2Bbasins%2B%2528Portugal%2529%2Busing%2Bgeochemical%2Band%2Bbiological%2Bindices%26rft.aufirst%3DML%26rft.auinit%3DML%26rft.aulast%3DNunes%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1025636106890%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2932%26rft.epage%3D250%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0049-6979%26rft.issue%3D1-4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BAND%2BSOIL%2BPOLLUTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D227-250%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D227%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BSOIL%2BPOLL%26rft.volume%3D149%26rft.au%3DNunes%252C%2BML%26rft.au%3DDa%2BSilva%252C%2BEF%26rft.au%3DDe%2BAlmeida%252C%2BSFP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=WATER+AIR+AND+SOIL+POLLUTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
40,"Jiang, YA",Mar 2022 ,"Quantification of the coupling relationship between ecological compensation and ecosystem services in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China",LAND USE POLICY,"With the rapid development of human society, the self-regulation ability of ecosystem services has lagged far behind the degree of human destruction. As an effective environmental incentive policy, ecological compensation plays an important role in improving the ecology of all regions in the world. This study discussed the willingness of farmers to participate in ecological compensation in the Yangtze River Economic Belt based on the results of a questionnaire, analyzed the influencing factors, established differential ecological compensation standards, and explained the coupling relationship between ecological compensation and ecosystem services. First, the contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to analyze the ratio of farmers' willingness to accept and willingness to pay and to identify the factors affecting farmers' willingness to accept ecological compensation. The minimum-data approach was used to establish different types of ecological compensation standards in various administrative regions of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. Finally, the efficient guidelines for ecological compensation standards were analyzed. The results showed that the expected value ratio of farmers' willingness to accept and willingness to pay in the Yangtze River Economic Belt was 9.26 times, the actual compensation standard was generally lower than the theoretical compensation standard, and the degree of participation in seven administrative regions was less than 10%. When the compensation standard reached a certain threshold, the supply of ecosystem services would exceed the needs of regional development, leading to a ""marginal effect "", so compensation standard should be no longer increased. The results of this study provide scientific advice for formulating compensation standards, perfecting the ecological compensation mechanism, and improving the efficiency of ecological compensation in the rapidly developing regions represented by the Yangtze River Economic Belt.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000780375900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B105995%26rft.atitle%3DQuantification%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bcoupling%2Brelationship%2Bbetween%2Becological%2Bcompensation%2Band%2Becosystem%2Bservices%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DYanan%26rft.auinit%3DYA%26rft.aulast%3DJiang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.landusepol.2022.105995%26rft.eissn%3D1873-5754%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0264-8377%26rft.jtitle%3DLAND%2BUSE%2BPOLICY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DLAND%2BUSE%2BPOLICY%26rft.volume%3D114%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BYA%26rft.au%3DGuan%252C%2BDJ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BYJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=LAND+USE+POLICY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

42,"Tian, ZB",Sep 20 2021 ,Changes of phosphorus delivery from Yangtze River to Dongting Lake under new water and sediment conditions,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"Impounding the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has altered the water-sediment transportation regime in the Yangtze River (YR) downstream, with inevitable effects on phosphorus (P) transport behavior in river-connected lakes. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of water, suspended sediment (SS), and P transportation, adsorption, and bioavailability at the three inlets along YR diverted to Dongting Lake through field surveys, adsorption experiments, and historical data analysis. The results showed that P transportation was significantly correlated with sediment (p < 0.01) and fine sediment particles dominated the transportation of particulate phosphorus (PP) and bioavailable phosphorus (Bio-P). Before the TGR impoundment, the dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentration (0.03 mg/L) at the three inlets maintained a low level despite high P input, which was mainly due to the P adsorption and removal effect by sediment with high concentration and finegrained texture. In addition, we reveal two changes at the three inlets caused by the impoundment: (1) SS content and discharge were reduced by an order of magnitude and the particle size was coarsened by three times; (2) the PP flux and bioavailability significantly decreased, whereas the transportation proportion of DIP increased. Consequently, the P buffering and adjusting capacity by sediment in the pristine river ecosystem from dam upstream supplies and downstream resuspension were notably weakened. Currently, the SS content at the three inlets (0.07 g/L) is far below the lower critical threshold (0.20 g/L) obtained through experiments that can effectively remove phosphate. Additionally, the decline of water and sediment supply from YR to Dongting Lake increased water transparency and prolonged water retention time in lake. With continuous TGR regulation and construction of upstream cascade reservoirs, the risk of algal blooms in river-connected lakes is significantly exacerbated.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000728485000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B128248%26rft.atitle%3DChanges%2Bof%2Bphosphorus%2Bdelivery%2Bfrom%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2Bto%2BDongting%2BLake%2Bunder%2Bnew%2Bwater%2Band%2Bsediment%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DZebin%26rft.auinit%3DZB%26rft.aulast%3DTian%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jclepro.2021.128248%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1786%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0959-6526%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BCLEANER%2BPRODUCTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BCLEAN%2BPROD%26rft.volume%3D316%26rft.au%3DTian%252C%2BZB%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BLJ%26rft.au%3DChu%252C%2BZS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+CLEANER+PRODUCTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Hamann, EJ",Nov 2014 ,SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN SPAWNING HABITAT SELECTION BY CHINOOK SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS TSHAWYTSCHA) IN A WILDERNESS RIVER,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) survival during early life stages depends largely on spawning habitat selection by adults, which has been linked to biophysical stream variables (e.g. stream flow, velocity and substrate composition) as well as hyporheic exchange associated with riffle/pool and run/pool transitions. To examine how physical habitat variables influenced spawning habitat choice in one central Idaho (USA) wilderness stream, we used remote sensing techniques to classify and quantify the total amount of each aquatic habitat type present to assess how habitat quantity changed as stream order increased. Additionally, we measured physical habitat variables at each redd throughout the entire stream length for one spawning season to assess whether Chinook salmon selected for the same habitat parameters at varying spatial scales. Run, riffle and pool habitat types contributed similar proportions to the total area in both the upper and lower basins. However, transitional zones' (i.e. pool-riffle and pool-run transitions) accounted for 16% of the total area in the upper basin and only 4% in the lower. Redds were built in multiple habitat types in each of the three primary spawning locations, but transitional zones were chosen most frequently only in the upper basin. Significant differences in habitat variables were seen between spawning groups, with stream wetted width and velocity accounting for the majority of the variation. The techniques described here could be used to locate features that serve as indicators of potential spawning habitat, although caution should be exercised when extrapolating spawning habitat needs over large spatial extents.

44,"Hagedorn, B",Oct 2016 ,"Controls on the delta C-13(DIC) and alkalinity budget of a flashy subtropical stream (Manoa River, Hawaii)",APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"Hawaiian streams are flashy in nature because watersheds are small and steep and receive intense and unevenly distributed rainfall. As a result, stream chemistry is characterized by considerable spatiotem-poral variability. To examine how rainfall and streamflow affect the solute content of the Manoa River in Hawaii, time-series geochemical data collected during 17 sampling campaigns in spring-fall of 2010 were evaluated in a coupled delta C-13(DIC)/major ion inversion model. Spatially, the stream is characterized by a distinct shift from a low HCO3 (43 mg/L), low pCO(2) (3760 ppmv) and heavy delta C-13(DIC) (-6.5 parts per thousand) fingerprint in the upper reaches to a high HCO3 (91 mg/L), high pCO(2) (8961 ppmv) and light delta C-13(DIC) (-11.7 parts per thousand) signature in the lowlands. These trends are attributed to (1) progressive weathering of exposed aluminosilicates, and (2) downstream enrichment in CO2 from organic matter decay in the soil zone. Solute (i. e., nitrate) yields from nitric acid weathering are generally low (< 1% of TDS), even in the developed lowlands, where runoff of nitrate-enriched urban effluent has historically been documented. Data furthermore indicate a significant positive correlation between delta C-13(DIC) and rainfall rates in the mid-stream section of the river which is consistent with an atmospheric CO2 dilution effect during high rainfall events. This dilution effect needs to be accounted for to reliably describe the role of volcanic island river systems in global assessments of silicate weathering and CO2 degassing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

46,"Huybrechts, N",Mar 2011 ,A new closure methodology for 1D fully coupled models of mobile-bed alluvial hydraulics: application to silt transport in the Lower Yellow River,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,"A new closure approach involving a common parameter has been incorporated into a 1D fully coupled model of mobile-bed alluvial hydraulics. The objective is to simplify the methodology of 1D river routing models and to improve their accuracy. The common parameter, called control factor m, introduces the concept of Rossiter modes in alluvial hydraulics and represents the interactions between the flow, the sediment transport and the bed morphology. The feasibility of the new closure approach has been established by reproducing numerically the 2002 silt flushing experiment conducted on the Lower Yellow River (LYR) downstream the Xiaolangdi reservoir. From the comparison between the experimental data and the numerical results, a time evolution of the control factor m reproducing the characteristics of the flow has been extracted. This time evolution agrees with analysis conducted previously on other datasets and with data measured during the flush. The results obtained with this time evolution for the hydraulics, the sediment transport and bed adaptation are encouraging but still need improvements and further feeding from complementary experimental data.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000289007800004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bnew%2Bclosure%2Bmethodology%2Bfor%2B1D%2Bfully%2Bcoupled%2Bmodels%2Bof%2Bmobile-bed%2Balluvial%2Bhydraulics%253A%2Bapplication%2Bto%2Bsilt%2Btransport%2Bin%2Bthe%2BLower%2BYellow%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DN.%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DHuybrechts%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252FS1001-6279%252811%252960074-7%26rft.epage%3D49%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1001-6279%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BSEDIMENT%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D36-49%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D36%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BSEDIMENT%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D26%26rft.au%3DHuybrechts%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BYF%26rft.au%3DVerbanck%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+SEDIMENT+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
47,"Moore, RD",Aug 2005 ,Riparian microclimate and stream temperature response to forest harvesting: A review,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Forest harvesting can increase solar radiation in the riparian zone as well as wind speed and exposure to air advected from clearings, typically causing increases in summertime air, soil, and stream temperatures and decreases in relative humidity. Stream temperature increases following forest harvesting are primarily controlled by changes in insolation but also depend on stream hydrology and channel morphology Stream temperatures recovered to pre-harvest levels within 10 years in many studies but took longer in others. Leaving riparian buffers can decrease the magnitude of stream temperature increases and changes to riparian microclimate, but substantial warming has been observed for streams within both unthinned and partial retention buffers. A range of studies has demonstrated that streams may or may not cool after flowing from clearings into shaded environments, and further research is required in relation to the factors controlling downstream cooling. Further research is also required on riparian microclimate and its responses to harvesting, the influences of surface/subsurface water exchange on stream and bed temperature regimes, biological implications of temperature changes in headwater streams (both on site and downstream), and methods for quantifying shade and its influence on radiation inputs to streams and riparian zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000231549900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiparian%2Bmicroclimate%2Band%2Bstream%2Btemperature%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Bforest%2Bharvesting%253A%2BA%2Breview%26rft.aufirst%3DRD%26rft.auinit%3DRD%26rft.aulast%3DMoore%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D834%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D813-834%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D813%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DMoore%252C%2BRD%26rft.au%3DSpittlehouse%252C%2BDL%26rft.au%3DStory%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Bajwa, A",Jun 2016 ,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the Indus River catchment area, Pakistan: Status, soil-air exchange and black carbon mediated distribution",CHEMOSPHERE,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were investigated in passive air and soil samples from the catchment area of the Indus River, Pakistan. Sigma(15)OCPs ranged between 0.68 and 13.47 ng g(-1) in soil and 375.1 -1975 pg m(-3) in air. HCHs and DDTs were more prevalent in soil and air compartments. Composition profile indicated that beta-HCH and p,p'-DDE were the dominant of all metabolites among HCHs and DDTs respectively. Moreover, f(BC) and f(TOC) were assessed and evaluated their potential role in the distribution status of OCPs. The f(TOC) and f(BC) ranged between 0.77 and 2.43 and 0.04-0.30% respectively in soil. Regression analysis showed the strong influence of f(BC) than f(TOC) on the distribution of OCPs in the Indus River catchment area soil. Equilibrium status was observed for beta-HCH, delta-HCH, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, TC, HCB and Heptachlor with ff ranged between 0.3 and 0.59 while assessing the soil-air exchange of OCPs.

49,"Xiong, LX",Dec 2021 ,Coupling degree evaluation of heavy metal ecological capacity and enterprise digital transformation in river basins,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The digital transformation of heavy metal-related enterprises is the only way to improve the ecological capacity of river basins. This study explores the coupling relationship between heavy metal carrying capacity and enterprise digital transformation degree in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River urban agglomeration in 2019. Water quality simulation and data mining techniques were used to construct the material balance linear modelGIS ecological capacity evaluation framework based on ecological capacity theory. Fuzzy DEMATEL (Decisionmaking and Trial Evaluation Laboratory) and state space model methods were used to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of enterprises' digital transformation degree. The coupling characteristics of heavy metal ecological capacity and enterprise digital transformation degree in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were obtained by coupling the coordination degree and obstacle degree model. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) The overall environmental capacity of heavy metals shows a spatial pattern of decreasing from the center of the Wuhan urban agglomeration to the surrounding areas. (2) The areas with a high degree of enterprise digital transformation are mainly concentrated in southern Anhui Province, eastern Jiangxi Province and the Dongting Lake Economic circle; in contrast, the areas with a low degree are mainly distributed in northern Anhui Province, central and eastern Hubei Province and southern Hunan Province. (3) On the whole, the coupling degree of heavy metal ecological capacity and enterprise digital transformation has obvious spatial differentiation. High (the degree of ecological carrying capacity)-high (the degree of digital transformation of heavy metal enterprises), high-low, low-high and low-low accounted for 24.48%, 47.1%, 18.47% and 9.95% of the total study area, respectively. The ecological carrying capacity of the river basin was highly related to the development stage of the digital transformation of heavy metal enterprises, and the two have a significant degree of coupling.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000719661300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B108358%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bdegree%2Bevaluation%2Bof%2Bheavy%2Bmetal%2Becological%2Bcapacity%2Band%2Benterprise%2Bdigital%2Btransformation%2Bin%2Briver%2Bbasins%26rft.aufirst%3DLixin%26rft.auinit%3DLX%26rft.aulast%3DXiong%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecolind.2021.108358%26rft.eissn%3D1872-7034%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1470-160X%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BINDICATORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BINDIC%26rft.volume%3D133%26rft.au%3DXiong%252C%2BLX%26rft.au%3DNing%252C%2BJJ%26rft.au%3DDong%252C%2BYH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39CQkoq36ezeoq0VhJwFH&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+INDICATORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
