0,"Gulley, J",Nov 2013 ,"Dissolution in a variably confined carbonate platform: effects of allogenic runoff, hydraulic damming of groundwater inputs, and surface-groundwater exchange at the basin scale",EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"In variably confined carbonate platforms, impermeable confining units collect rainfall over large areas and deliver runoff to rivers or conduits in unconfined portions of platforms. Runoff can increase river stage or conduit heads in unconfined portions of platforms faster than local infiltration of rainfall can increase groundwater heads, causing hydraulic gradients between rivers, conduits and the aquifer to reverse. Gradient reversals cause flood waters to flow from rivers and conduits into the aquifer where they can dissolve limestone. Previous work on impacts of gradient reversals on dissolution has primarily emphasized individual caves and little research has been conducted at basin scales. To address this gap in knowledge, we used legacy data to assess how a gradient of aquifer confinement across the Suwannee River Basin, north-central Florida affected locations, magnitudes and processes of dissolution during 2005-2007, a period with extreme ranges of discharge. During intense rain events, runoff from the confining unit increased river stage above groundwater heads in unconfined portions of the platform, hydraulically damming inputs of groundwater along a 200 km reach of river. Hydraulic damming allowed allogenic runoff with SICAL<-4 to fill the entire river channel and flow into the aquifer via reversing springs. Storage of runoff in the aquifer decreased peak river discharges downstream and contributed to dissolution within the aquifer. Temporary storage of allogenic runoff in karst aquifers represents hyporheic exchange at a scale that is larger than found in streams flowing over non-karst aquifers because conduits in karst aquifers extend the area available for exchange beyond river beds deep into aquifers. Post-depositional porosity in variably confined carbonate platforms should thus be enhanced along rivers that originate on confining units. This distribution should be considered in models of porosity distribution used to manage water and hydrocarbon resources in carbonate rocks.

1,"Li, XJ",Nov 4 2019 ,Acoustofluidic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform enabled by coupled acoustic streaming,ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA,"Bead-based ELISA in microfluidics is a promising platform for reducing the reagent consumption and improving assay throughput due to its fast binding kinetics and low reagent consumption. Current microfluidic bead-based immunoassay mainly relies on magnetic and centrifugal forces to manipulate microparticles to complete an assay protocol. Here we report an acoustic streaming-based microfluidic method that can perform all the fluid and particle operations of bead-based ELISA. A series of sharp-edge structures are used to generate a long-range coupled acoustic streaming that enables simultaneous particle trapping and active molecular exchange in a dead-end microchannel. The device achieved > 99% of molecular exchange in 4 min, while maintaining a particle trapping efficiency of 85%. This acoustofluidic-based method demonstrates all three key operations in a bead-based immunoassay: (1) Beads ""immobilization""; (2) Active mixing of fluid for bead/target binding; (3) Active molecular exchange for reagent loading and washing. Finally, on-chip quantitative detection of biomarker IL-6 with a limit of detection similar to 50 pg/mL is achieved using this platform including an enzymatic signal amplification step. The small footprint, simple setup, and continuous flow operation of the acoustic streaming-based method makes it an attractive platform for continuous flow bead-based immunoassay.

2,"Pereda, O",2017 ,"Effects of aeration, sediment grain size and burial on stream litter breakdown and consumer performance: a microcosm study",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"Turbulence and aeration are reduced in many streams during low-flow periods as a consequence of drought or water abstraction, thus affecting invertebrate interactions and pivotal ecosystem processes such as the breakdown of organic matter (OM). These effects can be larger in the hyporheic zone (HZ), the ecotone connecting the surface stream and groundwater, especially when fine sediments reduce hydraulic conductivity. In addition, OM breakdown in the HZ could depend on the availability of OM in the benthic zone (BZ), because the latter would not only be a more accessible, and thus preferred, food resource, but also more easily scoured downstream. In a laboratory microcosm experiment of 28 days duration, we manipulated aeration, sediment size and location of OM (either all buried or half buried with half on the surface, simulating the HZ and BZ respectively). Six mayfly (Habroleptoides) individuals and four stonefly (Capnioneura) individuals were enclosed in each microcosm and the consumption of OM was measured. Lack of aeration reduced oxygen saturation from 94 to 66%, reducing OM consumption particularly on the surface, in contrast with our expectations. As hypothesised, the availability of surface OM significantly reduced invertebrate consumption of buried OM. Habroleptoides performed better than Capnioneura, especially in fine sediments. The results suggest that reduced turbulence can affect invertebrate trophic interactions as well as the decomposition of OM, depending on sediment grain size and the location of OM.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000416334800009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Baeration%252C%2Bsediment%2Bgrain%2Bsize%2Band%2Bburial%2Bon%2Bstream%2Blitter%2Bbreakdown%2Band%2Bconsumer%2Bperformance%253A%2Ba%2Bmicrocosm%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DOlatz%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DPereda%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FMF16346%26rft.eissn%3D1448-6059%26rft.epage%3D2274%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1323-1650%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2266-2274%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2266%26rft.stitle%3DMAR%2BFRESHWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D68%26rft.au%3DPereda%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DArroita%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DElosegi%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
3,"Zhao, YH",Oct 2021 ,Coordination Study on Ecological and Economic Coupling of the Yellow River Basin,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"The coupling and coordination relationship between ecology and the economy in the Yellow River Basin is a hot topic in sustainable development research. Said research has important guiding significance for the ecological security and comprehensive development of the Yellow River Basin. Taking the Yellow River Basin as the object of our study, based on the data of the economy, energy consumption data, ecology data and water resources data, we construct an indicator system of the economic development and ecological status of the Yellow River Basin and use the principal component analysis method to calculate the economic development and ecological status index. Then, we use the evaluation method, the coupling degree model and the coupling coordination degree model to analyze the time and space evolution trends of economic development and ecological state, coupling degree and coupling coordination degree. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2018, the economic development index of the Yellow River Basin rose steadily; the ecological status index showed a slow rise and then a downward trend. (2) The degree of coupling between economic development and ecological state has been considered as intensity coupling after 2005. The coupling trend slowly increased and then decreased, indicating that the interaction effect between the economy and ecology was first significantly enhanced and then slowly weakened. (3) The degree of coupling coordination increased from 0.2994 to 0.6266 and then decreased to 0.5917, reflecting the continuous improvement of the relationship between the regional economy and the ecological environment and the trend toward coordination. From 2015 to 2018, due to the gradual increase in the difference between economic development and ecological conditions, the coupling and coordination between the two decreased. Studies have shown that ecological construction and protection should be strengthened to ease the contradiction between the economy and ecology and achieve coordinated development.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000715339700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B10664%26rft.atitle%3DCoordination%2BStudy%2Bon%2BEcological%2Band%2BEconomic%2BCoupling%2Bof%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BBasin%26rft.aufirst%3DYanhong%26rft.auinit%3DYH%26rft.aulast%3DZhao%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph182010664%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D20%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BYH%26rft.au%3DHou%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BHT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

A fundamental question for P2P streaming systems is the maximum streaming rate that all users can sustain. Prior works have studied the optimal streaming rate for a complete network, where every peer is assumed to be able to communicate with all other peers. This is, however, an impractical assumption in real systems. In this paper, we are interested in the achievable streaming rate when each peer can only connect to a small number of neighbors. We show that even with a random peer-selection algorithm and uniform rate allocation, as long as each peer maintains downstream neighbors, where is the total number of peers in the system, the system can asymptotically achieve a streaming rate that is close to the optimal streaming rate of a complete network. These results reveal a number of important insights into the dynamics of the system, based on which we then design simple improved algorithms that can reduce the constant factor in front of the term, yet can achieve the same level of performance guarantee.

5,"Battin, TJ",Oct 1999 ,Hydrologic flow paths control dissolved organic carbon fluxes and metabolism in an alpine stream hyporheic zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The objective of the present paper was to link reach-scale streambed reactive uptake of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) to subsurface flow paths in an alpine stream (Oberer Seebach (OSB)). The topography adjacent to the stream channel largely determined flow paths, with shallow hillslope groundwater flowing beneath the stream and entering the alluvial groundwater at the opposite bank. As computed from hydrometric data, OSB consistently lost stream water to groundwater with fluxes out of the stream averaging 943 +/- 47 and 664 +/- 45 L m(-2) h(-1) at low (Q < 600 L s(-1)) and high (Q > 600 L s(-1)) flow, respectively. Hydrometric segregation of streambed fluxes and physicochemical mixing analysis indicated that stream water was the major input component to the streambed with average contributions of 70-80% to the hyporheic zone (i.e., the subsurface zone where shallow groundwater and stream water mix). Surface water was also the major source of DOC with 0.512 +/- 0.043 mg C m(-2) h(-1) to the streambed. The DOC flux from shallow riparian groundwater was lower (0.309 +/- 0.071 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and peaked in autumn with 1.011 mg C m(-2) h(-1). I computed the relative proportion of downstream discharge through the streambed as the ratio of the downstream length (S-sw) a stream water parcel travels before entering the streambed to the downstream length (S-hyp) a streambed water parcel travels before returning to the stream water. The relative streambed DOC retention efficiency, calculated as (input-output)/input of interstitial DOG, correlated with the proportion (S-sw/S-hyp) of downstream discharge (r(2) = 0.76, p = 0.006), Also, did the streambed metabolism (calculated as DO uptake from mass balance) decrease with low subsurface downstream routing, whereas elevated downstream discharge through the streambed stimulated DO uptake (r(2) = 0.69, p = 0.019)? Despite the very short DOC turnover times (similar to 0.05 days, calculated as mean standing stock/annual input) within the streambed, the latter constitutes a net sink of DOC (similar to 14 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). Along with high standing stocks of sediment associated particulate organic carbon, these results suggest microbial biofilms as the major retention and storage site of DOC in an alpine stream where large hydrologic exchange controls DOC fluxes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000082832400020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bflow%2Bpaths%2Bcontrol%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bfluxes%2Band%2Bmetabolism%2Bin%2Ban%2Balpine%2Bstream%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DTJ%26rft.auinit%3DTJ%26rft.aulast%3DBattin%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F1999WR900144%26rft.epage%3D3169%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3159-3169%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3159%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D35&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
6,"Butturini, A",Jun 2002 ,The influence of riparian-hyporheic zone on the hydrological responses in an intermittent stream,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Stream and riparian groundwater hydrology has been studied in a small intermittent stream draining a forested catchment for a system representative of a Mediterranean climate, The relationship between precipitation and stream runoff and the interactions between stream water and the surrounding riparian groundwater have been analysed under a wide spectrum of meteorological conditions. The hypothesis that the hydrological condition of the near-stream groundwater compartment can regulate the runoff generation during precipitation events was tested, Stream runoff is characterised by a summer dry period, and precipitation input explained only 250,6 of runoff variability over the study period (r(2)=0.25, d.f,=5 1, p<0,001). The variability of precipitation v. stream runoff is explained partly by the hydrogeological properties of the riparian near-stream zone. This zone is characterised by high hydrological conductivity values and abrupt changes in groundwater level in summer. The summer dry period begins with a rapid decrease in near-stream groundwater level, and ends just after the first autumnal rain when the original groundwater level recovers suddenly. Within this period, storms do not cause major stream runoff since water infiltrates rapidly into the riparian compartment until it is refilled during the subsequent winter and spring; then the precipitation explains the 80% of the stream runoff variability (r(2)=0. 80, d.f.=34, p<0.001), These results suggest that the hydrological interaction between the riparian groundwater compartment and the stream channel is important in elucidating the hydrological responses during drought periods in small Mediterranean streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000177534200019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Briparian-hyporheic%2Bzone%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bhydrological%2Bresponses%2Bin%2Ban%2Bintermittent%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DButturini%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-6-515-2002%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D525%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D515-525%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D515%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D6%26rft.au%3DButturini%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBernal%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DSabater%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
7,"Gomez-Gener, L",Sep 2021 ,Towards an improved understanding of biogeochemical processes across surface-groundwater interactions in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,"Surface-groundwater interactions in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES), waterways which do not flow year-round, are spatially and temporally dynamic because of alternations between flowing, non-flowing and dry hydrological states. Interactions between surface and groundwater often create mixing zones with distinct redox gradients, potentially driving high rates of carbon and nutrient cycling. Yet a complete understanding of how underlying biogeochemical processes across surface-groundwater flowpaths in IRES differ among various hydrological states remains elusive. Here, we present a conceptual framework relating spatial and temporal hydrological variability in surface water-groundwater interactions to biogeochemical processing hotspots in IRES. We combine a review of theIRES biogeochemistry literature with concepts of IRES hydrogeomorphology to: (i) outline common distinctions among hydrological states in IRES; (ii) use these distinctions, together with considerations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles within IRES, to predict the relative potential for biogeochemical processing across different reach-scale processing zones (flowing water, fragmented pools, hyporheic zones, groundwater, and emerged sediments); and (iii) explore the potential spatial and temporal variability of carbon and nutrient biogeochemical processing across entire IRES networks. Our approach esti- mates the greatest reach-scale potential for biogeochemical processing when IRES reaches are fragmented into isolated surface water pools, and highlights the potential of relatively understudied processing zones, such as emerged sediments. Furthermore, biogeochemical processing in fluvial networks dominated by IRES is likely more temporally than spatially variable. We conclude that biogeochemical research in IRES would benefit from focusing on interactions between different nutrient cycles, surface-groundwater interactions in non-flowing states, and consideration of fluvial network architecture. Our conceptual framework outlines opportunities to advance studies and expand understanding of biogeochemistry in IRES.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000703334000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B103724%26rft.atitle%3DTowards%2Ban%2Bimproved%2Bunderstanding%2Bof%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bprocesses%2Bacross%2Bsurface-groundwater%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Bintermittent%2Brivers%2Band%2Bephemeral%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DLluis%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DGomez-Gener%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.earscirev.2021.103724%26rft.eissn%3D1872-6828%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-8252%26rft.jtitle%3DEARTH-SCIENCE%2BREVIEWS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DEARTH-SCI%2BREV%26rft.volume%3D220%26rft.au%3DGomez-Gener%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DSiebers%252C%2BAR%26rft.au%3DZoppini%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=EARTH-SCIENCE+REVIEWS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
8,"Liu, SD",Mar 15 2021 ,Groundwater as a limited carbon dioxide source in a large river (the Yangtze River),SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Groundwater discharge to river networks makes up a major source of riverine CO2 emission, available evidence however comes mainly from headwater streams which are directly connected to terrestrial ecosystems and spatially limited in terms of system size. Here relying on coupled water and CO2 mass balances, we quantified the groundwater-mediated CO2 input to the Yangtze River mainstem on an annual basis, where the mass balance of water provided physical constraints on CO2 exchange between the river and groundwater. A landscape topographic control of the groundwater-river interaction was proposed where mountain reaches preferentially receive water and CO2 discharge from the groundwater while plain alluvial reaches predominantly lose water to the aquifers. Groundwater CO2 inputs were however small in magnitude on all reaches (0.3-14% of the total CO2 emission and transport by the river) and unable to account for the discrepancy between surface evasion and internalmetabolismin the river. Minor direct groundwater discharge to the reaches in comparison to smaller streams (negative to < 3.5% of the surface water flows) was concluded to be the main reason for low groundwater-sourced CO2 in the large river reaches.

9,"Shi, XL",Jan 2019 ,"Mychonastes dominates the photosynthetic picoeukaryotes in Lake Poyang, a river-connected lake",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,"Lake Poyang, which is connected to the Yangtze River, is the largest freshwater lake in China and experiences large and frequent changes in water levels. The seasonal diversity and composition of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) in Lake Poyang were investigated from flow-cytometry-sorted samples using MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. Flow cytometric counting indicated that PPEs accounted for 97% of the total picophytoplankton abundance in spring, reaching a maximum value of 6.30 x 10(4) cells mL(-1). PPEs in Lake Poyang showed lower diversity than those in other investigated lakes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and were dominated by one OTU (66.29%) affiliated with Mychonastes (Chlorophyceae). Other minor classes of PPEs were found to be sporadically abundant in specific seasons, i.e. Chrysophyceae prevailed in spring and summer, while Eustigmatophyceae was mainly present in winter. This study reports coccal green algae of Mychonastes in Lake Poyang; additionally, these algae are reportedly representative of the prominent plankton in this river-connected lake ecosystem but are often overlooked due to their lack of morphological features. Finally, the sequencing results from the sorted samples of Lake Poyang revealed that the proportion of PPEs was quite low, with an average of 36% of total reads. Many OTUs belonging to heterotrophic picoeukaryotes were also identified in the sorted samples, most of which were affiliated with terrestrial fungi, including Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. The spores of these fungi can disperse in the aquatic environment during the flood seasons, yet their effect on PPEs is still unclear.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000453664200010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Bfiy211%26rft.atitle%3DMychonastes%2Bdominates%2Bthe%2Bphotosynthetic%2Bpicoeukaryotes%2Bin%2BLake%2BPoyang%252C%2Ba%2Briver-connected%2Blake%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaoli%26rft.auinit%3DXL%26rft.aulast%3DShi%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1093%252Ffemsec%252Ffiy211%26rft.eissn%3D1574-6941%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-6496%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFEMS%2BMICROBIOLOGY%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFEMS%2BMICROBIOL%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D95%26rft.au%3DShi%252C%2BXL%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BSN%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BYF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=FEMS+MICROBIOLOGY+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

12,"Torrens, CL",Jul 2022 ,Dissolved Organic Carbon Chemostasis in Antarctic Polar Desert Streams,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key variable impacting stream biogeochemical processes. The relationship between DOC concentration (C) and stream discharge (q) can elucidate spatial and temporal DOC source dynamics in watersheds. In the ephemeral glacial meltwater streams of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica, the C-q relationship has been applied to dissolved inorganic nitrogen and weathering solutes including silica, which all exhibit chemostatic C-q behavior; but DOC-q dynamics have not been studied. DOC concentrations here are low compared to temperate streams, in the range of 0.1-2 mg C l(-1), and their chemical signal clearly indicates derivation from microbial biomass (benthic mats and hyporheic biofilm). To investigate whether the DOC generation rate from these autochthonous organic matter pools was sufficient to maintain chemostasis for DOC, despite these streams' large diel and interannual fluctuations in discharge, we fit the long-term DOC-q data to a power law and an advection-reaction model. Model outputs and coefficients of variation characterize the DOC-q relationship as chemostatic for several MDV streams. We propose a conceptual model in which hyporheic carbon storage, hyporheic exchange rates, and net DOC generation rates are key interacting components that enable chemostatic DOC-q behavior in MDV streams. This model clarifies the role of autochthonous carbon stores in maintaining DOC chemostasis and may be useful for examining these relationships in temperate systems, which typically have larger sources of bioavailable autochthonous organic carbon than MDV streams but where this autochthonous signal could be masked by a stronger allochthonous contribution.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000825349500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021JG006649%26rft.atitle%3DDissolved%2BOrganic%2BCarbon%2BChemostasis%2Bin%2BAntarctic%2BPolar%2BDesert%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DChrista%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DCL%26rft.aulast%3DTorrens%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021JG006649%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D127%26rft.au%3DTorrens%252C%2BCL%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"Liao, F",May 2021 ,Tracing Bank Storage and Hyporheic Exchange Dynamics Using Rn-222: Virtual and Field Tests and Comparison With Other Tracers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Dynamic hydrologic exchange flows in river beds and banks are important for many ecosystem functions throughout river corridors. Here we test whether the exchanges and the associated mixing between a flooding river and groundwater within the river's bank can be effectively traced by Radon-222 (Rn-222), a naturally occurring, inert, radiogenic, and radioactive gas that can be analyzed and monitored in situ. The assessment was done by simulation of groundwater flow and reactive transport of Rn-222 in the bank following a single, relatively rapid (hours long) flood wave and auxiliary field observations of Rn-222, temperature and total dissolved solids (a surrogate for any ionic conservative tracer). Results illustrate that Rn-222 is more effective than temperature and total dissolved solids in tracing dynamic hyporheic exchange. Rn-222 variations in space and time are larger than the analytical uncertainty of common measurement methods. The individual effects of aquifer hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity, river water Rn-222 concentration, and bank topography were analyzed through sensitivity analysis. Larger hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity, lower Rn-222 concentration in river water relative to groundwater, and gentler bank slopes resulted in a more prominent and traceable Rn-222 signal. The transport and residence time of exchanged water may be estimated and interpreted using reactive transport models such as those implemented here. However, such application is sensitive to fluctuations in river water Rn-222, requiring it to be well characterized. The assessment provides guidance for using Rn-222 as a tracer for groundwater and surface water interactions in dynamic settings.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000654464300054,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028960%26rft.atitle%3DTracing%2BBank%2BStorage%2Band%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BDynamics%2BUsing%2BRn-222%253A%2BVirtual%2Band%2BField%2BTests%2Band%2BComparison%2BWith%2BOther%2BTracers%26rft.aufirst%3DFu%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DLiao%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028960%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DLiao%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BGC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

15,"Dutra-Maia, P",Nov 15 2009 ,Mercury distribution and exchanges between the Amazon River and connected floodplain lakes,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"This work presents the distribution and the partition of mercury (Hg) in the Curuai floodplain lakes along the Amazon River. The maximum Total Filtered Hg (T-FHg) concentrations in the floodplain lakes (28 to 52 pmol L-1) coincide with the maximum T-FHg concentrations of the Amazon River and are measured during the flooding period. The lowest T-FHg values (3 to 5 pmol L-1) are observed during the flood peak of the mainstream, during the rainy season, when waters are diluted by the local rainfall. In this system, Hg is mainly transported in the particulate phase, confirmed by elevated values of the Hg partition coefficient (4.77 < K-d (Hg) < 5.83 Lkg(-1)). The highest Total Particulate Hg (T-PHg) concentrations (47-478 pmol L-1) in the lakes are measured during the dry season when they are isolated from the mainstream. This enrichment is due to the elevated TSS content associated to the re-suspension of the bottom sediments by the wind action and the bioturbation in shallow water lakes.In the flooded system, the lakes show different geochemical characteristics that control the Hg distribution and partition. In the white water (WW) lakes, characterized by oxidative neutral waters and highest TSS contents (till 2041 mg L-1), the T-PHg is associated to the particulate organic matter mainly during the dry season, while the T-FHg and T-FMn concentrations are correlated. In the black water (BW) lakes that show reductive pH conditions and lowest TSS load (2 to 52 mg L-1), P-iron and T-PHg display a positive relationship whereas the redox conditions favor the desorption of Hg from the particulate to the filtered phase.The mercury mass budget estimated in this study confirms that the Curuai floodplain system acts as a particulate mercury trap, with a net storage of particulate Hg of 150 kg PHg year(-1).

17,"Kazezyilmaz-Alhan, CM",Jan 15 2008 ,Analytical solutions for contaminant transport in streams,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The importance of the effect of surface/ground water interactions on contaminant transport in streams and rivers has been greatly recognized in the last two decades. Bencala and Walters (1983) [Bencala, K.E., Walters, R.A., 1983. Simulation of solute transport in a mountain pool-and-riffle stream - a transient storage model. Water Resources Research 19 (3), 718-724.] developed a mathematical model for the transient storage zone to represent the movement of solute from main streams into stagnant zones and back to the main stream. This model calculates the concentrations of a main channel and a storage zone and the transient storage is represented by the mass exchange due to the concentration difference between the stream and the storage zone. Later, Kazezyllmaz-Alhan and Medina (2006) [Kazezyitmaz-Alhan, C.M., Medina Jr., M.A., 2006. Stream solute transport incorporating hyporheic zone processes. Journal of Hydrology 329 (1-2), 26-38.] made several improvements to this transient storage model by incorporating advection and dispersion into the hyporheic zone and representing the mass transport between the channel and hyporheic zone by mass flux terms. In this study, analytical solutions are derived for both transient storage models for the cases of continuous and finite injections of a tracer. The analytical. solutions provide the researchers with computational speed in obtaining results for contaminant transport problems, and a means to check the validity of the numerical models. The analytical solutions are compared to the numerical solutions for hypothetical problems. Comparison of results shows that the numerical and analytical solutions are in very good agreement.

18,"Esmaeili, S",Sep 2016 ,Investigation of streaming potential coupling coefficients and zeta potential at low and high salinity conditions: Experimental and modeling approaches,JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,"Streaming potential measurement is one of the electrokinetic techniques used to determine the average zeta potential of porous rock which can provide reliable information on reservoir flow behavior and wettability state of the rock surface. Streaming potential measurement using electrodes has recently been introduced in the oil reservoirs applications and there are still significant uncertainties during the measurements and interpretation of streaming potential results. The primary purpose of this work is to establish a setup to measure the streaming potential of porous media with low scattering and evaluate voltage measurements based on the paired stabilization and pressure ramping methods. Streaming potential coupling coefficients of 36 samples of sand particle are measured in salinity from 0.0005 M to 0.025 M NaCl solutions. Then, the measured streaming potential coupling coefficients and zeta potential are compared with the published experimental results. Besides the good agreement that was achieved with the published experimental results, much lower scattering in the data points was accomplished for different saline injecting water. An accurate empirical expression is proposed for the measured coupling coefficients which predicts streaming potential coupling coefficients and zeta potential in the salinity range from 0.0001 M to 5.5 M.

Therefore, the scope of the research is to show the viability of the methodology suggested in a real case (Biebrza river, Poland, Europe). Considering that the model requires extensive manipulation in the creation of the packages, a test phase through the seepage package of MODFLOW is carried out with the aim of representing the river package of MODFLOW. FloPy is the tool chosen to develop this implementation due to the versatility of manipulating the packages available in MODFLOW through coding. The obtained results showed a correct implementation of the AHF model using the example of the Biebrza River.

20,"Yahorava, V",Feb 2014 ,Ion exchange technology for the efficient recovery of precious metals from waste and low-grade streams,JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY,"Efficient recovery of precious metals from process solutions is essential for improving process economics. Traditionally, precious metals are relatively effectively recovered from waste streams via precipitation or cementation. However, these approaches have a number of drawbacks, including poor water balance, creation of environmentally unfriendly waste streams, and losses of precious metals. Ion exchange technology is an alternative for the recovery of precious metals from waste or low-grade streams. This technology allows the recovery of the precious metals to extremely low levels (micrograms per litre) with relatively high upgrade ratios from the solution onto the resin without major water balance concerns, while the impact on the environment could be minimized or avoided.Research was conducted on the recovery of platinum group metals and gold from different low-grade and waste streams from one of the precious metals refineries in South Africa by means of ion exchange. Various functionallties and matrices (granular and fibrous) of ion exchange materials were evaluated. The results from these studies indicated that in some cases ion exchange could be very effective for the recovery of precious metals, and that the PGM concentration could be reduced to < 1 mg/L. The upgrading ratios of the various PGMs onto the specific fibres were relatively high for the specific streams evaluated, which might in some cases justify incineration of the loaded material instead of stripping and recycling the adsorbent. The cost of direct incineration for one of the waste streams tested would be less than 1% of the value of the PGMs recovered. However, the adsorbent has to be carefully selected and the process design optimized for each specific stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000356757100008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIon%2Bexchange%2Btechnology%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Befficient%2Brecovery%2Bof%2Bprecious%2Bmetals%2Bfrom%2Bwaste%2Band%2Blow-grade%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DV.%26rft.auinit%3DV%26rft.aulast%3DYahorava%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft.epage%3D181%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2225-6253%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BSOUTHERN%2BAFRICAN%2BINSTITUTE%2BOF%2BMINING%2BAND%2BMETALLURGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D173-181%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D173%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BS%2BAFR%2BI%2BMIN%2BMETALL%26rft.volume%3D114%26rft.au%3DYahorava%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DKotze%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+SOUTHERN+AFRICAN+INSTITUTE+OF+MINING+AND+METALLURGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Harvey, JW",Apr 1998 ,Effect of enhanced manganese oxidation in the hyporheic zone on basin-scale geochemical mass balance,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We determined the role of the hyporheic zone (the subsurface zone where stream water and shallow groundwater mix) in enhancing microbially mediated oxidation of dissolved manganese (to form manganese precipitates) in a drainage basin contaminated by copper mining. The fate of manganese is of overall importance to water quality in Final Creek Basin, Arizona, because manganese reactions affect the transport of trace metals. The basiri-scale role of the hyporheic zone is difficult to quantify because stream-tracer; studies do not always reliably characterize the cumulative effects of the hyporheic zone. This study determined cumulative effects of hyporheic reactions in Final Creek basin by characterizing manganese uptake at several spatial scales (stream-reach scale, hyporheic-flow-path scale, and sediment-grain scale). At the stream-reach scale a one-dimensional stream-transport model (including storage zones to represent hyporheic flow paths) was used to determine a reach-averaged time constant for manganese uptake in hyporheic zones, 1/lambda(s), 1.3 hours, which was somewhat faster but still similar to manganese uptake time constants that were measured directly in centimeter-scale hyporheic flow paths (1/lambda(h) = 2.6 hours), and in laboratory batch experiments using streambed sediment (1/lambda = 2.7 hours). The modeled depths of subsurface storage zones (d(s) = 4-17 cm) and modeled residence times of water in storage zones (t(s) = 3-12 min) were both consistent with direct measurements in hyporheic flow paths (d(h) = 0-15 cm, and t(h) = 1-25 min). There was also good agreement between reach-scale modeling and direct measurements of the percentage removal of dissolved manganese in hyporheic flow paths (f(s) = 8.9%, and f(h) = 9.3%). Manganese uptake experiments in the laboratory using sediment from Final Creek demonstrated (through comparison of poisoned and unpoisoned treatments) that the manganese removal process was enhanced by microbially mediated oxidation. The cumulative effect of hyporheic exchange in Final Creek basin was to remove approximately 20% of the dissolved manganese flowing out of the drainage basin. Our results illustrate that the cumulative significance of reactive uptake in the hyporheic zone depends on the balance between chemical reaction rates, hyporheic porewater residence time, and turnover of streamflow through hyporheic flow paths. The similarity between the hyporheic reaction timescale (1/lambda(s) approximate to 1.3 hours), and the hyporheic porewater residence timescale (t(s) approximate to 8 min) ensured that there was adequate time for the reaction to progress. Furthermore, it was the similarity between the turnover length for stream water flow through hyporheic how paths (L-s = stream velocity/storage-zone exchange coefficient approximate to 1.3 km) and the length of Final Creek (L approximate to 7 km), which ensured that all stream water passed through hyporheic flow paths several times.As a means to generalize our findings to other sites where similar types of hydrologic and chemical information are available, we suggest a cumulative significance index for hyporheic reactions, R-s = lambda(s)t(s)L/L-s (dimensionless); higher values indicate a greater potential for hyporheic reactions to influence geochemical mass balance. Our experience in Final Creek basin suggests that values of R-s > 0.2 characterize systems where hyporheic reactions are likely to influence geochemical mass balance at the drainage-basin scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000072816600008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Benhanced%2Bmanganese%2Boxidation%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bon%2Bbasin-scale%2Bgeochemical%2Bmass%2Bbalance%26rft.aufirst%3DJW%26rft.auinit%3DJW%26rft.aulast%3DHarvey%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F97WR03606%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D636%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D623-636%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D623%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DFuller%252C%2BCC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Thanh, LD",Jun 2020 ,A Physically Based Model for the Streaming Potential Coupling Coefficient in Partially Saturated Porous Media,WATER,"The electrokinetics methods have great potential to characterize hydrogeological processes in porous media, especially in complex partially saturated hydrosystems (e.g., the vadose zone). The dependence of the streaming coupling coefficient on water saturation remains highly debated in both theoretical and experimental works. In this work, we propose a physically based model for the streaming potential coupling coefficient in porous media during the flow of water and air under partially saturated conditions. The proposed model is linked to fluid electrical conductivity, water saturation, irreducible water saturation, and microstructural parameters of porous materials. In particular, the surface conductivity of porous media has been taken into account in the model. In addition, we also obtain an expression for the characteristic length scale at full saturation in this work. The proposed model is successfully validated using experimental data from literature. A relationship between the streaming potential coupling coefficient and the effective excess charge density is also obtained in this work and the result is the same as those proposed in literature using different approaches. The model proposes a simple and efficient way to model the streaming potential generation for partially saturated porous media and can be useful for hydrogeophysical studies in the critical zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000554675700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1588%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BPhysically%2BBased%2BModel%2Bfor%2Bthe%2BStreaming%2BPotential%2BCoupling%2BCoefficient%2Bin%2BPartially%2BSaturated%2BPorous%2BMedia%26rft.aufirst%3DLuong%26rft.auinit%3DLD%26rft.aulast%3DDuy%2BThanh%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12061588%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DThanh%252C%2BLD%26rft.au%3DJougnot%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DHien%252C%2BNT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
23,"Cardenas, MB",May 2015 ,Hyporheic zone hydrologic science: A historical account of its emergence and a prospectus,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone, defined by shallow subsurface pathways through river beds and banks beginning and ending at the river, is an integral and unique component of fluvial systems. It hosts myriad hydrologically controlled processes that are potentially coupled in complex ways. Understanding these processes and the connections between them is critical since these processes are not only important locally but integrate to impact increasingly larger scale biogeochemical functioning of the river corridor up to the river network scale. Thus, the hyporheic zone continues to be a growing research focus for many hydrologists for more than half the history of Water Resources Research. This manuscript partly summarizes the historical development of hyporheic zone hydrologic science as gleaned from papers published in Water Resources Research, from the birth of the concept of the hyporheic zone as a hydrologic black box ( sometimes referred to as transient storage zone), to its adolescent years of being torn between occasionally competing research perspectives of interrogating the hyporheic zone from a surface or subsurface view, to its mature emergence as an interdisciplinary research field that employs the wide array of state-of-the-art tools available to the modern hydrologist. The field is vibrant and moving in the right direction of addressing critical fundamental and applied questions with no clear end in sight in its growth. There are exciting opportunities for scientists that are able to tightly link the allied fields of geology, geomorphology, hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology to tackle the many open problems in hyporheic zone science.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000357833600033,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bzone%2Bhydrologic%2Bscience%253A%2BA%2Bhistorical%2Baccount%2Bof%2Bits%2Bemergence%2Band%2Ba%2Bprospectus%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BBayani%26rft.auinit%3DMB%26rft.aulast%3DCardenas%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017028%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D3616%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3601-3616%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3601%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
24,"Clilverd, HM",Nov 2016 ,Coupled Hydrological/Hydraulic Modelling of River Restoration Impacts and Floodplain Hydrodynamics,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Channelization and embankment of rivers has led to major ecological degradation of aquatic habitats worldwide. River restoration can be used to restore favourable hydrological conditions for target species or processes. However, the effects of river restoration on hydraulic and hydrological processes are complex and are often difficult to determine because of the long-term monitoring required before and after restoration works. Our study is based on rarely available, detailed pre-restoration and post-restoration hydrological data collected from a wet grassland meadow in Norfolk, UK, and provides important insights into the hydrological effects of river restoration. Groundwater hydrology and climate were monitored from 2007 to 2010. Based on our data, we developed coupled hydrological/hydraulic models of pre-embankment and post-embankment conditions using the MIKE-SHE/MIKE 11 system. Simulated groundwater levels compared well with observed groundwater. Removal of the river embankments resulted in widespread floodplain inundation at high river flows (>1.7m(3)s(-1)) and frequent localized flooding at the river edge during smaller events (>0.6m(3)s(-1)). Subsequently, groundwater levels were higher and subsurface storage was greater. The restoration had a moderate effect on flood peak attenuation and improved free drainage to the river. Our results suggest that embankment removal can increase river-floodplain hydrological connectivity to form a more natural wetland ecotone, driven by frequent localized flood disturbance. This has important implications for the planning and management of river restoration projects that aim to enhance floodwater storage, floodplain species composition and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.

25,"Schild, R",Nov 15 2001 ,Coupling of biomass production and sedimentation of suspended sediments in eutrophic rivers,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"In eutrophic rivers, not only the hydraulic processes (e.g. turbulent flow, deposition, resuspension) but also the biological ones (e.g. primary production, metabolic losses, grazing, decomposition and agglomeration) show a great influence on the dynamics of the total suspended sediments. On the other hand, because of the light limitation, the primary production itself is strongly dependent on the actual suspended matter concentration. In the present paper, model approaches to the biological and hydraulic coupling are assessed and discussed in comparison with measuring data. The coupling approaches have been developed and fixed in the model system PAMIR-C, which combines both the hydrobiological and the hydraulic effects by means of coupled algebraic and differential equations. We used PAMIR-C to simulate the concentration development over 3 years in a well-examined compartment of the Spree River near Berlin, Germany. The simulation runs show, that the primary production as well as the hydraulic regime have a great influence on the mean particle properties, and thereby on the mean settling velocity of the suspended particles. Moreover, they both regulate the existence and availability of resuspendible sediments in the river bed. So, via the deposition and resuspension of sediments, both the hydraulic and hydrobiological effects proved to be highly relevant for the concentration development in eutrophic rivers.

26,"Briggs, MA",Oct 1 2019 ,Return flows from beaver ponds enhance floodplain-to-river metals exchange in alluvial mountain catchments,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River to floodplain hydrologic connectivity is strongly enhanced by beaver- (Castor canadensis) engineered channel water diversions. The hydroecological impacts are wide ranging and generally positive, however, the hydrogeochemical characteristics of beaver-induced flowpaths have not been thoroughly examined. Using a suite of complementary ground- and drone-based heat tracing and remote sensing methodology we characterized the physical template of beaver-induced floodplain exchange for two alluvial mountain streams near Crested Butte, Colorado, USA. A flowpath-oriented perspective to water quality sampling allowed characterization of the chemical evolution of channel water diverted through floodplain beaver ponds and ultimately back to the channel in 'beaver pond return flows'. Subsurface return flow seepages were universally suboxic, while ponds and surface return flows showed a range of oxygen concentration due to in-situ photosynthesis and atmospheric mixing. Median concentrations of reduced metals: manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and arsenic (As) were substantially higher along beaver-induced flowpaths than in geologically controlled seepages and upstream main channel locations. The areal footprint of reduced return seepage flowpaths were imaged with surface electromagnetic methods, indicating extensive zones of high-conductivity shallow groundwater flowing back toward the main channels and emerging at relatively warm bank seepage zones observed with infrared. Multiple-depth redox dynamics within one focused seepage zone showed coupled variation over time, likely driven by observed changes in seepage rate that may be controlled by pond stage. High-resolution times series of dissolved Mn and Fe collected downstream of the beaver-impacted reaches demonstrated seasonal dynamics in mixed river metal concentrations. Al time series concentrations showed proportional change to Fe at the smaller stream location, indicating chemically reduced flowpaths were sourcing Al to the channel. Overall our results indicated beaver-induced floodplain exchanges create important, and perhaps dominant, transport pathways for floodplain metals by expanding chemically-reduced zones paired with strong advective exchange.

27,"Qin, J",Oct 2017 ,Sediment exchange between groin fields and main-stream,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Sediment exchange between groin fields and the main-stream influences the transport and distribution of polluted sediment that represents a hazard for rivers and neighboring floodplains. Despite its practical significance, little research has been done on the sediment exchange process itself, and existing studies used to estimate the sediment exchange by morphological change. The sediment exchange process, however, differs from morphological variation and includes two behaviors: the entrance of main-stream sediment into groin fields and the movement of groin field sediment out of groin fields. Therefore, this study aims at examining this exchange process and exploring the mechanisms of different exchange phenomena. Experiments were conducted in a mobile-bed laboratory flume by using a novel experimental method that successfully separates the movement of groin fields sediment from that of main-stream sediment. In addition to traditional measurements, such as measurements of morphological changes, surface flow velocities, and bed-form propagation, the deposition of main-stream sediment in groin fields is measured in detail. The results demonstrate that morphological change cannot reflect the sediment exchange process. The deposition of main-stream sediment in groin fields is determined by the dynamics of sediment movement, in which bedload-and suspended-sediment-dominated processes exhibit different deposition patterns. The movement of groin field sediment out of groin fields is determined mainly by local scouring around groins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

28,"Malcolm, IA",Feb 2009 ,Fine scale variability of hyporheic hydrochemistry in salmon spawning gravels with contrasting groundwater-surface water interactions,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"There is increasing realisation of the importance of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions in understanding freshwater ecology. A study that assessed the influence of local GW-SW interactions on shallow (< 250mm) hyporheic water quality at two contrasting salmon spawning locations in Scotland, UK is reported. At a groundwater-dominated site, continuous logging sensors revealed that hyporheic dissolved oxygen ( DO) concentrations changed rapidly in response to changing hydrological conditions. Low volume (25ml) spot samples revealed fine-scale spatial variability (< 0.05m) consistent with a vertically shifting boundary layer between source waters. At a surface-water-dominated location, hyporheic water was typically characterised by high DO and electrical conductivity values, characteristic of surface water. Small reductions in DO at this site are hypothesised to be associated with short residence hyporheic discharge. A comparison between in-situ ( logging DO sensor data) and ex-situ ( small volume sampling) methods revealed good agreement, potentially allowing deployment of the two methods in stratified sampling programmes. This study demonstrates that hyporheic water quality varies over fine spatial and temporal scales and that future studies need to design sampling strategies that consider the scales appropriate to both the ecology and the hyporheic processes of interest.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000262971600013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFine%2Bscale%2Bvariability%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bhydrochemistry%2Bin%2Bsalmon%2Bspawning%2Bgravels%2Bwith%2Bcontrasting%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Binteractions%26rft.aufirst%3DI.%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DIA%26rft.aulast%3DMalcolm%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-008-0339-5%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D174%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D161-174%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D161%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DMalcolm%252C%2BIA%26rft.au%3DSoulsby%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DTetzlaff%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
29,"Vasilevskiy, P",Apr 2022 ,Simulating River/Lake-Groundwater Exchanges in Arid River Basins: An Improvement Constrained by Lake Surface Area Dynamics and Evapotranspiration,REMOTE SENSING,"Surface water-groundwater interactions in arid zones are characterized by water exchange processes in a complex system comprising intermittent streams/terminal lakes, shallow aquifers, riparian zone evapotranspiration, and groundwater withdrawal. Notable challenges arise when simulating such hydrological systems; for example, field observations are scarce, and hydrogeological parameters exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity. To reduce the simulation uncertainties, in addition to groundwater head and river discharge measurements, we adopted remote sensing-based evapotranspiration data and lake area dynamics as known conditions to calibrate the model. We chose the Ejina Basin, located in the lower reaches of the Heihe River Basin in arid northwest China, as the study area to validate our modelling approach. The hydrological system of this basin is characterized by intensive, spatiotemporally variable surface water-groundwater interactions. The areas of the terminal lakes into which all river runoff flows vary significantly depending on the ratio between river runoff and lake evaporation. Simulation results with a monthly time step from 2000 to 2017 indicate that river leakage accounted for approximately 61% of the total river runoff. Our study shows that for areas where surface water and groundwater observations are sparse, combining remote sensing product data of surface water areas and evapotranspiration can effectively reduce the uncertainty in coupled surface water and groundwater simulations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000781535500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1657%26rft.atitle%3DSimulating%2BRiver%252FLake-Groundwater%2BExchanges%2Bin%2BArid%2BRiver%2BBasins%253A%2BAn%2BImprovement%2BConstrained%2Bby%2BLake%2BSurface%2BArea%2BDynamics%2Band%2BEvapotranspiration%26rft.aufirst%3DPeter%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DVasilevskiy%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Frs14071657%26rft.eissn%3D2072-4292%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DREMOTE%2BSENSING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DREMOTE%2BSENS-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DVasilevskiy%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DYu%252C%2BJJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=REMOTE+SENSING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
30,"Bednarik, A",Aug 2015 ,Contribution of Methane Benthic and Atmospheric Fluxes of an Experimental Area (Sitka Stream),CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER,"Contributions of methane benthic fluxes and methane emissions to the total methane amount were studied during the summer season for two consecutive years. Considering the fact that methane is produced in great amount within hyporheic sediments, we have expected that both methane released by the benthic fluxes into the overlying water and methane emitted to the atmosphere should significantly affect the total methane budget of the stream water within the experimental area. In order to asses this assumption, we measured methane concentrations within the vertical sediment profile of a hyporheic zone, direct benthic methane fluxes by static chambers, methane concentrations in the surface water, and methane emissions into the atmosphere simultaneously. The methane concentrations in interstitial water tended sharply to increase with sediment depth (0.54-734.99 mu mol L-1) and were strongly correlated with benthic fluxes (r = 0.88, p<0.05). We also found a considerable variability in the benthic methane fluxes (0-12.59 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and the spatial variability (0-71.43%) of the experimental area, suggesting that there may be various factors that affect the rate of benthic fluxes including methanotrophy in the top sediment layers. Generally, the contribution of benthic fluxes and methane emissions to the methane budgets of the experimental area was negligible (0.034 (0.45%) and 0.074 mol day(-1) (0.98%), respectively).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000359083500003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DContribution%2Bof%2BMethane%2BBenthic%2Band%2BAtmospheric%2BFluxes%2Bof%2Ban%2BExperimental%2BArea%2B%2528Sitka%2BStream%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DBednarik%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fclen.201300982%26rft.eissn%3D1863-0669%26rft.epage%3D1142%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-0650%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DCLEAN-SOIL%2BAIR%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1136-1142%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1136%26rft.stitle%3DCLEAN-SOIL%2BAIR%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DBednarik%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DCap%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DRulik%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=CLEAN-SOIL+AIR+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Thus, the lentic waters of gravel-pit lakes connected with the River Rhine represent highly productive spawning and nursery areas even for rheophilous species of fish, so that they may be of great importance for the recruitment of the River Rhine's fish populations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1994NU83300049,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DREPRODUCTION%2BOF%2BFISH%2BIN%2BTHE%2BLOWER%2BRIVER%2BRHINE%2BAND%2BCONNECTED%2BGRAVEL-PIT%2BLAKES%26rft.aufirst%3DS%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DSTAAS%26rft.date%3D1994%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fwst.1994.0127%26rft.epage%3D313%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0273-1223%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D311-313%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D311%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DSTAAS%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DNEUMANN%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=WATER+SCIENCE+AND+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
32,"Marce, R",Aug 15 2008 ,"Modelling river water temperature using deterministic, empirical, and hybrid formulations in a Mediterranean stream",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"River water temperature is a common target of water quality models at the watershed scale, owing to its principal role in shaping biogeochemical processes and in stream ecology. Usually, models include physically-based, deterministic formulations to calculate water temperatures from detailed meteorological information, which usually comes from meteorological stations located far from the river reaches. However, alternative empirical approaches have been proposed, that usually depend oil air temperature as master variable. This Study explored the performance of a semidistributed water quality application modelling river water temperature in a Mediterranean watershed, using three different approaches. First, a deterministic approach was used accounting for the different heat exchange components usually considered in water temperature models. Second, an empirical approximation was applied using the equilibrium temperature concept, assuming a linear relationship with air temperature. And third, a hybrid approach was constructed, in which the temperature equilibrium concept and the deterministic approach were combined. Results showed that the hybrid approach gave the best results, followed by the empirical approximation. The deterministic formulation gave the worst results. The hybrid approach not only fitted daily river water temperatures, but also adequately modelled the daily temperature range (maximum-minimum daily temperature). Other river water features directly dependent oil water temperature, such as river intrusion depth in lentic systems (i.e. the depth at which the river inflow plunges to equilibrate density differences with lake water), were also correctly modelled even at hourly time steps. However, results for the different heat fluxes between river and atmosphere were very unrealistic. Although direct evidence of discrepancies between meteorological drivers measured at the meteorological stations and the actual river microclimate was not found, the use of models including empirical or hybrid formulations depending mainly oil air temperature is recommended if only meteorological data from locations far from the river reaches are available.

33,"Alam, MK",Nov 2020 ,Stable isotope ratios of emergent adult aquatic insects can be used as indicators of water pollution in the hyporheic food web,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Bio-assessment protocols for the subsurface domain of river channels (i.e. hyporheic zone) are scarce despite of the known importance of its ecological function in river ecosystems. The larvae of the Alloperla ishikariana Plecoptera species inhabit the hyporheic zone. Therefore, we examined whether emergent adult A. ishikariana could serve as proxy indicators of the effects of pollution in the hyporheic food web. The study site comprised a 15-km stretch of a gravel bed river in Hokkaido, Japan, from which all invertebrates were collected from the riverbed at a depth of 30-50 cm, and emergent A. ishikariana adults were sampled in riparian zones. Water quality changed gradually along the river owing to the effects of a wastewater treatment plant and surrounding land uses. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios (SIRs) of epilithic biofilms, hyporheic particulate organic matter (POM), benthic POM, and invertebrates were used to determine the major basal carbon sources, the effects of water pollution on the hyporheic zone, and the trophic positions of dominant invertebrates. Generalized linear (mixed) models were used for statistical testing and modeling. Amphipoda and the larvae of A. ishikariana were considered as top predators and secondary consumers in the hyporheic food web, respectively. The observed similarity in water quality between the hyporheic and surface water suggested a large degree of hydrological exchange between the two zones, and resulted in positive increases in the nitrogen SIRs of hyporheic invertebrates, including A. ishikariana larvae, in proportion to nitrate levels in the surface water. The nitrogen SIRs of A. ishikariana adults were significantly correlated with the nitrogen SIRs of their larvae within the same location (adjusted R-2 = 0.78), indicating that emerged adults can provide information on the longitudinal variability of the effects of synthetic nitrogen. In contrast, the carbon SIRs of adults did not predict those of their larvae, possibly reflecting the diverse feeding habitats of larvae. Overall, we demonstrated that adult aquatic insects emerging from the hyporheic zone can be used as indirect indicators of pollution-associated nutrient assimilation as well as the spatial heterogeneity of dietary carbon resources in hyporheic food web.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000578967500035,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B106738%26rft.atitle%3DStable%2Bisotope%2Bratios%2Bof%2Bemergent%2Badult%2Baquatic%2Binsects%2Bcan%2Bbe%2Bused%2Bas%2Bindicators%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bpollution%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bfood%2Bweb%26rft.aufirst%3DMd.%2BKhorshed%26rft.auinit%3DMK%26rft.aulast%3DAlam%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecolind.2020.106738%26rft.eissn%3D1872-7034%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1470-160X%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BINDICATORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BINDIC%26rft.volume%3D118%26rft.au%3DAlam%252C%2BMK%26rft.au%3DNegishi%252C%2BJN%26rft.au%3DTolod%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+INDICATORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
34,"Wildhaber, YS",Feb 1 2014 ,"Effects of river morphology, hydraulic gradients, and sediment deposition on water exchange and oxygen dynamics in salmonid redds",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Fine sediment decreasing gravel permeability and oxygen supply to incubating salmonid embryos, is often considered the main contributing factor for the observed decline of salmonid populations. However, oxygen supply to salmonid embryos also depends on hydraulic conditions driving water flow through the redd. A more generalized perspective is needed to better understand the constraints on successful salmonid incubation in the many heavily modified fluvial ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere. The effects of hydraulic gradients, riverbed and redd morphology as well as fine sediment deposition on dissolved oxygen (DO) and water exchange was studied in 18 artificial redds at three sites along a modified river. Fifty percent of the redds in the two downstream sites were lost during high flow events, while redd loss at the upstream site was substantially lower (8%). This pattern was likely related to increasing flood heights from up- to downstream. Specific water infiltration rates (q) and DO were highly dynamic and driven on multiple temporal and spatial scales. Temporally, the high permeability of the redd gravel and the typical pit-tail structure of the new built redds, leading to high DO, disappeared within a month, when fine sediment had infiltrated and the redd structure was leveled. On the scale of hours to days, DO concentrations and q increased during high flows, but decreased during the falling limb of the water level, most likely related to exfiltration of oxygen depleted groundwater or hyporheic water. DO concentrations also decreased under prolonged base flow conditions, when increased infiltration of silt and clay particles clogged the riverbed and reduced q. Spatially, artificial log steps affected fine sediment infiltration, q and interstitial DO in the redds. The results demonstrate that multiple factors have to be considered for successful river management in salmonid streams, including riverbed structure and local and regional hydrogeological conditions.

35,"Chen, WB",May 1 2013 ,Coupling of a one-dimensional river routing model and a three-dimensional ocean model to predict overbank flows in a complex river-ocean system,APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING,"River-ocean coupled models were developed to calculate overbank flows in a complex river-coastal ocean system comprising the Wu River and the adjacent coastal ocean of central Taiwan. The hydrodynamic quantities were exchanged between one-dimensional and three-dimensional domains during runtime to resolve the real-time exchange and interaction between the coastal waters and the river system. The coupled model was calibrated and verified with the observed water levels using data from three typhoon events. The results indicate a reasonable agreement between the model simulations and the observed data. The model was then used to calculate hydrographs of the overbank flow caused by Typhoon Kalmaegi, which occurred in 2008. The simulated overbank flows quantitatively agreed with the reported information. We also demonstrated that most of the overbank flows occurred at the upper reaches of the tributaries of the Wu River system, except for the tributary in the Fazi River. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

36,"Zarnetske, JP",Nov 7 2012 ,Coupled transport and reaction kinetics control the nitrate source-sink function of hyporheic zones,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The fate of biologically available nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in stream ecosystems is controlled by the coupling of physical transport and biogeochemical reaction kinetics. However, determining the relative role of physical and biogeochemical controls at different temporal and spatial scales is difficult. The hyporheic zone (HZ), where groundwater-stream water mix, can be an important location controlling N and C transformations because it creates strong gradients in both the physical and biogeochemical conditions that control redox biogeochemistry. We evaluated the coupling of physical transport and biogeochemical redox reactions by linking an advection, dispersion, and residence time model with a multiple Monod kinetics model simulating the concentrations of oxygen (O-2), ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We used global Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses with a nondimensional form of the model to examine coupled nitrification-denitrification dynamics across many scales of transport and reaction conditions. Results demonstrated that the residence time of water in the HZ and the uptake rate of O-2 from either respiration and/or nitrification determined whether the HZ was a source or a sink of NO3 to the stream. We further show that whether the HZ is a net NO3 source or net NO3 sink is determined by the ratio of the characteristic transport time to the characteristic reaction time of O-2 (i.e., the Damkohler number, Da(O2)), where HZs with Da(O2) < 1 will be net nitrification environments and HZs with Da(O2) << 1 will be net denitrification environments. Our coupling of the hydrologic and biogeochemical limitations of N transformations across different temporal and spatial scales within the HZ allows us to explain the widely contrasting results of previous investigations of HZ N dynamics which variously identify the HZ as either a net source or sink of NO3. Our model results suggest that only estimates of residence times and O-2 uptake rates are necessary to predict this nitrification-denitrification threshold and, ultimately, whether a HZ will be either a net source or sink of NO3.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000310961300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW11508%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Btransport%2Band%2Breaction%2Bkinetics%2Bcontrol%2Bthe%2Bnitrate%2Bsource-sink%2Bfunction%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%26rft.aufirst%3DJay%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DZarnetske%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2012WR011894%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DHaggerty%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DGonzalez-Pinzon%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

38,"Vivien, R",Apr 10 2019 ,Assessment of the effects of wastewater treatment plant effluents on receiving streams using oligochaete communities of the porous matrix,KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS,"Human activities can disturb the natural dynamics of exchanges between surface water and groundwater in rivers. Such exchanges contribute to the self-purification of the environment and an excess of infiltration can lead to contamination of groundwater. In addition, the porous matrix (coarse surface sediments and hyporheic zone), through which water exchanges occur, is a sink for pollutants. For environmental monitoring programs, it is therefore essential to take into account both the dynamics of vertical hydrological exchanges and the biological quality of this matrix. The functional trait (FTR) method, which is based on the study of oligochaete communities in coarse surface sediments and the hyporheic zone, was proposed as a tool to simultaneously assess the dynamics of vertical hydrological exchanges and the effects of pollutants present in the porous matrix. Here, we applied this method during two different periods (in March and September 2016), upstream and downstream of locations affected by discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) located in Switzerland. The biological quality of surface sediments and the hyporheic zone was shown to be better upstream of the WWTP in both campaigns. In addition, results suggested that the capacity for self-purification was lower downstream of the WWTP, and that groundwater at these locations was vulnerable to pollution by surface water. The FTR method proved valuable as a field method for detecting the effects of point source contamination on receiving streams. In the near future, this community-based approach will benefit from advances in the use of DNA barcodes for oligochaete species identification.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000464057300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B18%26rft.atitle%3DAssessment%2Bof%2Bthe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bwastewater%2Btreatment%2Bplant%2Beffluents%2Bon%2Breceiving%2Bstreams%2Busing%2Boligochaete%2Bcommunities%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bporous%2Bmatrix%26rft.aufirst%3DRegis%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DVivien%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Fkmae%252F2019011%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1961-9502%26rft.issue%3D420%26rft.jtitle%3DKNOWLEDGE%2BAND%2BMANAGEMENT%2BOF%2BAQUATIC%2BECOSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DKNOWL%2BMANAG%2BAQUAT%2BEC%26rft.au%3DVivien%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DLafont%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DFerrari%252C%2BBJD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=KNOWLEDGE+AND+MANAGEMENT+OF+AQUATIC+ECOSYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Tested concentrations were 30 mu g.L-1 of Diuron diluted in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 2 mu g.L-1 of Dimethomorph and 0.1 mu g.L-1 of Chlorpyrifos-ethyl. To characterise the detoxification efficiency of the system, we performed genotoxicity bioassays in amphibian larvae and rotifers and measured the respiration and denitrification of sediments. Although the presence of biofilm increased the production of N-(3,4 dichloropheny1)-N-(methyl)-urea, a metabolite of diuron, the toxicity did not decrease irrespective of the bioassay. In the presence of biofilm, Dimethomorph concentrations decreased compared with abiotic conditions, from 2 mu g.L-1 to 0.4 mu g.L-1 after 18 days of percolation. For both Dimethomorph and Chlorpyrifos-ethyl additions, assessment of detoxification level by the biofilm depended on the test used: detoxification effect was found with amphibian larvae bioassay and no detoxification was observed with the rotifer test. Heterotrophic biofilm exerts a major influence in the biochemical transformation of contaminants such as pesticides, suggesting that the interface between running water and sediment plays a role in self-purification of stream reaches.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000322859900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRole%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bheterotrophic%2Bbiofilm%2Bon%2Btransformation%2Band%2Btoxicity%2Bof%2Bpesticides%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DSanchez-Perez%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Flimn%252F2013041%26rft.eissn%3D2100-000X%26rft.epage%3D95%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-4088%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DANNALES%2BDE%2BLIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D87-95%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D87%26rft.stitle%3DANN%2BLIMNOL-INT%2BJ%2BLIM%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DSanchez-Perez%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DMontuelle%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DGerino%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=ANNALES+DE+LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
40,"Bickel, TO",2008 ,Impact of Didymosphenia geminata on hyporheic conditions in trout redds: reason for concern?,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) Schmidt (commonly called didymo) is an invasive diatom and of concern to fisheries managers in North America and more recently New Zealand. Didymo grows in thick mats in several river systems on the South Island of New Zealand, often smothering entire river beds. Salmonid eggs, deposited in gravel nests (redds), depend on constant water exchange across the riverbed to provide oxygen-rich water for development. Thick didymo mats might restrict the flow of oxygen-rich water into spawning gravels, resulting in increased egg mortality and reduced trout recruitment. The present study measured hyporheic hydraulic conditions in trout redds with varying didymo cover in the Clutha River catchment, South Island, New Zealand. Didymo cover had no significant effects on several hydraulic variables (flow into the substrate, hydraulic conductivity and hyporheic oxygen concentration). However, there was a significant difference in the potential surface water-groundwater exchange between sites, suggesting some effect of didymo on hydraulic conditions. Considering the limited number of replicates, the impact of didymo on trout redds in the Clutha River cannot be excluded. The present study highlights the need for further research on the possible effects of didymo on important surface water-groundwater exchange processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000261175400007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2BDidymosphenia%2Bgeminata%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bconditions%2Bin%2Btrout%2Bredds%253A%2Breason%2Bfor%2Bconcern%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DTobias%2BO.%26rft.auinit%3DTO%26rft.aulast%3DBickel%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FMF08011%26rft.eissn%3D1448-6059%26rft.epage%3D1033%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1323-1650%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1028-1033%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1028%26rft.stitle%3DMAR%2BFRESHWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D59%26rft.au%3DBickel%252C%2BTO%26rft.au%3DCloss%252C%2BGP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The riverbank and streambed focused in this investigation are a riverbank of six layers with depths of 38m and streambed with depths of 9m connected layers of sediments at 22 test locations and 4 test wells in the Muda River, Malaysia. In the analysis, there were a few tests involved to determine riverbank and hydraulic conductivity of vertical streambed, such as analysis of grain size, pumping test and in situ falling head standpipe permeability tests. The approximate K values of 114 samples and 15 samples taken from riverbanks and streambeds, respectively, were then calculated by employing empirical equation methods [Hazen, Hazen K (cm/s)=d10 (mm), Terzaghi, Beyer, Slichter, Sauerbrei, Kruger, Kozeny-Carman, Zunker, USBR, Zamarin, Barr, Alyamani and Sen, Chapuis, and Krumbein and Monk]. The geometric mean of K for six layers, namely the sandy silt (8.30m/day), silty sand (47.66m/day), gravelly sand (150.24m/day), sandy gravel layer (418.48m/day), gravelly sand (151.09m/day) and silty clay (9.36m/day) as identified characteristics by using grain-size analyses, was greater than the K of pumping test (geometric mean) (31.10m/day) and the mean obtained from K of permeability tests (7.03m/day). In general, the K values of upper layer of sediments of streambed were recorded to be larger in comparison with their respective lower layer of sediments. The K value for the upper layer of sediments from all tests located at the left, right and middle parts of the river ranged from 7.56 to 54.77m/day for upper layer, from 39.80 to 128.40m/day for middle layer and from 9.11 to 49.92m/day for lower layer, as described by the grain-size analysis. The value of K ranges based on permeability test indicated that the value of K was from 0.036 to 1.09m/day for the upper layer and 0.16 to 0.68m/day for the lower layer of hyporheic sediments zone. Based on the acquired results, the conclusion that the aquifer of the focused area shows possibility for RBF and has the potential to improve the water quality and quantity is referable.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000453326700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B8%26rft.atitle%3DVertical%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bof%2Briverbank%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bsediment%2Bat%2BMuda%2BRiver%2Briverbank%2Bfiltration%2Bsite%252C%2BMalaysia%26rft.aufirst%3DMohd%2BKhairul%2BNizar%26rft.auinit%3DMKN%26rft.aulast%3DShamsuddin%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs13201-018-0880-x%26rft.eissn%3D2190-5495%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2190-5487%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BWATER%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DShamsuddin%252C%2BMKN%26rft.au%3DSulaiman%252C%2BWNA%26rft.au%3DKusin%252C%2BFM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+WATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Marmonier, P",2012 ,"The role of organisms in hyporheic processes: gaps in current knowledge, needs for future research and applications",ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"Fifty years after the hyporheic zone was first defined (Orghidan, 1959), there are still gaps in the knowledge regarding the role of biodiversity in hyporheic processes. First, some methodological questions remained unanswered regarding the interactions between biodiversity and physical processes, both for the study of habitat characteristics and interactions at different scales. Furthermore, many questions remain to be addressed to help inform our understanding of invertebrate community dynamics, especially regarding the trophic niches of organisms, the functional groups present within sediment, and their temporal changes. Understanding microbial community dynamics would require investigations about their relationship with the physical characteristics of the sediment, their diversity, their relationship with metabolic pathways, their interactions with invertebrates, and their response to environmental stress. Another fundamental research question is that of the importance of the hyporheic zone in the global metabolism of the river, which must be explored in relation to organic matter recycling, the effects of disturbances, and the degradation of contaminants. Finally, the application of this knowledge requires the development of methods for the estimation of hydrological exchanges, especially for the management of sediment clogging, the optimization of self-purification, and the integration of climate change in environmental policies. The development of descriptors of hyporheic zone health and of new metrology is also crucial to include specific targets in water policies for the long-term management of the system and a clear evaluation of restoration strategies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000310754500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Brole%2Bof%2Borganisms%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bprocesses%253A%2Bgaps%2Bin%2Bcurrent%2Bknowledge%252C%2Bneeds%2Bfor%2Bfuture%2Bresearch%2Band%2Bapplications%26rft.aufirst%3DP.%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DMarmonier%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Flimn%252F2012009%26rft.eissn%3D2100-000X%26rft.epage%3D266%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-4088%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DANNALES%2BDE%2BLIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D253-266%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D253%26rft.stitle%3DANN%2BLIMNOL-INT%2BJ%2BLIM%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DArchambaud%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DVervier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=ANNALES+DE+LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Freeman, MC",Feb 2007 ,Hydrologic connectivity and the contribution of stream headwaters to ecological integrity at regional scales,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Cumulatively, headwater streams contribute to maintaining hydrologic connectivity and ecosystem integrity at regional scales. Hydrologic connectivity is the water-mediated transport of matter, energy and organisms within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle. Headwater streams compose over two-thirds of total stream length in a typical river drainage and directly connect the upland and riparian landscape to the rest of the stream ecosystem. Altering headwater streams, e.g., by channelization, diversion through pipes, impoundment and burial, modifies fluxes between uplands and downstream river segments and eliminates distinctive habitats. The large-scale ecological effects of altering headwaters are amplified by land uses that alter runoff and nutrient loads to streams, and by widespread dam construction on larger rivers (which frequently leaves free-flowing upstream portions of river systems essential to sustaining aquatic biodiversity). We discuss three examples of large-scale consequences of cumulative headwater alteration. Downstream eutrophication and coastal hypoxia result, in part, from agricultural practices that alter headwaters and wetlands while increasing nutrient runoff. Extensive headwater alteration is also expected to lower secondary productivity of river systems by reducing stream-system length and trophic subsidies to downstream river segments, affecting aquatic communities and terrestrial wildlife that utilize aquatic resources. Reduced viability of freshwater biota may occur with cumulative headwater alteration, including for species that occupy a range of stream sizes but for which headwater streams diversify the network of interconnected populations or enhance survival for particular life stages. Developing a more predictive understanding of ecological patterns that may emerge on regional scales as a result of headwater alterations will require studies focused on components and pathways that connect headwaters to river, coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Linkages between headwaters and downstream ecosystems cannot be discounted when addressing large-scale issues such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and global losses of biodiversity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000244429900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bconnectivity%2Band%2Bthe%2Bcontribution%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bheadwaters%2Bto%2Becological%2Bintegrity%2Bat%2Bregional%2Bscales%26rft.aufirst%3DMary%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DMC%26rft.aulast%3DFreeman%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1752-1688.2007.00002.x%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D14%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5-14%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DFreeman%252C%2BMC%26rft.au%3DPringle%252C%2BCM%26rft.au%3DJackson%252C%2BCR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
44,"Nogaro, G",Dec 2013 ,Influence of hyporheic zone characteristics on the structure and activity of microbial assemblages,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"The hyporheic zone is a pivotal environment for biogeochemical processes in riverine ecosystems. However, the responses of hyporheic microbial assemblage structure and activity to environmental variables remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of hyporheic zone characteristics on microbial assemblages in three French rivers (Usses, Isere and Drome). For each river, microbial structure (assemblage composition and abundance) and activity were measured at three sites with contrasting environmental characteristics (e.g. effective streambed porosity, oxygen and nutrient concentrations). Firstly, we expected that the structure and activity of the hyporheic microbial assemblage would be significantly affected by the environmental characteristics of the hyporheic zone. We also expected a strong relationship between the structure and activity of hyporheic microbial communities in the Usses River, due to greater spatial heterogeneity (i.e. greater porosity differences between the studied sites) compared with the two other rivers. Our results showed that porosity reduction, greatest in the Usses River, affected the exchanges of flows and energy through the hyporheic zone and, consequently, led to a distinct microbial assemblage composition in comparison with the two other rivers. Significant relationships between bacterial assemblage structure and activity were detected for the Usses and Drome rivers, due to the greater spatial variability in sediment and physicochemical variables observed in these two rivers than in the Isere. Hyporheic zone characteristics (sediment permeability, water chemistry, particulate organic matter) appear to be the key factors controlling microbial structure and activity in riverine environments. As the hyporheic zone is essential for biogeochemical processes, including those attenuating pollution, a better quantification of the influences of environmental factors controlling microbial activity is needed to understand and predict ecosystem processes in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000326021800011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bcharacteristics%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bstructure%2Band%2Bactivity%2Bof%2Bmicrobial%2Bassemblages%26rft.aufirst%3DGeraldine%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DNogaro%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffwb.12233%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D2583%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2567-2583%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2567%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DNogaro%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DMontuelle%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Microbial metabolism is hypothesized to play a key role in pollutant transformation in hyporheic sediments of natural streams. However, previous work investigating the influence of microbial metabolism on pollutant transformation has been predominantly laboratory studies. The key challenge for field studies is the appropriate determination of net microbial metabolism, i.e. information on the actual exposure times to specific microbial processes in the investigated system. The present study uses reactive fluorescent tracers to determine microbial metabolism and ultimately its influence on pollutant transformation, e.g. for trace organic compounds, in hyporheic sediments under natural conditions. In particular, the reactive fluorescent tracers resazurin and its main transformation product resorufin were used to determine the microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes. The influence of the derived microbial metabolism on the transformation of 20 trace organic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals, including 3 parent-daughter pairs, was examined. The present findings validate laboratory results on the microbially-mediated transformation of the anticonvulsant gabapentin to its main transformation product gabapentin lactam under natural conditions. All other TrOCs investigated did not show a clear link between TrOC reactivity to the microbial metabolism informed by the resazurin-resorufin-system. Overall, the present study not only demonstrates the use of the fluorescent tracer-system resazurin and resorufin for determining microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes but also generally highlights the potential of reactive fluorescent tracers to disentangle specific reactive properties and ultimately their influence on the fate of pollutants in natural HZs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000858489400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B119056%26rft.atitle%3DFate%2Bof%2Btrace%2Borganic%2Bcompounds%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2BInfluence%2Bof%2Bmicrobial%2Bmetabolism%26rft.aufirst%3DAnja%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DHoehne%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.watres.2022.119056%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2448%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1354%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D224%26rft.au%3DHohne%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DMuller%252C%2BBM%26rft.au%3DMcCallum%252C%2BJL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

48,"Dehkordy, FM",Jun 2019 ,Multi-scale preferential flow processes in an urban streambed under variable hydraulic conditions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Spatially preferential flow processes occur at nested scales at the sediment-water interface (SWI), due in part to sediment heterogeneities, which may be enhanced in flashy urban streams with heavy road sand influence. However, several factors, including the flow-rate dependence of preferential hyporheic flow and discrete groundwater discharge zones are commonly overlooked in reach-scale models of groundwater/surface water exchange. Using a series of controlled-head tracer-injection experiments coupled with cm-scale geophysics within the highly reactive upper 30 cm of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream, we quantified the flow dependence of local less-mobile porosity volume, mass-transfer rate coefficient, and the resulting local residence time in the less-mobile pore space at three controlled downward fluid fluxes (0.8, 2, and 3 m/d). Experiments were performed in two adjacent streambed locations, representing different sediment bulk vertical permeability. Less-mobile porosity parameters were generally substantial and similar between the two streambed locations; though a more competent, thin, organic layer at similar to 15 cm depth in one location strongly impacted tracer loading, flushing dynamics, and local residence times. Increased downward flux led to (1) a decrease in less-mobile porosity residence time in all experiments, and (2) an increase in less-mobile porosity fraction for most experiments. Additionally, at the larger stream reach-scale, surface electrodes for electrical resistivity measurement were installed along 22 m of the wetted stream channel. These surface electrode measurements were collected during a natural storm flow event, which revealed widespread, short-term, flushing (e.g. < 3 h) of the hyporheic zone with stream water, followed by longer-term (e.g. > 60 h) flushing of the SWI with riparian zone groundwater. Flow dependence of preferential hyporheic zone flowpaths, like in the controlled tracer experiments, was also observed in these reach-scale electrical resistivity tomography measurements. Our findings reveal that the spatial and temporal dependence of preferential flow processes create highly dynamic SWI conditions that will affect the physical and coupled biogeochemical functions of the SWI in urbanized, sand-impacted streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000474327800013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMulti-scale%2Bpreferential%2Bflow%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Ban%2Burban%2Bstreambed%2Bunder%2Bvariable%2Bhydraulic%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DFarzaneh%2BMahmoodPoor%26rft.auinit%3DFM%26rft.aulast%3DDehkordy%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2019.03.022%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.epage%3D179%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D168-179%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D168%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D573%26rft.au%3DDehkordy%252C%2BFM%26rft.au%3DBriggs%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DBagtzoglou%252C%2BAC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Ping, X",Nov 2020 ,Effect of bioclogging on the nitrate source and sink function of a hyporheic zone,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Nitrogen dynamic in a hyporheic zone (HZ) is mediated by microbes in the form of biofilms attached to sediment grains. Previous studies have neglected the influence of microbial effects on hyporheic nitrate function despite the fact that biofilm-induced clogging can significantly reduce sediment permeability and affect both residence time distribution and biochemical reaction rates. In this study, to assess how the development of bioclogging affects the nitrate source and sink function of HZs, we established a numerical model by coupling water flow, reactive solute transport, and microbial metabolism to simulate nitrogen cycling in a dune-shaped streambed. The classic Damkohler number (Da(O2)) with an average reaction timescale was not appropriate to determine hyporheic function for the context of biofilm growth induced streambed permeability and biogeochemical reaction rates changing with time. We proposed a new Damkohler number (Da(O2)*) with a correction factor (the ratio between current bacteria and initial bacteria) to identify hyporheic function while accounting for the dynamic process of microbial growth. Our results demonstrated that bioclogging layers with aerobic bacteria aggregation acted as a nitrate source system with Da(O2)* >> 1, whereas deeper streambed with negligible microbiota survival severed as a nitrate sink with Da(O2)* < 1 when V-O2 = 1 h(-1). The threshold value of net nitrate source or sink system was influenced by maximum reaction rate of oxygen, and it was in a general range of 1-50 (the range of V-O2 was in 1-3 h(-1)). Threshold transition times from nitrate source to sink were evaluated from the spectrum of flow paths and had strong spatiotemporal variability due to microbial growth. The threshold times decreased over time and stabilized between 1.0 and 3.7 h (for V-O2 = 1 h(-1)) in a dune-shaped streambed when biofilm layers formed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000599754500144,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B125425%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Bbioclogging%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bnitrate%2Bsource%2Band%2Bsink%2Bfunction%2Bof%2Ba%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DXue%26rft.auinit%3DX%26rft.aulast%3DPing%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.125425%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D590%26rft.au%3DPing%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BMG%26rft.au%3DXian%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84TLbXpzB8nQvRG37BMCL&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
