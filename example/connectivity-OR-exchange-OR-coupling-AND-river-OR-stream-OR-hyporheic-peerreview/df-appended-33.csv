0,0,"Larsen, IJ",Jul 2012 ,Landslide erosion coupled to tectonics and river incision,NATURE GEOSCIENCE,"The steep topography of mountain landscapes arises from interactions among tectonic rock uplift, valley incision and landslide erosion on hillslopes. Hillslopes in rapidly uplifting landscapes are thought to respond to river incision into bedrock by steepening to a maximum stable or 'threshold' angle(1-3). Landslide erosion rates are predicted to increase nonlinearly as hillslope angles approach the threshold angle(1-7). However, the key tenet of this emerging threshold hillslope model of landscape evolution-the coupled response of landslide erosion to tectonic and fluvial forcing-remains untested. Here we quantify landslide erosion rates in the eastern Himalaya, based on mapping more than 15,000 landslides on satellite images. We show that landslide erosion rates are significantly correlated with exhumation rates and stream power and that small increases in mean hillslope angles beyond 30 degrees translate into large and significant increases in landslide erosion. Extensive landsliding in response to a large outburst flood indicates that lateral river erosion is a key driver of landslide erosion on threshold hillslopes. Our results confirm the existence of threshold hillslopes and demonstrate that an increase in landslide erosion rates, rather than steepened hillslope angles, is the primary mechanism by which steep uplands respond to and balance rapid rates of rock uplift and bedrock river incision in tectonically active mountain belts.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000307098400015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLandslide%2Berosion%2Bcoupled%2Bto%2Btectonics%2Band%2Briver%2Bincision%26rft.aufirst%3DIsaac%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DIJ%26rft.aulast%3DLarsen%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fngeo1479%26rft.epage%3D473%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1752-0894%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURE%2BGEOSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D468-473%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D468%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BGEOSCI%26rft.volume%3D5%26rft.au%3DLarsen%252C%2BIJ%26rft.au%3DMontgomery%252C%2BDR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=NATURE+GEOSCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1038/ngeo1479,,"ACTIVE MOUNTAIN-RANGES,BARWA-GYALA-PERI,THRESHOLD HILLSLOPES,TSANGPO GORGE,SEDIMENT FLUX,ROCK UPLIFT,EVOLUTION,HIMALAYA,TIBET,RATES",,"Univ Washington, Dept Earth & Space Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA"
1,1,"Oviedo-Vargas, D",Dec 2015 ,The effect of regional groundwater on carbon dioxide and methane emissions from a lowland rainforest stream in Costa Rica,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"In the tropical rainforest at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, regional bedrock groundwater high in dissolved carbon discharges into some streams and wetlands, with the potential for multiple cascading effects on ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes. We investigated carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) degassing from two streams at La Selva: the Arboleda, where approximately one third of the streamflow is from regional groundwater, and the Taconazo, fed exclusively by local groundwater recharged within the catchment. The regional groundwater inflow to the Arboleda had no measurable effect on stream gas exchange velocity, dissolved CH4 concentration, or CH4 emissions but significantly increased stream CO2 concentration and degassing. CO2 evasion from the reach of the Arboleda receiving regional groundwater (lower Arboleda) averaged 5.5molCm(-2)d(-1), similar to 7.5 times higher than the average (0.7molCm(-2)d(-1)) from the stream reaches with no regional groundwater inflow (the Taconazo and upper Arboleda). Carbon emissions from both streams were dominated by CO2; CH4 accounted for only 0.06-1.70% of the total (average of both streams: 5x10(-3)molCm(-2)d(-1)). Annual stream degassing fluxes normalized by watershed area were 48 and 299gCm(-2) for the Taconazo and Arboleda, respectively. CO2 degassing from the Arboleda is a significant carbon flux, similar in magnitude to the average net ecosystem exchange estimated by eddy covariance. Examining the effects of catchment connections to underlying hydrogeological systems can help avoid overestimation of ecosystem respiration and advance our understanding of carbon source/sink status and overall terrestrial ecosystem carbon budgets.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000368938500007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Beffect%2Bof%2Bregional%2Bgroundwater%2Bon%2Bcarbon%2Bdioxide%2Band%2Bmethane%2Bemissions%2Bfrom%2Ba%2Blowland%2Brainforest%2Bstream%2Bin%2BCosta%2BRica%26rft.aufirst%3DDiana%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DOviedo-Vargas%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015JG003009%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D2595%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2579-2595%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2579%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D120%26rft.au%3DOviedo-Vargas%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DGenereux%252C%2BDP%26rft.au%3DOberbauer%252C%2BSF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015JG003009,"carbon,greenhouse gas,streams,gas exchange,regional groundwater","DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS,NITROUS-OXIDE,INORGANIC CARBON,AMAZONIAN RIVERS,NITRIC-OXIDE,LA-SELVA,WATER,CO2,FLOW,FLUXES",,"N Carolina State Univ, Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA"
2,2,"Lin, Y",Oct 1 2011 ,Modelling transport and transformation of mercury fractions in heavily contaminated mountain streams by coupling a GIS-based hydrological model with a mercury chemistry model,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Many heavily polluted areas are located in remote regions that lack routine hydrologic monitoring. A modelling method that can produce scenarios of water chemistry trends for regions that lack hydrological data is therefore needed. The Wanshan mining area, in Guizhou province in south-western China, is such a region, as it is heavily polluted with mercury (Hg). In order to model Hg transport in a stream draining the Wanshan mining area, a Geographic Information System (GIS) hydrologic model (HEC-HMS) was coupled with a simulation model for Hg fractions in water (WASP Hg). Hydrological variations in the stream flow can thereby be simulated based on readily available precipitation data. The WASP 7 MERC Hg model was used for simulating variations in total Hg, dissolved Hg and methyl-Hg concentrations.The results of HEC-HMS modelling of flow show clear seasonal variation. Winter (Oct-Dec) constitutes the dry season with low flow, while the summer season (Jun-Aug) is rainy with high flow. 48% of total annual precipitation happens in the three summer months. The stream flows at the high flow events were several times higher than normal flow. The modelled total suspended solids and Hg concentrations were tested against monitoring data from two sampling campaigns conducted in September 2007 and August 2008. The model produced reasonable simulations for TSS, THg, DHg and MeHg, with relative errors generally around 10% for the modelled parameters. High flow events are the main contributors for release of both suspended particles and Hg. The three high flow events account for about 50% of annual discharge of THg. The annual total discharge of Hg was 8.8 kg Hg high up in the stream and 2.6 kg where the stream meets a large river 20 km downstream of the pollution source. Hence, about 70% of Hg is retained in the stream through sedimentation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

During the austral summer, glacial meltwater supports cyanobacterial mat communities in some streams, but they are not ubiquitous. We conducted a nitrate (NO3-) enrichment tracer injection in Huey Creek to quantify NO3- loss in a Dry Valley stream where algal mats would not obscure hyporheic microbial processes. Unsteady streamflow led to diel variability in the tracer concentration and in surface/subsurface water and solute exchange. Subsequently, concentrations of NO3-, nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied significantly during the injection, with a net loss of NO3-, NO2-, and DOC, and production of nitrous oxide. These mass changes within a reach were often coincident with high streamflows. Reactivity also coincided with the highest DOC concentrations, suggesting that DOC is the primary limitation to heterotrophic microbial activity in the stream. Together, streamflow and DOC availability create the hot spots and hot moments that dominate NO3- reactivity and removal in this polar desert ecosystem. The combination of spatially and temporally variable hyporheic dynamics and solute availability underscore the limitations of common nutrient uptake metrics and transient storage models when unsteady flow conditions exist.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000273507800002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG01001%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Bunsteady%2Bflow%2Bon%2Bnitrate%2Bloss%2Bin%2Ban%2Boligotrophic%252C%2Bglacial%2Bmeltwater%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DJoshua%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DJC%26rft.aulast%3DKoch%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009JG001030%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D115%26rft.au%3DKoch%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DBaeseman%252C%2BJL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2009JG001030,,"MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,TAYLOR VALLEY,TRANSIENT STORAGE,ANTARCTICA,ECOSYSTEM,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,GEOCHEMISTRY,INTERFACE,CHEMISTRY",,"Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80303 USA"
4,4,"Galia, T",,Spatiotemporal variations of large wood and river channel morphology in a rapidly degraded reach of an intermittent river,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"The links between rapid channel degradation and related large wood (LW) recruitment and storage are still not precisely understood, especially in aquatic systems with high human and natural pressures such as intermittent rivers in the peri-Mediterranean region. In this study, by using multidisciplinary research (analysis of satellite images time series, detailed field inventory, and simulated hydrological data), we focused on rapid upstream propagation of channel degradation (i.e., incision and consequent channel widening) in an intermittent Mediterranean river (Evrotas River, southern Greece) as a response to short-term intensive gravel extraction from the active channel and removal of riparian vegetation in the 2013-2016 period. Subsequently, our objective was to link this channel transformation with the spatiotemporal changes of LW storage in the active channel. We found that short-term and spatially limited human impact, coupled with high flows, allowed rapid upstream progression (similar to 2 km) of erosion processes (approximately twofold widening of the active channel) during the relatively short 2-year period (2017-2019). This morphological response accelerated LW recruitment through bank erosion and its subsequent storage in the active channel. Incision and channel widening processes were interrupted in the 2019-2021 period due to the prevalence of relatively low, geomorphologically non-effective flows. However, the storage of LW in the channel continued to increase as a result of the higher trapping efficiency of the widened channel, a delay between tree death and its final uprooting, or by LW recruitment processes not directly related to flood events. We suggest that freshly recruited LW has the potential to accelerate the establishment of a new channel equilibrium and increase channel heterogeneity through its interaction with flows and sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000908314400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2Bvariations%2Bof%2Blarge%2Bwood%2Band%2Briver%2Bchannel%2Bmorphology%2Bin%2Ba%2Brapidly%2Bdegraded%2Breach%2Bof%2Ban%2Bintermittent%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DTomas%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DGalia%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fesp.5531%26rft.eissn%3D1096-9837%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0197-9337%26rft.jtitle%3DEARTH%2BSURFACE%2BPROCESSES%2BAND%2BLANDFORMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DEARTH%2BSURF%2BPROC%2BLAND%26rft.au%3DGalia%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DSkarpich%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DSpalovsky%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=EARTH+SURFACE+PROCESSES+AND+LANDFORMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/esp.5531,"channel degradation,incision,intermittent river,large wood,Mediterranean,non-perennial stream","MEDITERRANEAN RIVERS,EPHEMERAL STREAM,HUMAN IMPACTS,ALPINE RIVER,FLOOD,MODEL,TRANSPORT,DEBRIS,SWAT,IDENTIFICATION",,"Univ Ostrava, Dept Phys Geog & Geoecol, Ostrava 70103, Czech Republic"
5,5,"Kobayashi, S",Apr 15 2022 ,"Local flow convergence, bed scour, and aquatic habitat formation during floods around wooden training structures placed on sand-gravel bars",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Riverine ponds, which are formed and sustained through sediment erosion and deposition, are key habitats for enhancing biodiversity in river reaches. The objective of this study was to understand the roles of traditional river-training wooden structures called ""seigyu"" on the formation of ponds on nonvegetated bars. Here, the spatial and temporal patterns of the flow and bedform coupled with pond formations for several flood events were assessed. The surface flow patterns were monitored by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and evaluated by large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV); the maximum flow velocities were 1.3 m s-1 and 1.9 m s-1 during floods when seigyu units were partially and fully submerged, respectively. Although the overall mean flow velocity was greater for the latter events, the spatial variation in flow velocity and dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) around seigyu was greater for the former events. Such flow patterns affected both bed formation and ecological habitats; ponds were formed at locations beside and behind seigyu, where the flow converged and bed scouring occurred during floods. The frequency and size of ponds around seigyu increased in the early half of the season, and they decreased in the other half when floods were greater in magnitude, which suggests that the bed scouring effect of seigyu was greater in flood stages with partial than fully submergence. Although the bar ponds lack shade to temper the effects of incident light and atmospheric conditions, the ponds displayed smaller daily oscillations in temperature than did the main river, probably due to hyporheic water supply to the ponds. Because many aquatic species cannot tolerate extremely high temperatures in summer, the generation and maintenance of deeper ponds by scouring with sufficient water exchange with the hyporheic zone can be key to enhancing colonization by various aquatic species.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000766808600011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B152992%26rft.atitle%3DLocal%2Bflow%2Bconvergence%252C%2Bbed%2Bscour%252C%2Band%2Baquatic%2Bhabitat%2Bformation%2Bduring%2Bfloods%2Baround%2Bwooden%2Btraining%2Bstructures%2Bplaced%2Bon%2Bsand-gravel%2Bbars%26rft.aufirst%3DSohei%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DKobayashi%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.scitotenv.2022.152992%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1026%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0048-9697%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENCE%2BOF%2BTHE%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D817%26rft.au%3DKobayashi%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DKantoush%252C%2BSA%26rft.au%3DSumi%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=SCIENCE+OF+THE+TOTAL+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.152992,"Gravel bars,River training structure,Scour holes,LSPIV,Submergence,Water temperature","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,FLOODPLAIN PONDS,LIFE-HISTORY,RIVER,STREAM,CONNECTIVITY,DIVERSITY,RESTORATION,SEDIMENT,DYNAMICS",,"Wenzhou Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China"

The closed-form solutions describing the variability in groundwater flow specific discharge and stream flow discharge are developed to quantify the influence of the variability in temporally correlated recharge in an unconfined aquifer on the stream flow discharge. We found from the closed-form solutions that the temporal correlation scale and the variance of recharge fields influence the variability in groundwater flow specific discharge and the stream flow discharge positively. In addition, the hydraulic diffusivity coefficient takes the role of reducing the variability in stream flow discharge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

7,7,"Doi, H",2007 ,Stream macroinvertebrate community affected by point-source metal pollution,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY,"The impacts of mining activities on aquatic biota have been documented in many stream ecosystems. In mining streams, point-source heavy metal pollution often appears in the stream. We hypothesize that this pollution is toxic to macroinvertebrates owing to high concentrations of metals and therefore affects macroinvertebrate community structure. We investigated macroinvertebrate community structure in mountain streams, including heavy metal-polluted sites and neutral-pH streams, to determine the relationship between community structure and environmental factors such as low pH and heavy metal concentrations. Based on multidimensional scaling ordination, the macroinvertebrate community at heavy metal pollution sites was remarkably different from that at the other sites. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed high concentrations of aluminum and iron in surface water at the polluted sites. Macroinvertebrate community structure at the metal pollution sites was significantly different from that at other sites in the same stream and in neutral-pH streams.

8,8,"He, L",Mar 2012 ,"Application of Loosely Coupled Watershed Model and Channel Model in Yellow River, China",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS,"Insufficient flow and excessive sediment supply in the Middle Yellow River lead to persistent sedimentation and rising flood levels in the lower river channel. Better understanding of the relationship between sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition can help in the decision making of soil and water conservation in the Coarse Sediment Source Area (CSSA) and sediment reduction works in the lower channel. A linked simulation can help elucidate the interrelationship. The goal of the current research is to simulate the whole sediment process from the CSSA to the downstream channels of the Yellow River. To achieve this goal, we use the Digital Yellow River Model (DYRM), a watershed hydrology and sediment yield and transportation model plate, coupled with a one-dimensional (1D) unsteady model for the hyper-concentrated sediment-laden flow in complex sections, to study the sedimentation process in the entire watershed. The performance of the simulation of flood in year 1977 was evaluated using the percent bias, Nash-Sutcliffe statistics of the residuals, and percentage difference. Simulation of the sediment process in 1977 shows that linked simulation can describe the hydrographs of discharge and sediment concentrations, especially flood in the downstream main channels. Compared with the underestimated discharge and sediment load in the main channel, the discharge of most tributaries is overestimated, whereas most of the sediment load is underestimated. The inconsistency indicates that more efforts are required to conduct better simulation, including data input and data processing, and both DYRM and 1D models.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000302846300004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DApplication%2Bof%2BLoosely%2BCoupled%2BWatershed%2BModel%2Band%2BChannel%2BModel%2Bin%2BYellow%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DL.%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DHe%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3808%252Fjei.201200206%26rft.epage%3D37%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1726-2135%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BINFORMATICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D30-37%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D30%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BINFORM%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DHe%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+INFORMATICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3808/jei.201200206,"linked simulation,Digital Yellow River Model,one-dimensional unsteady model,Yellow River",FLOW,,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Natl Resources Res, Pek 100101, Peoples R China"

Compared to AO-MBR, A-MBR and AP-MBR were both efficient in COD and NH4+-N removal, had significantly higher nitrogen removal, reduced sludge production by 35.0% and 45.9%, but deteriorated biological phosphorus removal. Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospira were major bacteria responsible for ammonium and nitrite oxidation in the three systems. Inserting ASSR and packing carriers both favored denitrifying bacteria enrichment and organic substances release, and thus resulted in higher nitrate uptake rate (NUR) in the anoxic tank. Higher endogenous NUR in ASSR than in anoxic tank also indicated that ASSR and carriers both accelerated sludge decay.

10,10,"Salomao, GN",Jul 2020 ,"Geochemical mapping in stream sediments of the Carajas Mineral Province: Background values for the Itacaiunas River watershed, Brazil",APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"Multi-elemental analysis of high-density (regional-scale) geochemical surveys is an important strategy for multipurpose applications, particularly in addressing geochemical background concentrations in different sampling media. This approach was applied to the Itacaiunas River Watershed (IRW), which is situated in the most prominent mining area of Brazil, the Carajas Mineral Province. Microcatchment-based mapping (similar to 50 km(2) each) covering the whole extent of IRW was delimited using remote sensing techniques and targeted for sampling. A total of 788 samples, including 27 duplicates, were collected in 2017. The <0.177 mm fraction of all samples was digested by aqua regia and 51 elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Geochemical maps for Fe and potentially toxic elements (PTE; As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sn, V, and Zn) and microcatchment-based distribution maps based on threshold values were constructed for the whole IRW. The stream sediment geochemistry is mainly controlled by the local geologic setting and underlying lithology. Geochemical background (GB) values for 43 elements in stream sediments of the IRW were determined by a variety of methods (Tukey's inner fences - TIF, median +/- 2*median absolute deviation - MAD, and percentile-based techniques). The results provided from the different methods show a wide range of values, with the MAD method being considered the most appropriate for deriving GB concentrations. A comparison of reference levels for PTE contemplated in the Brazilian regulation in stream sediments, the threshold concentrations obtained for the IRW area, and different study cases around the world is presented in detail. Our findings provide not only valuable information for selecting potential areas for mineral exploration surveys, but also for evaluating geochemical contaminant effects with time-varying treatments. Studies conducted to determine background values at regional scale are needed for environmental decision making, as well as to attest actions in cases of potential contamination. In the absence of these studies, misleading interpretations of the magnitude of contamination levels in a certain area may cause under- or overestimation of ecological and/or human-health risks of PTE.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000544889100011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B104608%26rft.atitle%3DGeochemical%2Bmapping%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bsediments%2Bof%2Bthe%2BCarajas%2BMineral%2BProvince%253A%2BBackground%2Bvalues%2Bfor%2Bthe%2BItacaiunas%2BRiver%2Bwatershed%252C%2BBrazil%26rft.aufirst%3DGabriel%2BNegreiros%26rft.auinit%3DGN%26rft.aulast%3DSalomao%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.apgeochem.2020.104608%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9134%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0883-2927%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BGEOCHEM%26rft.volume%3D118%26rft.au%3DSalomao%252C%2BGN%26rft.au%3DDall%2527Agnol%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3Dde%2BSiqueira%252C%2BJO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+GEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.104608,"Multi-element analysis,Stream sediments,Microcatchment-based geochemical mapping,Iron,Potentially toxic elements,Southeastern amazon","POTENTIALLY TOXIC ELEMENTS,U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY,AMAZONIAN CRATON,HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION,QUALITY GUIDELINES,BASE-LINE,DEPOSIT,AREA,MAGMATISM,THRESHOLD",,"Univ Fed Para, Inst Geociencias, Programa Posgrad Geol & Geoquim, Rua Augusto Correa 1, BR-66075110 Belem, Para, Brazil"
11,11,"Wohl, E",Jan 2014 ,"CONTROLS ON THE LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION OF CHANNEL-SPANNING LOGJAMS IN THE COLORADO FRONT RANGE, USA",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Channel-spanning logjams completely span the active channel and create longitudinal discontinuities of the water surface and stream bed across at least two-thirds of the channel width. These jams disproportionately affect channel process and form relative to smaller jams that do not span the entire channel width. We analyze a spatially extensive dataset of 859 channel-spanning jams distributed along 124km of 16 distinct rivers on the eastern side of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA, with drainage areas spanning 2.6 to 258km(2) and diverse valley geometry and forest stand age. We categorized valley geometry in terms of lateral confinement (confined, partly confined, or unconfined), which correlates with gradient. Jams exhibit substantial downstream variability in spacing at channel lengths of 10(2)-10(3)m. The number of jams within a reach is explained by a statistical model that includes drainage area, valley type (lateral confinement), and channel width. Longitudinal spacing of jams drops substantially at drainage areas greater than similar to 20km(2), although jam spacing exhibits tremendous variability at smaller drainage areas. We interpret the lack of jams at larger drainage areas to reflect increasing transport capacity for instream wood. We interpret the variability in jam spacing at small drainage areas to reflect local controls of valley geometry and associated wood recruitment and fluvial transport capacity. Our results suggest that management of instream wood designed to facilitate the formation of channel-spanning jams can be most effectively focused on smaller drainage areas where these jams are most abundant in the absence of management that alters instream wood recruitment or retention. Unmanaged streams in the study region with drainage area <60km(2) have similar to 1.1 channel-spanning jams per 100m length of stream. The cumulative effects of these jams on instream storage of sediment and organic matter, hyporheic exchange, instream habitat, stream metabolism, and channel-floodplain connectivity are likely to be enormous.

This study proposes integrating streaming media technology into the EMR system to facilitate referrals, contracted laboratories, and disease notification among hospitals. The current study encoded static and dynamic medical images of patients into a streaming video format and stored them in a Flash Media Server (FMS). Based on the Taiwan Electronic Medical Record Template (TMT) standard, EMR records can be converted into XML documents and used to integrate description fields with embedded streaming videos. This investigation implemented a web-based portable EMR interchanging system using streaming media techniques to expedite exchanging medical image information among hospitals. The proposed architecture of the portable EMR retrieval system not only provides local hospital users the ability to acquire EMR text files from a previous hospital, but also helps access static and dynamic medical images as reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The proposed method protects property rights of medical images through information security mechanisms of the Medical Record Interchange Service Center and Health Certificate Authorization to facilitate proper, efficient, and continuous treatment of patients.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000303823600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DArchitecture%2Bof%2BPortable%2BElectronic%2BMedical%2BRecords%2BSystem%2BIntegrated%2Bwith%2BStreaming%2BMedia%26rft.aufirst%3DWei%26rft.auinit%3DW%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10916-010-9442-y%26rft.epage%3D31%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0148-5598%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMEDICAL%2BSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D25-31%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D25%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BMED%2BSYST%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DShih%252C%2BCC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+MEDICAL+SYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10916-010-9442-y,"Portable EMR,Streaming media,XML,Medical records exchange",PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS,,"Tamkang Univ, Dept Informat & Commun, Tamsui 251, Taiwan"
13,13,"Vizuete-Jaramillo, E",May 2022 ,Using ion-exchange resins to monitor nitrate fluxes in remote semiarid stream beds,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Monitoring in remote areas can represent a real challenge in environmental studies. Numerous techniques have been developed over the last decades to monitor nutrients and other elements in different systems. However, not all of them are suitable for field applications, particularly when the locations are difficult to access or its accessibility depends on seasonal climate conditions. This study was aimed to test the applicability and efficiency of resin samplers and resin bags to monitor nitrates fluxes (NO3-N) in two small semi-arid catchments in Northwestern Mexico. Resin samplers were installed in the hyporheic zone below the river bed in order to monitor the vertical fluxes of NO3-N and remained there for 5 months (during the summer rains). Resin bags were anchored in rock outcrops upstream of the resin samplers before the onset of the summer rainfall season and replaced every 2 weeks during 4 months to capture pulses of NO3-N in ephemeral streams. NO3-N pulses in the stream are a potential source of NO3-N that can infiltrate into the soil. Results of the resin samplers found a difference of up to 12 kg ha(-1) season(-1) between the two catchments. The resin bags showed a higher accumulation of NO3-N in the catchment with lower vegetation cover (160.3 mg L-1 season(-1)) compared to the one with higher vegetation (67.8 mg L-1 season(-1)). Measured nitrate fluxes at both sites responded to rainfall pulses recorded during the monitoring period. Resin samplers and resin bags can be used together, to assess nutrient fluxes on the surface and in the soil and can be tested in any type of ecosystem. In this particular case, these methods demonstrated an efficient way of determining spatio-temporal nitrate fluxes in semi-arid ecosystems in remote areas that are difficult to access, monitor, and collect data.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000783510200002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B376%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2Bion-exchange%2Bresins%2Bto%2Bmonitor%2Bnitrate%2Bfluxes%2Bin%2Bremote%2Bsemiarid%2Bstream%2Bbeds%26rft.aufirst%3DEfrain%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DVizuete-Jaramillo%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10661-022-10041-8%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2959%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0167-6369%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMONITORING%2BAND%2BASSESSMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMONIT%2BASSESS%26rft.volume%3D194%26rft.au%3DVizuete-Jaramillo%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DGrahmann%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DRobles-Morua%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MONITORING+AND+ASSESSMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10661-022-10041-8,"Remote field measurements,Resin samplers,Resin bags,Catchment,Nutrient fluxes,Tropical dry forest","NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY,NET NITROGEN,SANDY SOIL,FOREST,CARBON,WATER,DYNAMICS,MINERALIZATION,DECOMPOSITION,ECOSYSTEMS",,"Inst Tecnol Sonora ITSON, Dept Ciencias Agua & Medio Ambiente, Obregon, Mexico"

Based on their significance, the sampling locations were selected. There are five sampling locations were selected like river Noyyal at sorce (S-1), Perur Lake, (S-2), Ukkadam Pond (S-3), Singanallur Lake (S-4) and Sulur Pond (S-5), and samples were collected from each locations at river Noyyal basin in and around Coimbatore district. The surface water quality index determination is prerequisite and essential. In this present work, from different methods of water quality determination, the most commonly used index of National Sanitation Foundation water quality index (NSF-WQI) has been followed.The physico-chemical and biological parameters such as dissolved oxygen, faecal coliforms counts, pH, biochemical oxygen demand, phosphate, nitrates, turbidity, and total dissolved solids were investigated. Except in Noyyal river at source (S-1) all the measured parameters are showed to be very high pollution compared to limits suggested by WHO particularly during summer season and thereby it is not suitable for public use.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000510043900028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInvestigation%2Bof%2BWater%2BQuality%2BIndex%2Bof%2BRiver%2BNoyyal%2Band%2BIts%2BConnected%2BPonds%2BCoimbatore%2BTamilnadu%2BIndia%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DJeyaraj%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.13005%252Fojc%252F350328%26rft.eissn%3D2231-5039%26rft.epage%3D1131%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0970-020X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DORIENTAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1125-1131%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1125%26rft.stitle%3DORIENT%2BJ%2BCHEM%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DJeyaraj%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DIndhuleka%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DArunpaul%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=ORIENTAL+JOURNAL+OF+CHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.13005/ojc/350328,"Physico-chemical characteristics,WQI,River Noyyal in Coimbatore district,Anthropogenic activities","POLLUTION,LAKE",,"Sri Krishna Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Chem, Coimbatore 641008, Tamil Nadu, India"
15,15,"Drincic, A",Oct 1 2018 ,Determination of hexavalent Cr in river sediments by speciated isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"During a sampling campaign in September 2015, elevated chromium (Cr) concentrations were observed in sediments of industrially exposed sites of the Sava River (stainless steel production and impact of metallurgic industry). To verify if sediments also contained hazardous hexavalent Cr (Cr(VI)), there was a need to develop a sensitive and reliable analytical procedure for its determination. In the determination of Cr(VI) in environmental samples, it is necessary to evaluate the suitability of the applied analytical methodology for each individual sample matrix. In these studies, the use of isotopically enriched Cr tracers importantly contribute to the validity of the obtained results. In the present work, an analytical procedure was optimised for the extraction of total Cr(VI) from sediments and the content of Cr(VI) determined by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). To leach the total amount of Cr(VI) from sediments, an ultrasound-assisted extraction procedure was applied at 80 degrees C, using 2% NaOH + 3% Na2CO3 as the extraction solution. The addition of 0.4 mol L-1 MgCl2 prevented oxidation of Cr(III) during the extraction step. To control for species interconversion and for an accurate calculation of Cr(VI) concentration by speciated isotope dilution (ID)-ICP-MS, the alkaline extract was doubly spiked with enriched Cr-50(VI) and Cr-53(III). The accuracy of the determination of Cr(VI) was verified by analysing the certified referencematerial CRM041 (Cr(VI) in soil), and by spike recovery test. Low limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) (1.25 and 4.0 ae g Cr(VI) kg(-1), respectively) and good repeatability of measurement (relative standard deviation better than +/- 4.8%) were obtained. The analytical data revealed that Cr(VI) concentrations in sediments of the Sava River did not represent any known environmental hazard. (C) 2018 The Authors.

16,16,"Ihara, M",Jul 2020 ,Wastewater-derived antagonistic activities of G protein-coupled receptor-acting pharmaceuticals in river water,JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY,"Pharmaceuticals are widely detected in aquatic environments, and their potential risks to aquatic species are of concern because they are designed to be biologically active. Here, we used an in vitro assay, called the transforming growth factor alpha shedding assay, to measure the biological activities of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-acting pharmaceuticals present in river water and effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Japan from 2014 to 2016. Antagonistic activities against angiotensin (AT1), dopamine (D2), adrenergic (beta 1), acetylcholine (M1) and histamine (H1) receptors were detected in river water, and were stronger downstream than upstream owing to effluent from WWTPs along the river. Ozonation at one WWTP reduced these activities. Concentrations of sulpiride (D2 antagonist) could explain 73% of antagonistic activities against the D2 receptor; those of metoprolol, atenolol and propranolol (beta 1 antagonists) could explain 16% of activities against the beta 1 receptor; and those of pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) could explain 15% of activities against the M1 receptor. Therefore, other receptor antagonists also occur. GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals should be given more attention in environmental monitoring and toxicity testing.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000514369600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWastewater-derived%2Bantagonistic%2Bactivities%2Bof%2BG%2Bprotein-coupled%2Breceptor-acting%2Bpharmaceuticals%2Bin%2Briver%2Bwater%26rft.aufirst%3DMasaru%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DIhara%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fjat.3952%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1263%26rft.epage%3D917%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0260-437X%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BAPPLIED%2BTOXICOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D908-917%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D908%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAPPL%2BTOXICOL%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DIhara%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DHanamoto%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DTanaka%252C%2BH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+APPLIED+TOXICOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/jat.3952,"GPCR-acting pharmaceuticals,ozonation,river water,TGF alpha shedding assay,WWTP effluent","PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS,ENVIRONMENTAL RISK,IN-VITRO,BEHAVIOR,REMOVAL,ASSAY",,"Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Res Ctr Environm Qual Management, Otsu, Shiga 5200811, Japan"
17,17,"Gooseff, MN",Aug 30 2005 ,"A stream tracer technique employing ionic tracers and specific conductance data applied to the Maimai catchment, New Zealand",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The stream tracer technique and transient storage models (TSMs) have become common tools in stream solute and hyporheic exchange studies. The expense and logistics associated with water sample collection and analysis often results in limited temporal resolution of stream tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs). Samples are often collected without a priori or real-time knowledge of BTC information, which can result in poor sample coverage of the critical shoulder (initial rise) and tail (post-steady state fall) of the BTC. We illustrate the use of specific conductance (SC) measurements as a surrogate for conservative dissolved tracer (Br-) samples. The advantages of collecting SC data for use in the TSM are (1) cost, (2) ease of data collection, and (3) well-defined breakthrough curves, which strengthen TSM parameter optimization. This method is based on developing an ion concentration (IC)-SC relationship from limited discrete tracer solute samples. SC data can be collected on a more frequent basis at no additional analysis cost. TSM simulations can then be run for the conservative tracer data derived from SC breakthrough curves and the IC-SC relationship. This technique was tested in a 120 m reach of stream (2-60 m subreaches) in the Maimai M15 catchment, New Zealand during baseflow recession. Dissolved LiBr was injected for 12-92 h, with Br- as the conservative ion of interest. Four TSM simulations using the OTIS model are optimized using UCODE to fit (1) Br- data derived from the Br--SC relationship (n = 1307 observations at each of two stream sampling sites), (2) all stream Br- data collected (n = 58 in upper reach, n = 60 in lower reach), (3) half of the stream Br- data collected, and (4) 20 stream Br- samples from each site. No two simulations resulted in the same optimal parameter values. Results suggest that the greater the frequency of observations, the greater the confidence in estimated parameter values. Br- -SC simulations resulted in the best overall model fits to the data, with the lowest calculated error variance of 6-37, narrowest 95% parameter estimate confidence intervals, and the highest correlation coefficient of 0-99 942, among the four simulations. This is largely due to the improved representation of the shoulder and tail of the BTC with this method. The IC-SC correlation method is robust in situations in which (1) changes in background SC data can be accounted for, and (2) the data used to define the IC-SC relationship are representative of the range of data collected. This method provides more efficient sample analysis, improved data resolution, and improved model results compared to the alternative stream tracer data gathering methods presented. Additionally, we describe a new parameterization of the cross-sectional area of the stream during flow recession, as a function of discharge, based on a stream hydraulic geometry relationship. This variant of the OTIS model provides a more realistic representation of stream dynamics during unsteady discharge.

These actions vary among climates characterized by Budyko theory, yet have not been integrated with Horton scaling, the ubiquitous pattern of eco-hydrological variation among Strahler streams that populate river basins. From Budyko theory, we reveal optimum entropy coincident with high biodiversity. Basins on either side of optimum respond in opposite ways to precipitation, which we evaluated for the classic Hubbard Brook experiment in New Hampshire and for the Whitewater River basin in Kansas. We demonstrate that Horton ratios are equivalent to Lagrange multipliers used in the extremum function leading to Shannon information entropy being maximal, subject to constraints. Properties of stream networks vary with constraints and inter-annual variation in water balance that challenge vegetation to match expected resource supply throughout the network. The entropy-Horton framework informs questions of biodiversity, resilience to perturbations in water supply, changes in potential evapotranspiration, and land use changes that move ecosystems away from optimal entropy with concomitant loss of productivity and biodiversity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000404454500012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B249%26rft.atitle%3DHorton%2BRatios%2BLink%2BSelf-Similarity%2Bwith%2BMaximum%2BEntropy%2Bof%2BEco-Geomorphological%2BProperties%2Bin%2BStream%2BNetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DBruce%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DBT%26rft.aulast%3DMilne%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fe19060249%26rft.eissn%3D1099-4300%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENTROPY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENTROPY-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DMilne%252C%2BBT%26rft.au%3DGupta%252C%2BVK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=ENTROPY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/e19060249,"Budyko,coupled eco-hydrology,Horton law,networks,scaling,Strahler streams,vegetation","INFORMATION-THEORY,WATER,VEGETATION,FOREST,RIVER,THERMODYNAMICS,EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,PATTERNS,LAWS,COEXISTENCE",,"1 Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, MSC03-2020, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA"
19,19,"Green, MD",Aug 2022 ,Rethinking biodiversity patterns and processes in stream ecosystems,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"A major goal of community ecology is understanding the processes responsible for generating biodiversity patterns along spatial and environmental gradients. In stream ecosystems, system-specific conceptual frameworks have dominated research describing biodiversity change along longitudinal gradients of river networks. However, support for these conceptual frameworks has been mixed, mainly applicable to specific stream ecosystems and biomes, and these frameworks have placed less emphasis on general mechanisms driving biodiversity patterns. Rethinking biodiversity patterns and processes in stream ecosystems with a focus on the overarching mechanisms common across ecosystems will provide a more holistic understanding of why biodiversity patterns vary along river networks. In this study, we apply the theory of ecological communities (TEC) conceptual framework to stream ecosystems to focus explicitly on the core ecological processes structuring communities: dispersal, speciation, niche selection, and ecological drift. Using a unique case study from high-elevation networks of connected lakes and streams, we sampled stream invertebrate communities in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA to test established stream ecology frameworks and compared them with the TEC framework. Local diversity increased and beta-diversity decreased moving downstream from the headwaters, consistent with the river continuum concept and the small but mighty framework of mountain stream biodiversity. Local diversity was also structured by distance below upstream lakes, where diversity increased with distance below upstream lakes, in support of the serial discontinuity concept. Despite some support for the biodiversity patterns predicted from the stream ecology frameworks, no single framework was fully supported, suggesting ""context dependence."" By framing our results under the TEC, we found that species diversity was structured by niche selection, where local diversity was highest in environmentally favorable sites. Local diversity was also highest in sites with small community sizes, countering the predicted effects of ecological drift. Moreover, higher beta-diversity in the headwaters was influenced by dispersal and niche selection, where environmentally harsh and spatially isolated sites exhibit higher community variation. Taken together our results suggest that combining system-specific ecological frameworks with the TEC provides a powerful approach for inferring the mechanisms driving biodiversity patterns and provides a path toward generalization of biodiversity research across ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000794048100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be1520%26rft.atitle%3DRethinking%2Bbiodiversity%2Bpatterns%2Band%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Bstream%2Becosystems%26rft.aufirst%3DMatthew%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DMD%26rft.aulast%3DGreen%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fecm.1520%26rft.eissn%3D1557-7015%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-9615%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BMONOGRAPHS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BMONOGR%26rft.volume%3D92%26rft.au%3DGreen%252C%2BMD%26rft.au%3DAnderson%252C%2BKE%26rft.au%3DSpasojevic%252C%2BMJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+MONOGRAPHS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/ecm.1520,"community assembly,diversity,macroinvertebrate,spatial,stream ecology,theory of ecological communities","SPECIES-DIVERSITY,BETA DIVERSITY,MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,LONGITUDINAL TRENDS,LANDSCAPE POSITION,REGIONAL RICHNESS,LAKE OUTLETS,DISPERSAL,SIMULIIDAE",,"Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Riverside, CA 92521 USA"

Quantitative evaluation of a drainage basin further helps in the micro-level study of its physiographic characteristics. In this study, an attempt has been made to determine the detailed aspects of morphometric characteristics of the Madhyamaheshwar River basin, a watershed of the Mandakini River that constitutes a part of the Alaknanda River. There are a large number of drainage systems which have their source in the Himalaya. This study was performed using the hydrology tool in geographic information system (GIS) environment. Evaluation of linear, aerial, and relief morphometric parameters was achieved through digital delineation and drainage analysis to provide hydrological insights. A detailed morphometric analysis obtained in this study enlightens distinctive morphometric settings of stream within the drainage system like stream behaviour, the interrelation between connected streams, system's inputs and outputs of matter, and energy. The geometric structure of the basin is ideal for flood velocity assessment backing significantly to stream energy and erosive patterns. Such geometric forms are ideal for increasing flood velocities, which contribute greatly to the available stream energy, and erosion and transportation capacities. Features such as hydrogeology have been evaluated to anticipate the drainage characteristics of the river.

The green and blue components of the WF were evaluated by performing a soil-water balance at a 10-day time-interval. The surface runoff was calibrated based on continuous streamflow measurements. Meanwhile, the grey component of the WF related to nitrogen use was quantified by means of the results from the in-stream monitoring activities.The methodology can be applied to any catchment where soil, land use, weather, agricultural practices, nitrogen balance and stream data are available.

The bedrock is mostly comprised of limestone, and is generally resistive compared to the overlying soil. The soil-bedrock interface was determined through a trial and error approach using a sharp boundary feature in the inversion model. The inferred bedrock surface determined from the inversions exhibited undulating patterns with troughs and ridges. A near continuous trough ran alongside the stream within the floodplain, and is suggestive of a paleochannel among other interpretations of this feature. The structure of the electrical resistivity above the bedrock showed small-scale elongated features. The chargeability from the IP method showed larger scale features. High values of chargeability were associated with the sediments in the floodplain, and low values were associated with bedrock, stream, and soil on the elevated banks above the stream. If the chargeability is associated with membrane polarization characteristic of clayey soils, then IP seems to highlight the mere existence of clay, while the resistivity may be more discernable of the relative proportion of clay. Vegetation differences may also explain the chargeability distribution, where parts of the survey with high chargeability had dense pine with no understory making the soils more organically rich.

24,24,"Morel-Seytoux, HJ",Feb 2016 ,Impact of aquifer desaturation on steady-state river seepage,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Flow exchange between surface and ground water is of great importance be it for beneficial allocation and use of the water resources or for the proper exercise of water rights. That exchange can take place under a saturated or unsaturated flow regime. Which regimes occur depend on conditions in the vicinity of the interactive area. Withdrawals partially sustained by seepage may not bring about desaturation but greater amounts eventually will. The problem considered in this paper deals only with the steady-state case. It is meant as a first step toward a simple, yet accurate and physically based treatment of the transient situation. The primary purpose of the article is to provide simple criteria for determination of the initiation of desaturation in an aquifer originally in saturated hydraulic connection with a river or a recharge area. The extent of the unsaturated zone in the aquifer will increase with increasing withdrawals while at the same time the seepage rate from the river increases. However the seepage increase will stop once infiltration takes place strictly by gravity in the aquifer and is no longer opposed by the capillary rise from the water table below the riverbed. Following desaturation simple criteria are derived and simple analytical formulae provided to estimate the river seepage based on the position of the water table mound below the clogging layer and at some distance away from the river bank. They fully account for the unsaturated flow phenomena, including the existence of a drainage entry pressure. Two secondary objectives were to verify that (1) the assumption of uniform vertical flow through a clogging layer and that (2) the approximation of the water table mound below the seepage area as a flat surface were both reasonably legitimate. This approach will be especially advantageous for the implementation of the methodology in large-scale applications of integrated hydrologic models used for management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

25,25,"Tippler, C",2014 ,The influence of concrete on the geochemical qualities of urban streams,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"The geochemical signature of freshwater streams can be used to determine the extent and nature of modification to stream water geochemistry due to urban development. This approach used the Gibbs (1970) diagram as a model for evaluation of changes to ionic composition linked to urban development. In this multi-year study, the geochemistry of 21 waterways in the Georges River catchment, Sydney, were monitored and compared with the level of urban development as measured by sub-catchment imperviousness and directly connected imperviousness. The results reflect a strong relationship between the intensity of sub-catchment urban development and stream geochemistry. All major geochemical attributes increased with escalating levels of urban development. The largest increase was for bicarbonate, which increased 18 times from a mean of 6.4 mg L-1 at non-urban streams to a mean of 118 mg L-1 at urban streams. Similarly, mean concentrations of calcium increased by 14 times (from 2 to 27.9 mg L-1). Mean salinity was enriched in the most urban streams, compared with non-urban streams, by more than 6 times. We attribute this, in part, to the influence of urban geology, notably concrete stormwater infrastructure. Changes in stream geochemistry due to urban development are an important element of the urban stream syndrome.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000344381700007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bconcrete%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bgeochemical%2Bqualities%2Bof%2Burban%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DCarl%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DTippler%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FMF13164%26rft.eissn%3D1448-6059%26rft.epage%3D1017%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1323-1650%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1009-1017%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1009%26rft.stitle%3DMAR%2BFRESHWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D65%26rft.au%3DTippler%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DWright%252C%2BIA%26rft.au%3DHanlon%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1071/MF13164,"geochemistry,Gibbs diagram,impervious surface,ionic pollution,urbanisation,urban stream syndrome","RAINWATER COMPOSITION,IMPERVIOUS SURFACE,WATER,RIVER,URBANIZATION,AUSTRALIA,TOXICITY,CONDUCTIVITY,IMPACT",,"Univ Western Sydney, Sch Sci & Hlth, Locked Bag 1791, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia"
26,26,"Hein, CL",May 2011 ,Effects of coupled natural and anthropogenic factors on the community structure of diadromous fish and shrimp species in tropical island streams,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"P>1. Overlapping river and road networks provide a framework for studying the complex interactions between natural and human systems, with river-road intersections as focal areas of study. Roads can alter the morphology of stream channels, pose barriers to freshwater fauna, provide easy access to streams for humans and non-native species and accelerate the expansion of urban development.2. We determined what variables control the structure of diadromous fish and shrimp communities and assessed whether particular road crossings altered community structure in north-eastern Puerto Rico. We identified 24 sites that represented a range of river and road sizes across two catchments that drain El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico.3. The location of natural barriers and the size of stream pools were the most important variables for predicting six of fifteen fish and shrimp distributions. Predatory fishes were predicted to be limited to areas in the river network below large, steep waterfalls, whereas adult shrimp Atya lanipes (Atyidae) were predicted to be present above these waterfalls. The fish Awaous banana was predicted to be present in pools > 11.6 m wide, whereas the shrimp Xiphocaris elongata was predicted to be present in pools < 10.4 m wide. The distributions of nine species were predicted poorly, but three of these species were common and three were rare.4. Although urban and agricultural land covers were among the top three predictors of five species distributions, they were probably good predictors because they were correlated with the natural gradient. Further study is necessary to disentangle natural and anthropogenic gradients.5. Road crossings, 10 of which were culverts, were not dispersal barriers for fishes or shrimps. On average, species were present both upstream and downstream from road crossings at 68% of sites where they occurred. Absences upstream or downstream from road crossings occurred at 16% of sites each and likely resulted from a failure to detect species.6. Several existing features of these catchments and taxa may aid in fish and shrimp conservation. The headwaters are protected by management practices of El Yunque National Forest, connectivity within the river network has been maintained, and the diadromous life history of these organisms makes them resilient to pulsed disturbances.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000289171400017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bcoupled%2Bnatural%2Band%2Banthropogenic%2Bfactors%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bcommunity%2Bstructure%2Bof%2Bdiadromous%2Bfish%2Band%2Bshrimp%2Bspecies%2Bin%2Btropical%2Bisland%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DCatherine%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DCL%26rft.aulast%3DHein%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2010.02537.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1015%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1002-1015%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1002%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DHein%252C%2BCL%26rft.au%3DPike%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DCrowl%252C%2BTA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02537.x,"diadromous,distribution models,random forests,roads,tropical stream","FRESH-WATER SHRIMP,NERITINA-VIRGINEA GASTROPODA,UPSTREAM MIGRATION,PUERTO-RICO,POPULATION-STRUCTURE,URBANIZATION,PATTERNS,MODELS,CLASSIFICATION,BIOCOMPLEXITY",,"Abisko Sci Res Stn, Climate Impacts Res Ctr, SE-98107 Abisko, Sweden"

The key idea behind this approach is to identify representative topics in incoming documents and align them with the existing representative topics that they immediately follow (in time). To this end, we learn a set of streaming tree cuts from topic trees based on user-selected focus nodes. A dynamic Bayesian network model has been developed to derive the tree cuts in the incoming topic trees to balance the fitness of each tree cut and the smoothness between adjacent tree cuts. By connecting the corresponding topics at different times, we are able to provide an overview of the evolving hierarchical topics. A sedimentation-based visualization has been designed to enable the interactive analysis of streaming text data from global patterns to local details.

28,28,"Korus, JT",Jul 1 2020 ,"Transient streambed hydraulic conductivity in channel and bar environments, Loup River, Nebraska",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) and vertical K (K- v) are key controls on groundwater and surface water exchange and biogeochemical fluxes through the hyporheic zone, but drivers of transient hydraulic properties in different fluvial environments are poorly understood. This study combines hydrogeology, geophysics, and sedimentology to reveal mechanisms of K and K- v transience in the upper 0.5 m of a sandy streambed during low discharge. Hydraulic tests (44 slug tests, 130 falling-head permeameter tests) and 130 grain-size analyses were repeated three times over 8 weeks on a 1,200 m(2) grid spanning: (a) a channel with continuously flowing water and mobile bed load; (b) an adjacent mid-channel bar that was stationary and infrequently submerged. Aerial photographs and ground-penetrating radar show scour and complete reworking of fluvial sediments in the channel. Bar sediments below the water table remained immobile, but infrequent flows of moderate discharge reworked the uppermost few centimetres of the bar top. Despite differences in sediment mobility and stream flow characteristics across environments, K and K- v exhibited order-of-magnitude differences in spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in both the channel and bar. Mean K and K- v values in the channel were comparatively stable over time. In the immobile bar, mean K declined 20% and K- v declined 26% after increased discharge temporarily inundated the bar. Grain-size distributions were steady across both environments over time, but repeat geophysical surveys of the bar show a decrease in electrical conductivity, likely from porosity reduction. These findings suggest that sediment dynamics and stream flow characteristics in different streambed environments are important drivers of K transience during low discharge conditions. Specifically, pore clogging can be an important mechanism of transience over short durations (weeks to months) in immobile sediments subject to infrequent flows and minor reworking.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000534577400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTransient%2Bstreambed%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bin%2Bchannel%2Band%2Bbar%2Benvironments%252C%2BLoup%2BRiver%252C%2BNebraska%26rft.aufirst%3DJesse%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DJT%26rft.aulast%3DKorus%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13777%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D3077%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D14%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3061-3077%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3061%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DKorus%252C%2BJT%26rft.au%3DFraundorfer%252C%2BWP%26rft.au%3DKarnik%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.13777,"fluvial sediments,geophysics,groundwater,heterogeneity,hydraulic tests,hyporheic zone,porosity,temporal variability","SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,HYPORHEIC ZONE,HETEROGENEITY,FLOW,HYDROGEOLOGY,DEPOSITS,IMPACTS,SYSTEM,CREEK",,"Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Sch Nat Resources, Conservat & Survey Div, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA"
29,29,"Zhang, PP",May 24 2022 ,The Impact of the Three Gorges Reservoir on Water Exchange Between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) operation has profoundly altered the hydrological regimes and ecosystem in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin. Its impacts on the river flow regime, sedimentation, lake level decline, and biodiversity have been extensively studied. However, the quantitative influence of the TGR on the downstream water exchange between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake is lacking attention. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to investigate the river-lake water exchange variations under the TGR operation in typical hydrological years, compared with the natural scenario (i.e., no TGR). The results show that the machine learning model could provide a fast and accurate approach to identify the long-distance impact of reservoirs. The operation of the TGR has significant effects on the water exchange between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake in the impounding period, with a 10,000 m(3)/s decrease in reservoir discharge approximately causing a 4,000 m(3)/s decrease in river-lake water exchange in the dry year and a decrease of 6,000 m(3)/s and 8,000 m(3)/s in reservoir discharge causing an increase of 4,000 m(3)/s and 6,000 m(3)/s in the normal year and the wet year, respectively. The TGR effect varies with different hydrological conditions of the river and lake, showing longer time range (from May to October) and greater degree (1.5 times the change rate in other years) in the wet year. The TGR operation is beneficial to the water maintenance of the lake in the dry year and flood control in the lake area in the wet year. This study provides a constructive approach and valuable information for decision making in water resource management and ecosystem protection in large river-lake systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000820442200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B876286%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BImpact%2Bof%2Bthe%2BThree%2BGorges%2BReservoir%2Bon%2BWater%2BExchange%2BBetween%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2Band%2BPoyang%2BLake%26rft.aufirst%3DPeipei%26rft.auinit%3DPP%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffeart.2022.876286%26rft.eissn%3D2296-6463%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BEARTH%2BSC-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BPP%26rft.au%3DMao%252C%2BJQ%26rft.au%3DHu%252C%2BTF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+EARTH+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/feart.2022.876286,"Three Gorges Reservoir,operation scheme,Poyang Lake,machine learning model,water exchange","WETLAND VEGETATION,FLOW REGULATION,DAM,HYDROPOWER,BIODIVERSITY,DYNAMICS,REGIMES,MIDDLE",,"Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China"

A three-stage super-efficiency SBM model, which eliminated the influence of environmental factors and random errors, was constructed to make it possible to conduct an in-depth comparative analysis on the effective decision-making units (DMUs), making the calculation results more accurate. This was the main contribution of this paper. Based on the new model considering undesirable output, this paper analyzed the panel data of 11 provinces and cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2007 to 2017 and investigated the coordination development level from the dimensions of time and space considering the energy input and carbon emissions of the two industries. Our main research findings were as follows. First, due to the relative lagging of the logistics industry in promoting the development of the manufacturing industry, the overall level of the coordination between the two industries was at a stage of limited coordination. Second, the regional differences were significant with a spatial evolution pattern of ""high in the east and low in the west"". Third, environmental factors affected the input efficiency of the logistics industry and the manufacturing industry, especially the latter. Overall, this paper made theoretical and practical contributions to promoting the joint development of the two industries, improving the logistics industry and upgrading the manufacturing industry.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000650928500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B5167%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluation%2Bof%2Bthe%2BSustainable%2BCoupling%2BCoordination%2Bof%2Bthe%2BLogistics%2BIndustry%2Band%2Bthe%2BManufacturing%2BIndustry%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%26rft.aufirst%3DYing%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DGong%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fsu13095167%26rft.eissn%3D2071-1050%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DGong%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BXQ%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BYF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/su13095167,"logistics,manufacturing,sustainable development,coupling coordination,Yangtze River Economic Belt,three-stage super-efficiency SBM model","EFFICIENCY,TOURISM",,"Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Chongqing Engn Technol Res Ctr Informat Managemen, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China"
32,32,"Liu, XY",Sep 2021 ,Adaptive Transfer Learning Based on a Two-Stream Densely Connected Residual Shrinkage Network for Transformer Fault Diagnosis over Vibration Signals,ELECTRONICS,"Vibration signal analysis is an efficient online transformer fault diagnosis method for improving the stability and safety of power systems. Operation in harsh interference environments and the lack of fault samples are the most challenging aspects of transformer fault diagnosis. High-precision performance is difficult to achieve when using conventional fault diagnosis methods. Thus, this study proposes a transformer fault diagnosis method based on the adaptive transfer learning of a two-stream densely connected residual shrinkage network over vibration signals. First, novel time-frequency analysis methods (i.e., Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transform and Synchrosqueezed Generalized S-transform) are proposed to convert vibration signals into different images, effectively expanding the samples and extracting effective features of signals. Second, a Two-stream Densely Connected Residual Shrinkage (TSDen2NetRS) network is presented to achieve a high accuracy fault diagnosis under different working conditions. Furthermore, the Residual Shrinkage layer (RS layer) is applied as a nonlinear transformation layer to the deep learning framework to remove unimportant features and enhance anti-interference performance. Lastly, an adaptive transfer learning algorithm that can automatically select the source data set by using the domain measurement method is proposed. This algorithm accelerates the training of the deep learning network and improves accuracy when the number of samples is small. Vibration experiments of transformers are conducted under different operating conditions, and their results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000694163800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2130%26rft.atitle%3DAdaptive%2BTransfer%2BLearning%2BBased%2Bon%2Ba%2BTwo-Stream%2BDensely%2BConnected%2BResidual%2BShrinkage%2BNetwork%2Bfor%2BTransformer%2BFault%2BDiagnosis%2Bover%2BVibration%2BSignals%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaoyan%26rft.auinit%3DXY%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Felectronics10172130%26rft.eissn%3D2079-9292%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D17%26rft.jtitle%3DELECTRONICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DELECTRONICS-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DHe%252C%2BYG%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=ELECTRONICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/electronics10172130,"synchrosqueezed,two-stream,TSDen2NetRS,residual shrinkage layer,adaptive transfer learning","CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK,POWERED RFID SENSOR,CLASSIFICATION",,"Wuhan Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China"

We used a whole-stream steady state N-15-labeled nitrate ((NO3-)-N-15) and conservative tracer (Cl-) addition to investigate the spatial and temporal physiochemical conditions controlling the denitrification dynamics in the HZ of an upland agricultural stream. We measured solute concentrations ((NO3-)-N-15, N-15(2) (g), as well as NO3-, NH3, DOC, DO, Cl ), and hydraulic transport parameters (head, flow rates, flow paths, and residence time distributions) of the reach and along HZ flow paths of an instrumented gravel bar. HZ exchange was observed across the entire gravel bar (i.e., in all wells) with flow path lengths up to 4.2 m and corresponding median residence times greater than 28.5 h. The HZ transitioned from a net nitrification environment at its head (short residence times) to a net denitrification environment at its tail (long residence times). NO3- increased at short residence times from 0.32 to 0.54 mg-N L-1 until a threshold of 6.9 h and then consistently decreased from 0.54 to 0.03 mg-N L-1. Along these same flow paths, declines were seen in DO (from 8.31 to 0.59 mg-O-2 L-1) and DOC (from 3.0 to 1.7 mg-C L-1). The rates of the DO and DOC removal and net nitrification were greatest during short residence times, while the rate of denitrification was greatest at long residence times. (NO3-)-N-15 tracing confirmed that a fraction of the NO3- removal was via denitrification as N-15(2) was produced across the entire gravel bar HZ. Production of N-15(2) across all observed flow paths and residence times indicated that denitrification microsites are present even where nitrification was the net outcome. These findings demonstrate that the HZ is an active nitrogen sink in this system and that the distinction between net nitrification and denitrification in the HZ is a function of residence time and exhibits threshold behavior. Consequently, incorporation of HZ exchange and water residence time characterizations will improve mechanistic predictions of nitrogen cycling in streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000288325900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG01025%26rft.atitle%3DDynamics%2Bof%2Bnitrate%2Bproduction%2Band%2Bremoval%2Bas%2Ba%2Bfunction%2Bof%2Bresidence%2Btime%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DJay%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DZarnetske%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010JG001356%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D116%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DHaggerty%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DBaker%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2010JG001356,,"DESERT STREAM,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,ORGANIC-CARBON,NITROGEN,DENITRIFICATION,RETENTION,CHANNEL,RIVER,BIOAVAILABILITY,NITRIFICATION",,"Oregon State Univ, Dept Geosci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA"
34,34,"Chisholm, G",Jan 20 2020 ,Decoupled electrolysis using a silicotungstic acid electron-coupled-proton buffer in a proton exchange membrane cell,ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA,"The storage of renewably-generated energy as hydrogen via the electrolysis of water is a fundamental cornerstone of a sustainable hydrogen economy. Conventional electrolysers usually require stable power inputs in order to operate effectively and safely and so may be unsuited to harnessing renewable power, which is often intermittent and diffuse. Electrolysis mediated by Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffers has the potential to overcome some of the challenges surrounding electrolysis using low and/or sporadic power inputs (especially those related to gas crossover) as the use of Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffers allows the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions to be completely decoupled from one another. Herein, we show that silicotungstic acid can be used as an Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffer in a proton exchange membrane cell, decoupling the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions at steady state current densities as high as 500 mA cm(-2). O-2 and H-2 can be produced continuously by this system by cycling a fixed volume of the Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffer solution. Even at current densities as low as 25 mA cm(-2), the level of hydrogen in the oxygen stream is <0.4%, whereas a conventional proton exchange membrane electrolyser operating at this current density produces oxygen containing nearly 2% hydrogen (unacceptable for most applications). Furthermore, using silicotungstic acid as an Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffer also confers greater tolerance to non-deionised water inputs and reduces fluoride release from the perfluorosulfonated membrane (a marker for membrane degradation) relative to a conventional proton exchange membrane electrolyser. Together, these results highlight the promise and potential advantages of Electron-Coupled-Proton Buffers (and silicotungstic acid in particular) for the electrolytic production of hydrogen and oxygen over a wide range of current densities, such as might be delivered by renewable power inputs.

35,35,"Anibas, C",Jan 24 2011 ,A simple thermal mapping method for seasonal spatial patterns of groundwater-surface water interaction,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A simple thermal mapping method for simulating seasonal and spatial patterns of groundwater-surface water interaction is developed and tested for a segment of the Aa River, Belgium. Spatially distributed temperature profiles in the hyporheic zone of the river are measured in winter and summer seasons of three consecutive years. Inverse modeling of the one-dimensional heat transport equation is applied to estimate vertical advective fluxes using the numerical STRIVE model and an analytical model. Results of the study show that seasonal flux estimates for summer and winter can be derived with a minimum data input and simulation effort. The estimated fluxes are analyzed via non-parametric statistical tests, while spatial interpolation techniques are used to generate maps of distributed flux exchange. The estimated seepage is compared with volumetric flux obtained from piezometer measurements and output of a groundwater model. The thermal method shows higher discharge rates in winter and that the relative contribution of exfiltration to the river discharge is higher in summer. A higher flux and a more heterogeneous flow pattern are observed in the upper reach of the river compared to the lower reach. This spatial difference shows the importance of the local geomorphology and to a lesser extent the hydrogeologic setting on hyporheic flux exchange in the river. A significantly higher flux is noted on the banks than in the center of the river, which is driven by the relatively high hydraulic conductivity of the river banks. It is concluded that bank flow in groundwater-surface water interaction deserves more attention. The main channel of the Aa River alone accounts for about 15% of the total river discharge at its outlet.

36,36,"Li, J",Apr 2020 ,QoE-Driven Coupled Uplink and Downlink Rate Adaptation for 360-Degree Video Live Streaming,IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS,"360-degree video provides an immersive 360-degree viewing experience and has been widely used in many areas. The 360-degree video live streaming systems involve capturing, compression, uplink (camera to video server) and downlink (video server to user) transmissions. However, few studies have jointly investigated such complex systems, especially the rate adaptation for the coupled uplink and downlink in the 360-degree video streaming under limited bandwidth constraints. In this letter, we propose a quality of experience (QoE)-driven 360-degree video live streaming system, in which a video server performs rate adaptation based on the uplink and downlink bandwidths and information concerning each user's real-time field-of-view (FoV). We formulate it as a nonlinear integer programming problem and propose an algorithm, which combines the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition and branch and bound method, to solve it. The numerical results show that the proposed optimization model can improve users' QoE significantly in comparison with other baseline schemes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000528817100034,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQoE-Driven%2BCoupled%2BUplink%2Band%2BDownlink%2BRate%2BAdaptation%2Bfor%2B360-Degree%2BVideo%2BLive%2BStreaming%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FLCOMM.2020.2966193%26rft.eissn%3D1558-2558%26rft.epage%3D867%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1089-7798%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D863-867%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D863%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BCOMMUN%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DFeng%252C%2BRS%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BQY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=IEEE+COMMUNICATIONS+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/LCOMM.2020.2966193,"Virtual reality,360-degree video,video streaming,quality of experience,rate adaptation,Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition,uplink",,,"Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Hefei 23009, Peoples R China"
37,37,"Fischer, CD",May 20 2013 ,Hydrogen recovery from the purge stream of an HDA process using the concept of Mass Exchange Networks,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY,"In this paper we use the concept of Mass Exchange Networks to design the hydrogen recovery from the purge stream of an HDA Process by implementing a recently proposed counter current gas permeation equipment to exchange hydrogen between the purge and the toluene feed to the process. This design would correspond to the final design refinement step in the Douglas [1,2] hierarchical process design procedure, proposed by Fischer and Iribarren [3]. The goal of this design is recovering part of the hydrogen available in the purge stream, and results in a process alternative different from other flow sheet recently proposed by Bouton and Luyben [4], also resorting to gas permeation membrane units, but in a traditional arrangement. Two different types of available zeolite ceramic membranes were studied, of different permeability and selectivity. The here proposed mass exchange design recovers a similar amount of hydrogen as the process alternative proposed by Bouton and Luyben [4] who use a less expensive type of polymeric membrane, but need a compressor to recycle the permeate stream because they use transmembrane pressure as the driving force. The here proposed design at actual cost of zeolite membranes allows an 153.9% increase of the Net Annual Savings with respect to the pressure driven membrane system when using the less selective ceramic membrane, while this figure descents to a 32.61% when using the most selective (which is also the most expensive alternative).

38,38,"Xu, D",Feb 1 2019 ,The Spatiotemporal Coupling Characteristics of Regional Urbanization and Its Influencing Factors: Taking the Yangtze River Delta as an Example,SUSTAINABILITY,"The research on the coupling coordination of regional urbanization is of great significance for achieving sustainable urbanization. Based on the theories of coordinated development, this paper constructs an index system for comprehensive evaluation of the three sub-systems of urbanization (population, economy and land urbanization). Then, the entropy method, coupling coordination degree model and spatial autocorrelation analysis are used to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of overall and pairwise coordination among population, land and economy urbanization. Finally, the geographic detector model is used to analyze the influencing factors in the urbanization process. The results show that: (1) the levels of population, land and economy urbanization in the Yangtze River Delta have been improved from 2001 to 2016. The overall and pairwise coupling coordination degrees among them also continue to improve and the stage characteristics are presented. (2) The spatial distribution of low-level and high-level coupling coordination cities shows a certain spatial dependence and a Z-shaped pattern, respectively. The spatiotemporal characteristics of pairwise coupling coordination indicate regional imbalance of the urbanization. (3) The overall coupling coordination degree of urbanization has an apparent spatial autocorrelation, with its local spatial correlation patterns dominated by the High-High and Low-Low type agglomeration. Significant differences in local spatial correlation patterns of the pairwise coupling coordination suggest that regional synergy should not be neglected. (4) The economic development level is the main factor influencing the spatiotemporal differentiation of the coupling coordination of urbanization. Location traffic conditions and population agglomeration effect are the second most influencing factors. The evolution mechanisms of coupling coordination of urbanization are affected by factors in change. The findings highlight the importance of dealing with the relationship among population, land and economy in the process of regional urbanization and have implications for promoting the integration of urban agglomerations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000458929500267,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B822%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BSpatiotemporal%2BCoupling%2BCharacteristics%2Bof%2BRegional%2BUrbanization%2Band%2BIts%2BInfluencing%2BFactors%253A%2BTaking%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BDelta%2Bas%2Ban%2BExample%26rft.aufirst%3DDong%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DXu%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fsu11030822%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2071-1050%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DHou%252C%2BGL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/su11030822,"urbanization,coupling coordination,spatiotemporal evolution,influencing factors,the Yangtze River Delta","LAND-USE,RURAL SETTLEMENTS,CHINA,GROWTH,INDUSTRIALIZATION,POPULATION,LANDSCAPE",,"Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"

Using the improved field model, geographic concentration and elasticity coefficient, and taking the lower reaches of the Yellow River as the study area, this study defines the scope of urban economic hinterland in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in China from 2005 to 2017, further analyzes the dynamic process of urban built-up land agglomeration and economic hinterland agglomeration, and reveals the spatial-temporal coupling relationships of urban built-up land expansion and economic hinterland development. The results revealed the following: (1) From 2005 to 2017, the spatial and temporal change pattern of the economic hinterland of each city in the lower reaches of the Yellow River had basically the same trend, showing a low degree of coincidence with the administrative divisions and obvious differences in scope and change; (2) The geographic concentration of built-up land showed a trend of centering on the cities of Zhengzhou and Jinan, spreading to the periphery, and gradually forming a high-value contiguous area in both cities. The spatial distribution patterns of the geographic concentration of economic hinterland are mainly manifested in Zhengzhou and Jinan, showing a circle structure of areas with ""highest-low-higher"" concentrations of economic hinterland moving away from the urban center; (3) The spatial-temporal coupling between the expansion of urban built-up land and the development of economic hinterland underwent an obvious transformation process. From 2005 to 2011, the coupling mode was mainly growth, and, from 2011 to 2017, it began to shift to extensive and intensive development. The coupling model of urban built-up land and economic hinterland in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has a good trend.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000493525500077,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B5218%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Band%2BTemporal%2BAgglomeration%2BCharacteristics%2Band%2BCoupling%2BRelationship%2Bof%2BUrban%2BBuilt-Up%2BLand%2Band%2BEconomic%2BHinterland-A%2BCase%2BStudy%2Bof%2Bthe%2BLower%2BYellow%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DYunfeng%26rft.auinit%3DYF%26rft.aulast%3DCen%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fsu11195218%26rft.eissn%3D2071-1050%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DCen%252C%2BYF%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BPY%26rft.au%3DRong%252C%2BTQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/su11195218,"economic hinterland,built-up land,agglomeration characteristics,coupling relationship,the Lower Yellow River","GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION,UNITED-STATES,PATTERNS,SPHERES,EXPANSION,SYSTEM,TRADE,CITY",,"Henan Univ, Res Ctr Reg Dev & Planning, Key Lab Geospatial Technol Middle & Lower Yellow, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China"
41,41,"Lozier, MS",Nov 1997 ,Exchange geometry revealed by float trajectories in the Gulf Stream,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,"In an effort to understand the extent to which Lagrangian pathways in the Gulf Stream indicate fluid exchange between the stream and its surroundings, trajectories of RAFOS floats are viewed in a frame of reference moving with the dominant zonal phase speed associated with nr periodic flow. In such a frame, geometrical structures emerge that more clearly delineate the position of the parcel in relation to the jet core and its surroundings. The basic premise of this work is that the pathways of fluid parcels in the vicinity of stagnation points, as defined in the moving frame of reference, are susceptible to changes in their pathways, thereby facilitating fluid exchange between different regions of the flow field. Four representative RAFOS float trajectories are shown to exhibit the expected behavior in the vicinity of stagnation points. To further examine the mechanism of exchange in the vicinity of these geometrical features, concepts from dynamical systems theory are applied to a numerically simulated flow field. The entrainment and detrainment of parcels from the jet core are explained in the context of stable and unstable manifolds and their associated lobes. It is shown that the Lagrangian pathways from the numerical flow and the observational trajectories exhibit a similarity based on the kinematics of a meandering flow field. Overall, this study provides the first look at RAFOS float trajectories in a moving frame and provides insight as to how the temporal variability of a jet creates chaotic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1997YF28900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExchange%2Bgeometry%2Brevealed%2Bby%2Bfloat%2Btrajectories%2Bin%2Bthe%2BGulf%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DMS%26rft.auinit%3DMS%26rft.aulast%3DLozier%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1175%252F1520-0485%25281997%2529027%253C2327%253AEGRBFT%253E2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D2341%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-3670%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BPHYSICAL%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2327-2341%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2327%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BPHYS%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DLozier%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DPratt%252C%2BLJ%26rft.au%3DMiller%252C%2BPD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+PHYSICAL+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1175/1520-0485(1997)027<2327:EGRBFT>2.0.CO;2,,"MEANDERING JET,FLUID EXCHANGE,ROSSBY WAVES,PROPAGATION",,"DUKE UNIV, NICHOLAS SCH ENVIRONM, DIV EARTH & OCEAN SCI, OLD CHEM BLDG, BOX 90227, DURHAM, NC 27708 USA"

43,43,"Schade, JD",2016 ,Variation in summer nitrogen and phosphorus uptake among Siberian headwater streams,POLAR RESEARCH,"Arctic streams are likely to receive increased inputs of dissolved nutrients and organic matter from thawing permafrost as climate warms. Documenting how Arctic streams process inorganic nutrients is necessary to understand mechanisms that regulate watershed fluxes of permafrost-derived materials to downstream ecosystems. We report on summer nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake in streams draining upland soils from the Pleistocene, and lowland floodplain soils from the Holocene, in Siberia's Kolyma River watershed. Uptake of N and P differed between upland and floodplain streams, suggesting topographic variation in nutrient limitation. In floodplain streams, P uptake rate and uptake velocity were higher than N, while upland streams had similar values for all N and P uptake metrics. Phosphorus uptake velocity and size of the transient hydrologic storage zone were negatively related across all study streams, indicating strong influence of hydrologic processes on nutrient fluxes. Physical sorption of P was higher in floodplain stream sediments relative to upland stream sediments, suggesting more physically driven uptake in floodplain streams and higher biological activity in upland streams. Overall, these results demonstrate that high-latitude headwater streams actively retain N and P during summer base flows; however, floodplain and upland streams varied substantially in N and P uptake and may respond differently to inorganic nutrient and organic matter inputs. Our results highlight the need for a comprehensive assessment of N and P uptake and retention in Arctic streams in order to fully understand the impact of permafrost-derived materials on ecosystem processes, and their fate in continental drainage networks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000381040100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B24571%26rft.atitle%3DVariation%2Bin%2Bsummer%2Bnitrogen%2Band%2Bphosphorus%2Buptake%2Bamong%2BSiberian%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJohn%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DSchade%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3402%252Fpolar.v35.24571%26rft.eissn%3D1751-8369%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0800-0395%26rft.jtitle%3DPOLAR%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DPOLAR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DSchade%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DSeybold%252C%2BEC%26rft.au%3DZimov%252C%2BN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=POLAR+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3402/polar.v35.24571,"Arctic streams,nutrient uptake,hydrologic transient storage,phosphorus sorption,coupled N and P cycling","PERMAFROST CARBON,HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS,TRANSIENT STORAGE,NUTRIENT-UPTAKE,ECOSYSTEM,DYNAMICS,AMMONIUM,TUNDRA,RIVER,FERTILIZATION",,"St Olaf Coll, Dept Environm Studies, 1520 St Olaf Ave, Northfield, MN 55057 USA"

This study established an indicator system for the WEF system, and used the coupling coordination degree and decoupling model to analyze the coupling relationship of the WEF system. The multi-scale spatial equilibrium pattern was also evaluated using spatial equilibrium methods. And the results indicated that: 1) the development level of WEF in YRB increased during 2000-2019, and the coupling coordination degree developed from imminent unbalance to moderate coordination phase with a U-shaped spatial pattern; 2) the area with the optimum state of the decoupling relationship gradually expanded, and overall regional coordination significantly improved; 3) the spatial equilibrium degree increased from northwest to southeast, with the Hu Line being the dividing line and the BoleTaipei Line being the boundary of spatial equilibrium.

46,46,"Xie, YQ",Jul 2016 ,Solute transport processes in flow-event-driven stream-aquifer interaction,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The interaction between streams and groundwater controls key features of the stream hydrograph and chemograph. Since surface runoff is usually less saline than groundwater, flow events are usually accompanied by declines in stream salinity. In this paper, we use numerical modelling to show that, at any particular monitoring location: (i) the increase in stream stage associated with a flow event will precede the decrease in solute concentration (arrival time lag for solutes); and (ii) the decrease in stream stage following the flow peak will usually precede the subsequent return (increase) in solute concentration (return time lag). Both arrival time lag and return time lag increase with increasing wave duration. However, arrival time lag decreases with increasing wave amplitude, whereas return time lag increases. Furthermore, while arrival time lag is most sensitive to parameters that control river velocity (channel roughness and stream slope), return time lag is most sensitive to groundwater parameters (aquifer hydraulic conductivity, recharge rate, and dispersitivity). Additionally, the absolute magnitude of the decrease in river concentration is sensitive to both river and groundwater parameters. Our simulations also show that in-stream mixing is dominated by wave propagation and bank storage processes, and in-stream dispersion has a relatively minor effect on solute concentrations. This has important implications for spreading of contaminants released to streams. Our work also demonstrates that a high contribution of pre-event water (or groundwater) within the flow hydrograph can be caused by the combination of in-stream and bank storage exchange processes, and does not require transport of pre-event water through the catchment.

In this paper, spatial variations of delta O-18 and delta D of river water and their sources within a large region of the Tarim River were investigated. The results showed obvious spatial variations of both water isotope values along the river flow direction, and significant seasonal variation occurred within the river water isotopes. This indicated that different proportions of rain and melt water entering river water should lead to spatial variation, and for mid-stream and downstream regions, the transformation relationship between surface water and groundwater should consider less input of melt water. Furthermore, we quantitatively determine the ratio of different water sources using the stable isotope mass balance method and other stable tracer elements. Results showed the contribution of ice-snowmelt water varied from 14.97% to 40.85%, that of rain varied from 9.04% to 54.80%, and that of groundwater varied from 15.34% to 58.85%, and they also showed that baseflow is a factor connecting melt water and groundwater, which meant the Hotan River and the Yarkand River are melt water-dependent rivers, and seasonal precipitation is the main water supply source of baseflow in the Aksu River and the Kaidu River.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000380764800019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B286%26rft.atitle%3DIsotopic%2BCharacterization%2Bof%2BRiver%2BWaters%2Band%2BWater%2BSource%2BIdentification%2Bin%2Ban%2BInland%2BRiver%252C%2BCentral%2BAsia%26rft.aufirst%3DYuting%26rft.auinit%3DYT%26rft.aulast%3DFan%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw8070286%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2073-4441%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DFan%252C%2BYT%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BYN%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w8070286,"inland river,stable isotopes,hydrograph separation,arid catchments hydrology","STABLE-ISOTOPES,TARIM RIVER,PRECIPITATION,IMPACTS,CLIMATE,BASIN,HYDROLOGY,PROGRESS",,"China Meteorol Adm, Inst Desert Meteorol, Xinjiang Lab Tree Ring Ecol, Key Lab Tree Ring Phys & Chem Res, Urumqi 830002, Peoples R China"
48,48,"Thompson, AF",Jun 1 2020 ,Comparing Discharge Computation Methods in Great Lakes Connecting Channels,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"Records of discharge for the connecting channels within the Great Lakes Basin are important to national governments of Canada and the United States and the various water management agencies and users in the basin. For more than 100 years, the official discharge records for the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, two connecting channels within the Great Lakes Basin, have been computed using various stage-fall-discharge (SFQ) methods. However, as a result of technological advancements, newer methods have recently been considered for discharge computations. In this study, three discharge computation methods were compared: two SFQ methods and the index-velocity discharge (IVQ) method. Although the two SFQ methods have significantly different assumptions and use different data from the index-velocity method, the differences between the computed discharges derived from the methods are small, especially as the time step approaches monthly discharge values. Statistical analyses of discharge measurements and discharges computed using each of these methods indicate that there is no substantive difference in the discharges computed using the three methods. However, the IVQ method provides distinct advantages over the SFQ methods, including increased temporal resolution of computed discharge (minutes versus daily) and the ability to account for changes caused by aquatic vegetation and ice. Based on the results of the comparisons described herein, the IVQ discharge computation method is the most appropriate method for discharge computation in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. Updated SFQ equations for the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, also presented herein, can be used to compute discharge during periods of missing or invalid IVQ record.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000527795100006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B05020007%26rft.atitle%3DComparing%2BDischarge%2BComputation%2BMethods%2Bin%2BGreat%2BLakes%2BConnecting%2BChannels%26rft.aufirst%3DAaron%2BF.%26rft.auinit%3DAF%26rft.aulast%3DThompson%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HE.1943-5584.0001904%26rft.eissn%3D1943-5584%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1084-0699%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DThompson%252C%2BAF%26rft.au%3DRodrigues%252C%2BSN%26rft.au%3DCalappi%252C%2BTJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001904,"St,Clair River,Detroit River,Great Lakes connecting channels,Coordinating committee,Stage-fall-discharge,Index velocity",,,"Environm & Climate Change Canada, Tech & Data Serv, 867 Lakeshore Rd, Burlington, ON L7S 1A1, Canada"
49,49,"Hensley, RT",Jul 2012 ,Controls on solute transport in large spring-fed karst rivers,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"The spring-fed rivers of North Florida flow across a karst plain, leading us to predict significant hyporheic transient storage within the secondary porosity of the carbonate media. They also span a gradient of submerged macrophyte cover and density, offering an opportunity to investigate reach-scale vegetation effects on dispersion and transient storage. Conservative tracer tests using Rhodamine WT were conducted on nine rivers spanning the extant range of vegetative and geomorphologic characteristics. A one-dimensional advection-dispersion-storage model with variable configurations of storage zones was fit to tracer breakthrough curves to determine optimal model coefficients as well as storage-zone configuration (i.e., single, two in parallel, two in series). In most cases, two zones in series best fit the observed breakthrough curves. Moreover, fitted storage-zone attributes were significantly correlated across springs with field-measured analogs (i.e., vegetation area for storage zone 1, sediment area for zone 2), supporting inference that this model configuration physically represents the river systems. While the hyporheic zone area was large, its effect on transient storage was not, presumably because low-hydraulic-conductivity sediments and weak hydraulic gradients limit exchange with the secondary porosity of karst matrix; tracer mass recovery uniformly near 100% underscores the absence of significant hydraulic turnover. Vegetation was a significant predictor of transient storage, mean velocity, and mean residence time, suggesting that plant beds exert important controls on reach-scale hydraulics in these systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000307269300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DControls%2Bon%2Bsolute%2Btransport%2Bin%2Blarge%2Bspring-fed%2Bkarst%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DRT%26rft.aulast%3DHensley%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.2012.57.4.0912%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D924%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D912-924%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D912%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DHensley%252C%2BRT%26rft.au%3DCohen%252C%2BMJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A842rfIDuzr9JRdDbngbvZ&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.2012.57.4.0912,,"TRANSIENT STORAGE,MOUNTAIN STREAM,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,FLORIDA SPRINGS,WATER EXCHANGE,RHODAMINE WT,NITROGEN,OREGON,MODEL,FLOW",,"Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA"
