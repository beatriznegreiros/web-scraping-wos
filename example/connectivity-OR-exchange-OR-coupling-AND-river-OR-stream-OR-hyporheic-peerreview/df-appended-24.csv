0,0,"Glotov, VE",Oct 2011 ,Terrane Tectonics in the Formation of the Groundwater Runoff in the Active Water-Exchange Zone of Mountainous River Valleys in the Cryolithozone,RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PACIFIC GEOLOGY,"The significant role of the drainage area's geological background in the formation of the ground-water runoff in the active water-exchange zone was revealed for the first time on the basis of long-term observations of streams of the Upper Kolyma River region during the autumn-winter low-water period, when the rivers are fed only by the groundwater recharge. The analysis of all the available data made it possible to define the characteristic periods in the autumn-winter low-water season. The waters of the seasonally thawed layer play the dominant role in the river's recharge in September; the suprapermafrost water, in January; and the subgelisol water (nonfreezing water streams) during the 30-day-long period of the minimal flow. The quantitative parameters of the groundwater runoff corresponding to its module during this period reflect the water influx to the active water-exchange zone. It is established that the latter is minimal in the In'yali-Debin synclinorium, which consists of sedimentary rocks formed in deepwater trough environments. Their subsequent transformation proceeded under the action of subduction-accretionary and shear strains. The water avail-ability in the active water-exchange in the Ayan-Yuryakh anticlinorium zone is substantially higher, although the Late Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic sedimentary formations of this area were also deposited in deepwater trough settings, but their subsequent evolution was related to the uplift of the anticlinorium. The maximal watering is observed in the active water-exchange zone of the Omulevka terrane, which is composed of Paleozoic terrigenous-carbonate and carbonate formations. The differences in the hydrogeological regimes of the terranes may be significant with respect to their geoecology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000297928800008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTerrane%2BTectonics%2Bin%2Bthe%2BFormation%2Bof%2Bthe%2BGroundwater%2BRunoff%2Bin%2Bthe%2BActive%2BWater-Exchange%2BZone%2Bof%2BMountainous%2BRiver%2BValleys%2Bin%2Bthe%2BCryolithozone%26rft.aufirst%3DV.%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DVE%26rft.aulast%3DGlotov%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1134%252FS1819714011050034%26rft.epage%3D468%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1819-7140%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DRUSSIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BPACIFIC%2BGEOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D458-468%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D458%26rft.stitle%3DRUSS%2BJ%2BPAC%2BGEOL%26rft.volume%3D5%26rft.au%3DGlotov%252C%2BVE%26rft.au%3DGlotova%252C%2BLP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=RUSSIAN+JOURNAL+OF+PACIFIC+GEOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1134/S1819714011050034,"cryolithozone,mountainous areas,terranes,surface runoff,groundwater,active water-exchange zone,Kolyma River basin,northeastern Russia",,,"Russian Acad Sci, Far E Branch, NE Complex Res Inst, Ul Portovaya 16, Magadan 685000, Russia"
1,1,"Lai, XJ",Jun 7 2013 ,Large-scale hydrodynamic modeling of the middle Yangtze River Basin with complex river-lake interactions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The flow regime in the middle Yangtze River Basin is experiencing rapid changes due to intensive human activities and ongoing climate change. The middle reach of Yangtze River and the associated water system are extremely difficult to be reliably modeled due to highly complex interactions between the main stream and many tributaries and lakes. This paper presents a new Coupled Hydrodynamic Analysis Model (CHAM) designed for simulating the large-scale water system in the middle Yangtze River Basin, featured with complex river-lake interactions. CHAM dynamically couples a one-dimensional (1-D) unsteady flow model and a two-dimensional (2-D) hydrodynamic model using a new coupling algorithm that is particularly suitable for large-scale water systems. Numerical simulations are carried out to reproduce the flow regime in the region in 1998 when a severe flood event occurred and in 2006 when it experienced an extremely dry year. The model is able to reproduce satisfactorily the major physical processes featured with seasonal wetting and drying controlled by strong river-lake interactions. This indicates that the present model provides a promising tool for predicting complex flow regimes with remarkable seasonal changes and strong river-lake interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

2,2,"Rahman, MATMT",Jul 2021 ,"Lateral and longitudinal flight dispersals of a stonefly, Alloperla ishikariana (Plecoptera, Chloroperlidae), from the hyporheic zone in a gravel-bed river in Japan",LIMNOLOGICA,"The life-history traits of amphibitic insects are not well understood. These insects inhabit saturated interstitial areas below the riverbed (hyporheic zone) at the larval stage, mate in terrestrial habitats, and return to rivers for oviposition, but there is no knowledge concerning their dispersal characteristics. We sought to address this by examining how far amphibitic insects disperse away from the channel (laterally) and along upstream or downstream (longitudinally) in a gravel-bed river. Alloperla ishikariana was selected as the focal species because it numerically dominates other amphibites in an 18-km study segment of a 4th-order gravel-bed river in Hokkaido, Northern Japan. Malaise traps were set at various distances from the channel towards the riparian forest to estimate lateral dispersal distances. An elevated stable nitrogen isotope ratio in downstream larvae, caused by the influence of effluent from a wastewater treatment plant, was used to assess longitudinal dispersal by identifying and tracking adult movements. Laterally, 50th and 90th percentile dispersal distances were 11.66 and 35.09 m for female A. ishikariana and 20.59 and 59.20 m for male, respectively; this overlapped with distances previously estimated for other aquatic benthic taxa. Longitudinally, 50th and 90th percentile dispersal distances were 0.74 and 1.43 km for female and 3.11 and 7.87 km for male, respectively. Alloperla ishikariana had one of the longest upstream traveling distances compared with other aquatic insects, and the longest among Plecoptera taxa known thus far where male exhibited a greater dispersal distance. A higher number of adults demonstrated upstream movement, suggesting an upstream bias in the longitudinal dispersal of A. ishikariana. Overall, amphibitic stoneflies did not exhibit distinct dispersal characteristics compared with the results of previous reports on presumably benthic taxa. Our findings support an improved visualization of a multi-dimensionally connected river ecosystem in terms of material flow, including vertical connectivity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000670533800005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B125886%26rft.atitle%3DLateral%2Band%2Blongitudinal%2Bflight%2Bdispersals%2Bof%2Ba%2Bstonefly%252C%2BAlloperla%2Bishikariana%2B%2528Plecoptera%252C%2BChloroperlidae%2529%252C%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bin%2Ba%2Bgravel-bed%2Briver%2Bin%2BJapan%26rft.aufirst%3DMirza%2BA.%2BT.%2BM.%2BTanvir%26rft.auinit%3DMATMT%26rft.aulast%3DRahman%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.limno.2021.125886%26rft.eissn%3D1873-5851%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0075-9511%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGICA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOLOGICA%26rft.volume%3D89%26rft.au%3DRahman%252C%2BMATMT%26rft.au%3DNegishi%252C%2BJN%26rft.au%3DPongsivapai%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGICA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.limno.2021.125886,"Adult aquatic insects,Amphibites,Chloroperlidae,Flight distance,Stable nitrogen isotope ratio","ADULT CADDISFLIES TRICHOPTERA,AQUATIC INSECTS,STREAM,EMERGENCE,METAPOPULATION,PERSPECTIVE,ENRICHMENT,CATCHMENTS,MIGRATION,NITROGEN",,"Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Environm Sci, N10 W5, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan"
3,3,"Harmon, RS",Jan-feb 2021 ,"Geochemistry of contrasting stream types, Taylor Valley, Antarctica",GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN,"The McMurdo Dry Valley region is the largest ice-free area of Antarctica. Ephemeral streams flow here during the austral summer, transporting glacial meltwater to perennially ice-covered, closed basin lakes. The chemistry of 24 Taylor Valley streams was examined over the two-decade period of monitoring from 1993 to 2014, and the geochemical behavior of two streams of contrasting physical and biological character was monitored across the seven weeks of the 2010-2011 flow season. Four species dominate stream solute budgets: HCO3-, Ca2+, Na+, and Cl-, with SO42-, Mg2+, and K+ present in significantly lesser proportions. All streams contain dissolved silica at low concentrations. Across Taylor Valley, streams are characterized by their consistent anionic geochemical fingerprint of HCO3 > Cl > SO4, but there is a split in cation composition between 14 streams with Ca > Na > Mg > K and 10 streams with Na > Ca > Mg > K.Andersen Creek is a first-order proglacial stream representative of the 13 short streams that flow <1.5 km from source to gage. Von Guerard is representative of 11 long streams 2-7 km in length characterized by extensive hyporheic zones. Both streams exhibit a strong daily cycle for solute load, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, which vary in proportion to discharge. A well-expressed diurnal co-variation of pH with dissolved oxygen is observed for both streams that reflects different types of biological control. The relative consistency of Von Guerard composition over the summer flow season reflects chemostatic regulation, where water in transient storage introduced during times of high streamflow has an extended opportunity for water-sediment interaction, silicate mineral dissolution, and pore-water exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000618060000029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGeochemistry%2Bof%2Bcontrasting%2Bstream%2Btypes%252C%2BTaylor%2BValley%252C%2BAntarctica%26rft.aufirst%3DRussell%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DRS%26rft.aulast%3DHarmon%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1130%252FB35479.1%26rft.eissn%3D1943-2674%26rft.epage%3D448%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0016-7606%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%2BOF%2BAMERICA%2BBULLETIN%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D425-448%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D425%26rft.stitle%3DGEOL%2BSOC%2BAM%2BBULL%26rft.volume%3D133%26rft.au%3DHarmon%252C%2BRS%26rft.au%3DLeslie%252C%2BDL%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=GEOLOGICAL+SOCIETY+OF+AMERICA+BULLETIN&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1130/B35479.1,,"MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS,GLACIAL MELTWATER STREAMS,SOUTHERN VICTORIA LAND,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,CRYOCONITE HOLES,FRYXELL BASIN,POLAR DESERT,ROSS SEA,HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY,CO2 CONSUMPTION",,"North Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA"
4,4,"Mermillod-Blondin, F",Jun 2000 ,"Distribution of solutes, microbes and invertebrates in river sediments along a riffle-pool-riffle sequence",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Unlike riffles, research has focused rarely on the hyporheic zone of pools. To highlight the functioning of a pool, field investigations were performed in a riffle-pool-riffle sequence by integrating simultaneously physico-chemistry, microbes and invertebrates. The study was conducted in a channel characterised by strong downwelling of surface water.2. To include the downstream flux of water within the sediment, a longitudinal profile was studied along six stations situated: at the centre (Station 1) and at the lower end (Station 2) of the first riffle, at the upstream part (Station 3), at the centre (Station 4, at the inflection point) and at the lower end (Station 5) of the pool, and at the centre of the second riffle (Station 6). At each station, three replicate samples were taken and three sample depths were investigated (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 m below the stream bed) on two dates.3. Physico-chemical parameters (vertical hydraulic gradient, oxygen concentration and specific conductance) differed between stations depending on infiltration rates. In contrast, organic matter and microbial parameters presented patchy distributions linked with factors other than the geomorphological pattern. Despite not very pronounced geomorphologic features, the slope variation at the centre of the pool (at the inflection point) affects the distribution of epigean and hypogean invertebrates.4. Based upon faunal parameters, the pool could be divided into an upstream and a downstream part, the latter being more strongly influenced by surface water.5. The pool should be considered as a heterogeneous area. In that respect, the inflection point of a pool may be as important as the top of a riffle in the functioning of river sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000087864300007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDistribution%2Bof%2Bsolutes%252C%2Bmicrobes%2Band%2Binvertebrates%2Bin%2Briver%2Bsediments%2Balong%2Ba%2Briffle-pool-riffle%2Bsequence%26rft.aufirst%3DF%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DMermillod-Blondin%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.2000.00562.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D269%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D255-269%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D255%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DMermillod-Blondin%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DDes%2BChatelliers%252C%2BMC%26rft.au%3DDole-Olivier%252C%2BMJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00562.x,"hyporheic zone,pool,riffle,hypogean fauna,metabolism","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,RHONE RIVER,SURFACE,WATER,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,HETEROGENEITY,COMMUNITIES",,"Univ Lyon 1, Lab Ecol Hydrosyst Fluviaux Hydrobiol & Ecol Sout, CNRS, ESA 5023, 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"
5,5,"Kaushal, SS",Apr 2008 ,Effects of stream restoration on denitrification in an urbanizing watershed,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Increased delivery of nitrogen due to urbanization and stream ecosystem degradation is contributing to eutrophication in coastal regions of the eastern United States. We tested whether geomorphic restoration involving hydrologic ""reconnection'' of a stream to its floodplain could increase rates of denitrification at the riparian-zone-stream interface of an urban stream in Baltimore, Maryland. Rates of denitrification measured using in situ N-15 tracer additions were spatially variable across sites and years and ranged from undetectable to > 200 mu g N center dot( kg sediment)(-1) center dot d(-1). Mean rates of denitrification were significantly greater in the restored reach of the stream at 77.4 +/- 12.6 mu g N center dot kg(-1) center dot d(-1) ( mean 6 SE) as compared to the unrestored reach at 34.8 +/- 8.0 mu g N center dot kg(-1) center dot d(-1). Concentrations of nitrate-N in groundwater and stream water in the restored reach were also significantly lower than in the unrestored reach, but this may have also been associated with differences in sources and hydrologic flow paths. Riparian areas with low, hydrologically ""connected'' streambanks designed to promote flooding and dissipation of erosive force for storm water management had substantially higher rates of denitrification than restored high ""nonconnected'' banks and both unrestored low and high banks. Coupled measurements of hyporheic groundwater flow and in situ denitrification rates indicated that up to 1.16 mg NO3--N could be removed per liter of groundwater flow through one cubic meter of sediment at the riparian-zone-stream interface over a mean residence time of 4.97 d in the unrestored reach, and estimates of mass removal of nitrate-N in the restored reach were also considerable. Mass removal of nitrate-N appeared to be strongly influenced by hydrologic residence time in unrestored and restored reaches. Our results suggest that stream restoration designed to ""reconnect'' stream channels with floodplains can increase denitrification rates, that there can be substantial variability in the efficacy of stream restoration designs, and that more work is necessary to elucidate which designs can be effective in conjunction with watershed strategies to reduce nitrate-N sources to streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000255437500020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bstream%2Brestoration%2Bon%2Bdenitrification%2Bin%2Ban%2Burbanizing%2Bwatershed%26rft.aufirst%3DSujay%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DSS%26rft.aulast%3DKaushal%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1890%252F07-1159.1%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5582%26rft.epage%3D804%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1051-0761%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D789-804%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D789%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DKaushal%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DGroffman%252C%2BPM%26rft.au%3DGold%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1890/07-1159.1,"Chesapeake Bay,USA,eutrophication,nitrogen,stream restoration,urbanization","PUSH-PULL TEST,CHESAPEAKE BAY,NITRATE REMOVAL,NITROGEN-RETENTION,NUTRIENT-UPTAKE,UNITED-STATES,SINGLE-WELL,RIPARIAN,RIVER,GROUNDWATER",,"Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, 1 Williams St,POB 38, Solomons, MD 20688 USA"
6,6,"Salheddine, M",Sep 2020 ,A coupled 1-D/2-D model for simulating river sediment transport and bed evolution,JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,"The paper details the method to couple a 1-D hydro-sedimentary model to a 2-D hydro-sedimentary model in order to represent the hydrodynamics and morphological processes during a flood event along a river. Tested on two field cases, the coupled model is stable even in the case of generalized overflow over the riverbanks or of levee breaching. For lateral coupling, the coupled model allows saving computational time compared to a full 2-D model and to provide valuable results concerning the flooding features as well as the evolution of the bed topography. However, despite a similar simplified representation of the sediment features in the 1-D and 2-D models, some discrepancies appear in the case of upstream/downstream coupling along a cross section perpendicular to the flow direction because the assumption of homogeneous velocity and concentration is not valid for estimating sediment transport. Further research is necessary to be able to define a suitable distribution of the sediments on the 1-D side of the boundary between the two models.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000576403000009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bcoupled%2B1-D%252F2-D%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bsimulating%2Briver%2Bsediment%2Btransport%2Band%2Bbed%2Bevolution%26rft.aufirst%3DMezbache%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DSalheddine%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fhydro.2020.020%26rft.eissn%3D1465-1734%26rft.epage%3D1137%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1464-7141%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROINFORMATICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1122-1137%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1122%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROINFORM%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DSalheddine%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DAndre%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DMahmoud%252C%2BH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROINFORMATICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/hydro.2020.020,"coupled model,floods,numerical scheme,river morphology,sediment",FLOW,,"INRAE, 5 Rue Doua,CS 20244, F-69625 Villeurbanne, France"
7,7,"Han, BS",Nov 2015 ,Streambed and water profile response to in-channel restoration structures in a laboratory meandering stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In-channel structures are often installed in alluvial rivers during restoration to steer currents, but they also modify the streambed morphology and water surface profile, and alter hydraulic gradients driving ecologically important hyporheic exchange. Although river features before and after restoration need to be compared, few studies have collected detailed observations to facilitate this comparison. We created a laboratory mobile-bed alluvial meandering river and collected detailed measurements in the highly sinuous meander before and after installation of in-channel structures, which included one cross vane and six J-hooks situated along 1 bar unit. Measurements of streambed and water surface elevation with sub-millimeter vertical accuracy and horizontal resolution were obtained using close-range photogrammetry. Compared to the smooth gradually varied water surface profile for control runs without structures, the structures created rapidly varied flow with subcritical to supercritical flow transitions, as well as backwater and forced-morphology pools, which increased volumetric storage by 74% in the entire stream reach. The J-hooks, located along the outer bank of the meander bend and downstream of the cross vane, created stepwise patterns in the streambed and water surface longitudinal profiles. The pooling of water behind the cross vane increased the hydraulic gradient across the meander neck by 1% and increased local ground-water gradients by 4%, with smaller increases across other transects through the intrameander zone. Scour pools developed downstream of the cross vane and around the J-hooks situated near the meander apex. In-channel structures significantly changed meander bend hydraulic gradients, and the detailed streambed and water surface 3-D maps provide valuable data for computational modeling of changes to hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000368420000036,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStreambed%2Band%2Bwater%2Bprofile%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Bin-channel%2Brestoration%2Bstructures%2Bin%2Ba%2Blaboratory%2Bmeandering%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DBangshuai%26rft.auinit%3DBS%26rft.aulast%3DHan%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017177%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D9324%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D9312-9324%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D9312%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DHan%252C%2BBS%26rft.au%3DChu%252C%2BHH%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BTA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015WR017177,,"HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE FLOW,RIVER RESTORATION,BED FORMS,BEAVER DAMS,DESIGN,GROUNDWATER,REACHES,CLASSIFICATION,HETEROGENEITY,DOWNSTREAM",,
8,8,"Wright, N",,An empirical test of groundwater pumping effects on river flow and temperature: Chemainus River case study,CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL,"Groundwater abstraction from pumping wells can reduce the flows and water levels of hydraulically connected surface waters, which can affect aquatic communities and water rights of other users. Four pump tests were implemented in the 2016 summer low-flow period to measure groundwater pumping effects to Chemainus River surface water flow and temperature. The effect of pumping on surface flow was estimated using four metrics based on differences between measured and predicted flow at a hydrometric gauge located 340 m from the groundwater wells. Differences were estimated as residuals from a regression model relating flow at this gauge to flow at a gauge 1.3 km upstream of the wells. The effect of pumping on surface water temperature was assessed using daily maximum and daily average water temperature at gauges located 340 m and 1.4 km downstream of the wells. An effect of pumping on river flow was measurable when the pumps were turned on and shut off. The consistency of measured effects across all tests and the absence of discernable trends within and across tests indicate that the average effect of pumping across a broader period is equivalent to the average of all before and after comparisons, which was estimated as 9.9 L/s +/- 12.1 L/s, or 5.5% of river discharge at the time of the tests. Groundwater pumping did not result in a detectable shift in water temperature. The results indicate that changes in water temperature in relation to the pump tests were smaller in magnitude or spatial scale than the detection limits of the implemented experimental design. This case study provides an example of quantification of pumping effects on stream flow and temperature, as required by the Water Sustainability Act for licensing of groundwater abstraction. We suggest this approach could be used elsewhere to quantify effects of groundwater abstraction.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000865236900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2Bempirical%2Btest%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%2Bpumping%2Beffects%2Bon%2Briver%2Bflow%2Band%2Btemperature%253A%2BChemainus%2BRiver%2Bcase%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DNicole%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DWright%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F07011784.2022.2129093%26rft.eissn%3D1918-1817%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0701-1784%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BJ%26rft.au%3DWright%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DHatfield%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+WATER+RESOURCES+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/07011784.2022.2129093,"Groundwater abstraction,groundwater-surface water hydraulic connectivity,pump test,stream flow,river temperature","WATER ABSTRACTION,STREAM,ECOLOGY,IMPACT",,"Ecofish Res Ltd, 600 Comox Rd, Courtenay, BC V9N 3P6, Canada"
9,9,"Wang, WK",May 15 2014 ,Estimating streambed parameters for a disconnected river,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Evaluation of stream-aquifer interaction and water balance for a catchment often requires specific information on streambed parameters, such as streambed hydraulic conductivity, seepage flux across the streambed and so on. This paper describes a simple, inexpensive instrument that is used to measure these streambed parameters under the condition of a stream disconnected from groundwater. Our method includes a seepage cylinder for simulation of river water depth. The proposed method was applied to estimate the vertical hydraulic conductivity of a streambed and the changes in vertical seepage rate from stream to groundwater with varied stream water depth in the Manasi River of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The vertical hydraulic conductivities of the streambed determined from 12 sites along the Manasi River vary from 1.01 to 29.m/day where the stream disconnects from the groundwater. The experimental results suggest that there are two kinds of relations between the vertical seepage rate and the simulated stream water depth. One is a linear relation between the two variables with low Reynolds numbers (less than 10); the other is a nonlinear relation (exponential relation) between the two variables with larger Reynolds numbers (greater than 10). This second relationship is quite different from the traditional model that usually calculates the vertical seepage rate from stream to groundwater under the condition of disconnection using a linear relation (Darcy's Law). Our results suggest that a linear relation can only be used for a limited range of river water depth. This method gives a convenient tool for rapidly estimating the streambed hydraulic conductivity and the changes in the vertical seepage rate across streambed with varied stream water depths for the case of a stream disconnected from groundwater.

10,10,"Zhou, NQ",Jan 13 2011 ,"A coupling simulation based on a hydrodynamics and water quality model of the Pearl River Delta, China",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The rapid economic development has caused heavy pollution in the Pearl River Delta Region (PRDR) and neighboring regions. In order to investigate the polluted characteristics, a coupled modelling approach has been deployed and the study area in the Pear River Delta is divided into two modelling systems: a river network that is simulated by a 1D hydrodynamic and water quality model, and an estuary that is modelled by a 3D model. The 1D river network model is coupled with the 3D estuary model based on the mass conservation criteria. The hydrodynamic (HD) model is based on 1D hydrostatic shallow water equations, and is solved by the Alternating Direction Implicit Approach. The water quality (WQ) model component is based on advection-diffusion equations. Some physical and bio-chemical processes are included in the WQ model to address the water pollution problems by different pollution substances, in particular, to the chemical oxygen demand (COD). The water quality data of the main rivers from 2004 to 2007 were collected, processed and evaluated. Because no detailed water quality data in the river is available, the COD source pollution intensity in the water quality model is taking the pollutant load from the confluence of the main five outlets of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) for 1996-2007 as surrogate. The results show that the pollutants from the PRDR have a large impact on the quality of the Hong Kong seawater and much more serious in the wet season with high river discharge. An insight of the flow and transportation mechanism in the river and estuary system has been obtained through the paper, and a reliable basis to control water pollution of the Pearl River Delta is provided in this paper.

Currently, existing network-scale biogeochemistry research, although robust, typically treats each of these components separately or reductively. Here, we incorporate lake morphometry into a fully connected stream/lake network for the Connecticut River watershed and model potential evasion of terrestrially sourced headwater CO2 as transported through the network, ignoring in-stream production. We found that approximately 25%-30% of total potential soil CO2 evasion occurs in lakes, and percent evasion is inversely related to streamflow. A lake's ability to evade CO2 is controlled by residence time and size: most lakes with residence time over 7 days or surface area greater than 0.004 km(2) evade functionally all terrestrial CO2 entering from upstream, precluding further downstream transport. We conclude that lakes are important for soil CO2 degassing and that this coupled river/lake approach is promising for CO2 studies henceforth.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000612943500054,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020GL090068%26rft.atitle%3DLake%2BMorphometry%2Band%2BRiver%2BNetwork%2BControls%2Bon%2BEvasion%2Bof%2BTerrestrially%2BSourced%2BHeadwater%2BCO2%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DCB%26rft.aulast%3DBrinkerhoff%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020GL090068%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DBrinkerhoff%252C%2BCB%26rft.au%3DRaymond%252C%2BPA%26rft.au%3DGleason%252C%2BCJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020GL090068,"biogeochemistry,CO2,greenhouse gas,hydrology,river network,streamflow routing","GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,DIOXIDE,STREAMS,EXCHANGE,CATCHMENTS,NUTRIENT,EFFLUX,DRIVEN,VOLUME",,"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA"
12,12,"Lehr, C",Aug 2015 ,A novel method to evaluate the effect of a stream restoration on the spatial pattern of hydraulic connection of stream and groundwater,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Stream restoration aims at an enhancement of ecological habitats, an increase of water retention within a landscape and sometimes even at an improvement of biogeochemical functions of lotic ecosystems. For the latter, good exchange between groundwater and stream water is often considered to be of major importance. In this study hydraulic connectivity between river and aquifer was investigated for a four years period, covering the restoration of an old oxbow after the second year. The oxbow became reconnected to the stream and the clogging layer in the oxbow was excavated. We expected increasing hydraulic connectivity between oxbow and aquifer after restoration of the stream, and decreasing hydraulic connectivity for the former shortcut due to increased clogging. To test that hypothesis, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the coupled groundwater-stream water system before and after the restoration were analysed by principal component analyses of time series of groundwater heads and stream water levels. The first component depicted between 53% and 70% of the total variance in the dataset for the different years. It captured the propagation of the pressure signal induced by stream water level fluctuations throughout the adjacent aquifer. Thus it could be used as a measure of hydraulic connectivity between stream and aquifer. During the first year, the impact of stream water level fluctuations decreased with distance from the regulated river (shortcut), whereas the hydraulic connection of the oxbow to the adjacent aquifer was very low. After restoration of the stream we observed a slight but not significant increase of hydraulic connectivity in the oxbow in the second year after restoration, but no change for the former shortcut. There is some evidence that the pattern of hydraulic connectivity at the study site is by far more determined by the natural heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivities of the floodplain sediments and the initial construction of the shortcut rather than by the clogging layer in the oxbow.

13,13,"Teitelbaum, Y",Feb 28 2022 ,A Novel Framework for Simulating Particle Deposition With Moving Bedforms,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Previous modeling studies of hyporheic exchange induced by moving bedforms have used a moving reference frame, typically corresponding to an individual moving bedform. However, this approach is not suitable for simulating the exchange and accumulation of immobile fine particles beneath moving bedforms, which commonly occurs in sand-bed streams, as both moving and stationary features must be considered. Here we present a novel simulation framework that may represent arbitrarily shaped, generally aperiodic mobile bedforms within a stationary reference frame. We combine this approach with particle tracking to successfully reproduce observations of clay deposition in sand beds, and the resulting development of a low-conductivity layer near the scour zone. We find that increased bedform celerity and filtration both lead to a shallower depth of clay deposition and a more compact deposition layer. While increased filtration causes more clay to deposit, increased celerity reduces deposition by flattening hyporheic exchange flowpaths.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000765659300092,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021GL097223%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BNovel%2BFramework%2Bfor%2BSimulating%2BParticle%2BDeposition%2BWith%2BMoving%2BBedforms%26rft.aufirst%3DYoni%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DTeitelbaum%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021GL097223%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DTeitelbaum%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DShimony%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DArnon%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021GL097223,"Hyporheic exchange,Particle deposition,Mobile bedforms,Migrating bedforms,Eulerian reference frame,Moving boundary model","ORGANIC-MATTER,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,COLLOID TRANSPORT,STREAM,SIZE,SAND,RETENTION,RESIDENCE,MIGRATION",,"Ben Gurion Negev, Zuckerberg Inst Water Res, Jacob Balustein Inst Desert Res, Beer Sheva, Israel"
14,14,"Jarvie, HP",Dec 4 2018 ,Coupling High-Frequency Stream Metabolism and Nutrient Monitoring to Explore Biogeochemical Controls on Downstream Nitrate Delivery,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Instream biogeochemical process measurements are often short-term and localized. Here we use in situ sensors to quantify the net effects of biogeochemical processes on seasonal patterns in baseflow nitrate retention at the river-reach scale. Dual-station high-frequency in situ nitrate measurements, were coupled with high-frequency measurements of stream metabolism and dissolved inorganic carbon, in a tributary of the Buffalo National River, Arkansas. Nitrate assimilation was calculated from net primary production, and combined with mass-balance measurements, to estimate net nitrification and denitrification. The combined net effects of these instream processes (assimilation, denitrification, and nitrification) removed >30-90% of the baseflow nitrate load along a 6.5 km reach. Assimilation of nitrate by photoautotrophs during spring and early summer was buffered by net nitrification. Net nitrification peaked during the spring. After midsummer, there was a pronounced switch from assimilatory nitrate uptake to denitrification. There was clear synchronicity between the switch from nitrate assimilation to denitrification, a reduction in river baseflows, and a shift in stream metabolism from autotrophy to heterotrophy. The results show how instream nitrate retention and downstream delivery is driven by seasonal shifts in metabolic pathways; and how continuous in situ stream sensor networks offer new opportunities for quantifying the role of stream biota in the dynamics, fate, and transport of nitrogen in fluvial systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000452693500006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BHigh-Frequency%2BStream%2BMetabolism%2Band%2BNutrient%2BMonitoring%2Bto%2BExplore%2BBiogeochemical%2BControls%2Bon%2BDownstream%2BNitrate%2BDelivery%26rft.aufirst%3DHelen%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DHP%26rft.aulast%3DJarvie%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.est.8b03074%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D13717%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D23%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D13708-13717%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D13708%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DJarvie%252C%2BHP%26rft.au%3DSharpley%252C%2BAN%26rft.au%3DBerry%252C%2BLG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/acs.est.8b03074,,"IN-SITU,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,PHOSPHORUS RETENTION,SUSPENDED SEDIMENT,HEADWATER STREAMS,NITROGEN UPTAKE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,RIVERS,WATER,DENITRIFICATION",,"NERC Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England"
15,15,"Billett, MF",Feb 10 2004 ,Linking land-atmosphere-stream carbon fluxes in a lowland peatland system,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,"Any change in the ability of northern peatlands to act as a sink for atmospheric CO2 will play a crucial part in the response of the Earth system to global warming. We argue that a true assessment of the sink-source relationships of peatland ecosystems requires that losses of C in drainage waters be included when determining annual net C uptake, thus connecting measurements of stream C fluxes with those made at the land surface-atmosphere interface. This was done by combining estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) with stream water measurements of TOC, DIC, and gaseous C loss, in a 335-ha lowland temperate peatland catchment (55degrees48.80'N, 03degrees14.40'W) in central Scotland over a 2-year period (1996-1998). Mean annual downstream C flux was 304 (+/-62) kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), of which total organic carbon (TOC) contributed 93%, the remainder being dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and free CO2. At the catchment outlet evasion loss of CO2 from the stream surface was estimated to be an additional 46 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Over the study period, NEE of CO2-C resulted in a flux from the atmosphere to the land surface of 278 (+/-25) kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Net C loss in drainage water, including both the downstream flux and CO2 evasion from the stream surface to the atmosphere, was therefore greater or equal to the net annual C uptake as a result of photosynthesis/respiration at the land surface. By combining these and other flux terms, the overall C mass balance suggests that this system was either acting as a terrestrial C source or was C neutral.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000189051700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BGB1024%26rft.atitle%3DLinking%2Bland-atmosphere-stream%2Bcarbon%2Bfluxes%2Bin%2Ba%2Blowland%2Bpeatland%2Bsystem%26rft.aufirst%3DMF%26rft.auinit%3DMF%26rft.aulast%3DBillett%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2003GB002058%26rft.eissn%3D1944-9224%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0886-6236%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEMICAL%2BCYCLES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEM%2BCY%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DBillett%252C%2BMF%26rft.au%3DPalmer%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DFowler%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=GLOBAL+BIOGEOCHEMICAL+CYCLES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2003GB002058,"carbon flux,land-atmosphere exchange,peatland,stream","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,INORGANIC CARBON,CO2,EXCHANGE,WATER,DIOXIDE,BALANCE,EXPORT,BOG,CATCHMENTS",,"CEH Edinburgh, Bush Estate, Edinburgh EH26 0QB, Midlothian, Scotland"
16,16,"Mouhri, A",Nov 11 2013 ,Designing a multi-scale sampling system of stream-aquifer interfaces in a sedimentary basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A methodological framework is proposed for designing a multi-scale sampling system to quantify the stream-aquifer interactions in a multi-layer aquifer system. First, geophysical and drilling investigations are performed to assess the regional structure of the aquifer system and the local connectivity between streams and aquifer units. At the catchment scale, the investigations permit to define the composition of the upper aquifer unit. At the local scale, the connectivity status between streams and aquifer units is evaluated using various settings for electrical resistivity tomographies. These geophysical investigations are then used to select local monitoring stations (LMSs) along the stream network. Moreover, piezometric head maps representative of low and high flow regimes are interpolated using geostatistics, which provides distributions of both piezometric heads and standard deviations of the estimation error (STEE). The map of STEE is used to define the location of new piezometers. Altogether, the sampling system allows for monitoring water exchanges on a 40 km(2) watershed along 6 km of the stream network, with a finer hydro-geophysical sampling at each LMS. Finally, temperature profiles in the HZ are interpreted with a coupled thermo-hydro finite element code at the upstream station of the domain. Multiple simulations indicate first proof of evidence for a gaining stream in the upstream part of the sampling domain. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Two ocean-atmosphere interaction mechanisms are explored in detail: The Vertical Mixing Mechanism (VMM) associated with the intensification of downward momentum transfer, and the Pressure Adjustment Mechanism (PAM) associated with secondary circulations driven by pressure gradients. Both VMM and PAM are found to be active even in the eddy-parameterized models. However, increasing ocean and/or atmosphere resolution leads to enhanced ocean-atmosphere coupling and improved agreement with reanalysis and observations. Our results indicate that while one part of the stronger air-sea coupling is attributable to the refinement of the oceanic component to eddy-permitting, optimal results are obtained only by further increase of the atmosphere resolution too. The use of the eddy-resolving model show weaker or same coupling strength over the eddy-permitting resolution. We conclude that at least eddy-permiting ocean resolution and comparable atmosphere resolution are required for a reliable ocean-atmosphere coupling along the Gulf Stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000758305700002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2Bresolution%2Bon%2Bthe%2Batmosphere-ocean%2Bcoupling%2Balong%2Bthe%2BGulf%2BStream%2Bin%2Bglobal%2Bhigh%2Bresolution%2Bmodels%26rft.aufirst%3DE.%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DEE%26rft.aulast%3DTsartsali%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00382-021-06098-9%26rft.eissn%3D1432-0894%26rft.epage%3D3333%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0930-7575%26rft.issue%3D11-12%26rft.jtitle%3DCLIMATE%2BDYNAMICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3317-3333%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3317%26rft.stitle%3DCLIM%2BDYNAM%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DTsartsali%252C%2BEE%26rft.au%3DHaarsma%252C%2BRJ%26rft.au%3DRoberts%252C%2BCD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=CLIMATE+DYNAMICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00382-021-06098-9,"Air-sea interaction,Mesoscale coupling,Gulf Stream,Vertical mixing mechanism (VMM),Pressure adjustment mechanism (PAM)","SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE,LOW-LEVEL WINDS,SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS,KUROSHIO EXTENSION,NORTH WALL,CLIMATE,CONVERGENCE,VARIABILITY,WINTERTIME,GRADIENTS",,"Fdn Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Bologna, Italy"
18,18,"Bonanno, E",Aug 2021 ,Flow directions of stream-groundwater exchange in a headwater catchment during the hydrologic year,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Understanding near-stream groundwater dynamics and flow directions is important for predicting hillslope-stream connectivity, streamflow generation, and hydrologic controls of streamwater quality. To determine the drivers of groundwater flow in the stream corridor (i.e., the stream channel and the adjacent groundwater in footslopes and riparian areas), we observed the water levels of 36 wells and 7 piezometers along a headwater stream section over a period of 18 months. Groundwater dynamics during events were controlled by the initial position of the groundwater table relative to the subsurface structure. The near-stream groundwater table displayed a fast and pronounced response to precipitation events when lying in fractured bedrock with low storage capacity, and responded less frequently and in a less pronounced way when lying in upper layers with high storage capacity. Precipitation depth, intensity, regolith thickness above the fractured bedrock, and proximity to and elevation above the stream channel also had an effect on the groundwater dynamics, which varied with hydrologic conditions. Our high-frequency and spatially dense measurements highlight the competing influence of groundwater inflow from upslope locations, streamwater level and bedrock properties on the spatiotemporal dynamics of flowpaths in the stream corridor. Near-stream groundwater pointed uniformly towards the stream channel when the stream corridor was hydrologically connected to upslope groundwater. However, local interruptions of the water inflow from upslope locations caused flow reversals towards the footslopes. The direction of near-stream groundwater followed the local fractured bedrock topography during dry hydrologic conditions on a few occasions after events. The outcomes of this research contribute to a better understanding of the drivers controlling spatiotemporal changes in near-stream groundwater dynamics and flow directions in multiple wetness states of the stream corridor.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000691011400034,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14310%26rft.atitle%3DFlow%2Bdirections%2Bof%2Bstream-groundwater%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bcatchment%2Bduring%2Bthe%2Bhydrologic%2Byear%26rft.aufirst%3DEnrico%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DBonanno%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14310%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DBonanno%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DBloschl%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DKlaus%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14310,"connectivity,direction,groundwater dynamics,groundwater-surface water interaction,high frequency measurements,stream corridor","RIPARIAN ZONES,BEDROCK GROUNDWATER,RUNOFF GENERATION,HYPORHEIC ZONE,HILLSLOPE,CONNECTIVITY,DYNAMICS,VARIABILITY,STORAGE,STEEP",,"Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Catchment & Ecohydrol Grp, Belvaux, Luxembourg"
19,19,"Malcolm, IA",Nov 2005 ,Catchment-scale controls on groundwater-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone: Implications for salmon embryo survival,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The spatial and temporal variability of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions in the hyporheic zone were investigated in a semi-pristine upland salmon spawning catchment (Girnock Burn) in the Cairngorm Mountains, northeast Scotland. Stream and hyporheic water quality (200-300 mm depth) were monitored fortnightly at 16 spawning locations distributed throughout the catchment. Hydrochemical tracers were used to assess local GW-SW interactions. Stratified streambed incubators (50-300 mm) provided information on salmon embryo mortality at a sub-set of ten locations. Hyporheic water quality varied both temporally and spatially according to local GW-SW interactions. It was possible to categorize sites into three broad typologies reflecting local stream-aquifer interactions: (1) groundwater-dominated; (2) surface water-dominated; and (3) sites exhibiting transient water table features. Groundwater upwelling occurred in areas where low permeability glacial moraine features caused substantive valley constriction. These locations were also conducive to accumulation of spawning grade gravels and consequently were utilized heavily by spawning salmon. Long residence groundwater was typically characterized by low dissolved oxygen (DO), of sufficiently low quality to be detrimental to salmon embryo survival. At sites dominated by surface water, hyporheic DO remained high throughout and rates of embryo survival were correspondingly high. Survival rates were also high at sites where hydrochemical characteristics indicated a transient water table. This is probably attributable to the hydrological conditions which resulted in increasing DO concentrations towards hatch time when embryo oxygen demand is at its maximum. The degree to which the findings of this study are directly applicable to other catchments is currently unknown. However, similar effects have been observed elsewhere, and based on the information presented here, there are clear implications for fisheries managers who may wish to consider the use of surface incubation facilities to negate the effects of low DO groundwater upwelling where it dominates available spawning habitat. It is suggested that future research should aim to integrate across spatial scales and disciplines to obtain a better understanding of the ways in which hillslope and riparian zone hydrology affect GW-SW interactions, hyporheic zone processes and stream ecology.

20,20,"Descloux, S",Oct 2013 ,Benthic and hyporheic invertebrate assemblages along a gradient of increasing streambed colmation by fine sediment,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Streambed colmation by fine sediment, e.g. the deposition, accumulation and storage of fines in the substrate, is a major environmental concern throughout the world. Nevertheless, the ecological effects of streambed colmation on both benthic and hyporheic invertebrate assemblages have rarely been considered simultaneously. We studied a continuum of a naturally increasing percentage of fine sediment in three temperate rivers and hypothesized that the increasing percentage of fine sediment would decrease both benthic and hyporheic invertebrate densities and diversities, and reduce the similarities between them. To test these hypotheses, we first compared heavily, moderately and lightly clogged reaches located in downwelling areas and sampled invertebrates in the benthic zone and at 3 different depths (10, 30 and 50 cm) in the hyporheic zone. Secondly, we modified the sediment grain size distribution experimentally by increasing the percentage of fine sediment and using artificial substrates. The increasing colmation halved the hyporheic taxonomic richness and reduced benthic and hyporheic densities to a third. Some taxa were found in both zones, mainly in high colmation (e.g. Baetidae) or low colmation contexts (e.g. Orthocladiinae, Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida). The dissimilarity between benthic and hyporheic fauna (only at -50 cm) was significantly higher in heavily clogged reaches than in moderately and lightly clogged ones, suggesting reduced vertical exchange of invertebrates or differential impacts between zones. The total abundance, taxonomic richness, percentage of EPT taxa and densities of most organisms observed using the artificial substrates decreased linearly with the increasing percentage of fine sediment in the experiment. Only the Ephemeroptera Caenis spp. and Heptageniidae disappeared above 30 and 50 % of fine sediment, respectively, suggesting that the response to increasing colmation are strongly taxon-specific. High amount of fine sediments within the substrate significantly decreased habitat quality for benthic and hyporheic invertebrates and thus limit the production of streams and their capacity to recover after disturbance. Moreover, the use of hyporheic invertebrates seems more relevant than benthic invertebrates to assess the effect of colmation and thus could be tested in future research as indicators.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000324577500003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBenthic%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Binvertebrate%2Bassemblages%2Balong%2Ba%2Bgradient%2Bof%2Bincreasing%2Bstreambed%2Bcolmation%2Bby%2Bfine%2Bsediment%26rft.aufirst%3DStephane%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DDescloux%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-013-0295-6%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D507%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D493-507%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D493%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D75%26rft.au%3DDescloux%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00027-013-0295-6,"Clogging,Invertebrates,Biodiversity,Threshold effect,Vertical migration","VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION,LOTIC DISTURBANCE,MACROINVERTEBRATES,ZONE,BED,COMMUNITY,REFUGE,FEATURES,ECOLOGY,SURFACE",,"Savoie Technolac, Hydro Engn Ctr, EDF, F-73373 Le Bourget Du Lac, France"
21,21,"Tsai, CH",Jul 2022 ,Transient Storage Model Parameter Optimization Using the Simulated Annealing Method,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange in streams is critical to ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling along river corridors, especially for slowly moving or small stream systems. The transient storage model (TSM) has been widely used for modeling of hyporheic exchange. TSM calibration, for hyporheic exchange, is typically used to estimate four parameters, including the mass exchange rate coefficient, the dispersion coefficient, stream cross-sectional area, and hyporheic zone cross-sectional area. Prior studies have raised concerns regarding the non-uniqueness of the inverse problem for the TSM, that is, the occurrence of different parameter vectors resulting in TSM solution that reproduces the observed in-stream tracer break through curve (BTC) with the same error. This leads to practical non-identifiability in determining the unknown parameter vector values even when global-optimal values exist, and the parameter optimization becomes practically non-unique. To address this problem, we applied the simulated annealing method to calibrate the TSM to BTCs, because it is less susceptible to local minima-induced non-identifiability. A hypothetical (or synthetic) tracer test data set with known parameters was developed to demonstrate the capability of the simulated annealing method to find the global minimum parameter vector, and it identified the ""hypothetically-true"" global minimum parameter vector even with input data that were modified with up to 10% noise without increasing the number of iterations required for convergence. The simulated annealing TSM was then calibrated using two in-stream tracer tests conducted in East Fork Poplar Creek, Tennessee. Simulated annealing was determined to be appropriate for quantifying the TSM parameter vector because of its search capability for the global minimum parameter vector.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000825346400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2022WR032018%26rft.atitle%3DTransient%2BStorage%2BModel%2BParameter%2BOptimization%2BUsing%2Bthe%2BSimulated%2BAnnealing%2BMethod%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DCH%26rft.aulast%3DTsai%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2022WR032018%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DTsai%252C%2BCH%26rft.au%3DRucker%252C%2BDF%26rft.au%3DCarroll%252C%2BKC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2022WR032018,"simulated annealing,transient storage model,parameter optimization,hyporheic,TSM,parameter estimation","STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS,REACTIVE TRACER TESTS,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,AQUIFER PARAMETERS,STREAM,CALIBRATION,DENITRIFICATION,SYSTEMS",,"New Mexico State Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA"

Because previous measurements of nitrogen fixation, mineralization, and deposition can only account for approximately 26% of these communities' nitrogen requirements, other mechanisms of nitrogen supply should be operating. This study examined the potential for Subsurface hydrology to supply nitrogen to the rooting zones of early Successional plant communities. Three transects of ground water wells were established along the floodplain, and hydrologic characteristics and soil/water chemistry were measured for 2 y. Hydrologic measurements were then used to model the potential nitrogen contributions from advective flow and capillary rise. Ion exchange membranes and stable isotope tracers were used to identify the use of hyporheic nitrogen by vegetation. Nitrogen accumulation on ion exchange membranes showed a large input of nitrogen during a period of high water in 2003. Plants showed uptake of hyporheic N-15-labelled nitrogen at 2 of 4 locations. Models of capillary rise and advective flow estimated that nitrogen supply from subsurface water equalled or exceeded total nitrogen supply from nitrogen mineralization and processes in controlling nutrient supply nitrogen fixation combined. These findings underscore the of hyporheic to early successional vegetation on the Tanana River floodplain.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000259841500011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bnitrogen%2Bavailability%2Bin%2Ba%2Bhigh-latitude%252C%2Bsemi-arid%2Bfloodplain%26rft.aufirst%3DNicholas%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DNJ%26rft.aulast%3DLisuzzo%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2980%252F15-3-2998%26rft.eissn%3D2376-7626%26rft.epage%3D376%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1195-6860%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D366-376%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D366%26rft.stitle%3DECOSCIENCE%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DLisuzzo%252C%2BNJ%26rft.au%3DKielland%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DJones%252C%2BJB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=ECOSCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2980/15-3-2998,"advective flow,capillary fringe,hyporheic,nitrogen,riparian,Tanana River","TANANA RIVER FLOODPLAIN,SOIL-NITROGEN,RIPARIAN VEGETATION,SUCCESSIONAL SOILS,NUTRIENT DYNAMICS,SEEDLING GROWTH,ARCTIC PLANTS,WATER-TABLE,ECOSYSTEMS,PATTERNS",,"Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA"
23,23,"Huang, ZH",Aug 2022 ,The Coupling Coordination Evolutionary Analysis of Tourism-Ecological Environment-Public Service for the Yellow River Basin of China,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"In the context of the global pandemic, the development of tourism in the Yellow River Basin is constrained by the dual mechanisms of the decline in the quality of public service and the deterioration of the ecological environment. In order to promote the high-quality development of the ecological environment in the Yellow River Basin, this paper studies the coordinated development of tourism, the ecological environment and public service in the Yellow River Basin by treating tourism, the ecological environment and public service as a whole. Based on the coupling coordination function GM (1,1) grey prediction method and PVAR model, we discuss the characteristics of spatio-temporal differences, evolutionary trends and the interaction mechanism of the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of tourism-ecological environment-public service in nine provinces along the Yellow River Basin in China from 2008 to 2019. The results show that tourism and public service in the Yellow River Basin are closely related, and the protection of the ecological environment and tourism development are not contradictory. In terms of time, the overall trend is stable and upward from the perspective of the CCD of the three systems; in terms of space, Henan, Shandong, and Sichuan provinces have a relatively high level of CCD. While Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces have a lower level of CCD, which shows an upward trend from upstream to downstream in the space. The evolutionary trend of the CCD of the three systems in the basin will be upward in all provinces except for the Shandong province in the next five years. Tourism can promote both the ecological environment and public service from the perspective of the mutual influence mechanism.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000838873500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B9315%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BCoupling%2BCoordination%2BEvolutionary%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BTourism-Ecological%2BEnvironment-Public%2BService%2Bfor%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BBasin%2Bof%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DZhenhui%26rft.auinit%3DZH%26rft.aulast%3DHuang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph19159315%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D15%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BZH%26rft.au%3DWei%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DTang%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/ijerph19159315,"tourism,ecological environment,public service,Yellow River Basin,coupling coordination degree","URBAN AGGLOMERATIONS,SOURCE REGION,URBANIZATION,QUALITY,ECONOMY,DEGRADATION,REACHES",,"Zhengzhou Univ, Ctr Energy Environm & Econ Res, Sch Management, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China"

Such systems rely heavily on onboard sensors such as cameras, radar/LIDAR, and GPS as well as capabilities such as 3G/4G connectivity and V2V/V2I communication to make real-time maneuvering decisions. Autonomous vehicle control imposes very strict requirements on the security of the communication channels used by the vehicle to exchange information as well as the control logic that performs complex driving tasks such as adapting vehicle velocity or changing lanes. This study presents a first look at the effects of security attacks on the communication channel as well as sensor tampering of a connected vehicle stream equipped to achieve CACC. Our simulation results show that an insider attack can cause significant instability in the CACC vehicle stream. We also illustrate how different countermeasures, such as downgrading to ACC mode, could potentially be used to improve the security and safety of the connected vehicle streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000356157000020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSecurity%2BVulnerabilities%2Bof%2BConnected%2BVehicle%2BStreams%2Band%2BTheir%2BImpact%2Bon%2BCooperative%2BDriving%26rft.aufirst%3DMani%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DAmoozadeh%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FMCOM.2015.7120028%26rft.eissn%3D1558-1896%26rft.epage%3D132%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0163-6804%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%2BMAGAZINE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D126-132%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D126%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BCOMMUN%2BMAG%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DAmoozadeh%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DRaghuramu%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DLevitt%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=IEEE+COMMUNICATIONS+MAGAZINE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/MCOM.2015.7120028,,,,"Univ Calif Davis, ECE Dept, Davis, CA 95616 USA"
25,25,"D'Haen, K",Sep 1 2013 ,A sediment fingerprinting approach to understand the geomorphic coupling in an eastern Mediterranean mountainous river catchment,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"To understand the response of a river to anthropogenic disturbance, knowledge of the links between erosion, sediment deposition, and sediment export is crucial. Therefore, starting from field observations and connectivity proxies, a sediment fingerprinting approach using geochemical tracers was used to elucidate the subrecent sediment dynamics in the 264-km(2) Bugduz River catchment in SW Turkey. A topography-based connectivity index was used as a proxy for hillslope-channel coupling and stream power estimations as a proxy for the within-channel connectivity. Quantitative provenance information provides a link between potential sediment sources and the derived sediment currently stored within the fluvial system. Provenance signals from both contemporary river bed sediments (n = 144) and subrecent floodplain deposits (n = 28) provide more insight into the coupling of the hillslopes to the river channel and the coupling within the river channel itself. Furthermore, comparing the provenance signal with the areal extent of potential sediment sources upstream in the form of enrichment ratios sheds light upon the variation of the erodibility of the sources and the connectivity within the catchment. Results indicate that the valley gradient exerts an important control on the spatial variability of geomorphic coupling in the Bugduz catchment. Furthermore, different sediment sources (lithologies) show distinct sediment production rates. In addition to the observed spatial variability, coupling relations are characterized by an important seasonal variation, indicated by variable contributions of local and more distant sediment sources.

A large data set of river and riverbed temperature profiles from the Aa River in Belgium has been used to examine the spatial-temporal variations of groundwater/surface-water interaction. Exchange fluxes were calculated with the numerical heat-transport code STRIVE. The code was applied in transient mode to overcome previous limitations of steady-state analysis, and allowed for the calculation of model quality. In autumn and winter the mean exchange fluxes reached -90 mm d(-1), while in spring and early summer fluxes were -42 mm d(-1). Predominantly gaining conditions occurred along the river reach; however, in a few areas the direction of flow changed in time. The river banks showed elevated fluxes up to a factor of 3 compared to the center of the river. Higher fluxes were detected in the upstream section of the reach. Due to the influence of exchange fluxes along the river banks, larger temporal variations were found in the downstream section. The exchange fluxes at the river banks seemed more driven by variable local exchange flows, while the center of the river was dominated by deep and steady regional groundwater flows. These spatial and temporal differences in groundwater/surface-water exchange show the importance of long-term investigations on the driving forces of hyporheic processes across different scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000430538700012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDelineation%2Bof%2Bspatial-temporal%2Bpatterns%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%252Fsurface-water%2Binteraction%2Balong%2Ba%2Briver%2Breach%2B%2528Aa%2BRiver%252C%2BBelgium%2529%2Bwith%2Btransient%2Bthermal%2Bmodeling%26rft.aufirst%3DChristian%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DAnibas%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-017-1695-9%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D835%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D819-835%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D819%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D26%26rft.au%3DAnibas%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DTolche%252C%2BAD%26rft.au%3DBatelaan%252C%2BO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-017-1695-9,"Groundwater/surface-water relations,Thermal conditions,Inverse modeling,Heterogeneity,Belgium","TEMPERATURE TIME-SERIES,SURFACE-WATER,STREAMBED TEMPERATURES,HYPORHEIC ZONES,GROUND-WATER,HEAT,TRACER,FLOW,EXCHANGE,HETEROGENEITY",,"Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Hydrol & Hydraul Engn, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium"
27,27,"Meier, W",Aug 2003 ,Modeling the effect of water diversion on the temperature of mountain streams,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Water diversion for hydroelectric power generation impacts the temperature of mountain streams. Such changes are estimated by using a coupled one-dimensional dead-zone heat balance model. In very steep river sections, the dissipation of kinetic energy is the dominant heat source. For such streams, water diversion has only a minor effect on water temperature, because dissipation-induced temperature changes are independent of discharge. In contrast, in river sections of gradual slope, the influence by solar radiation, long-wave radiation. and heat exchange with the streambed is stronger. In such cases, a discharge reduction can lead to significant temperature changes. For a small stream in the southern Swiss Alps, model results show that diversion increases temperature by about 3.7 (+/-0.9)degreesC in a 21 km long river section under high solar radiation during summer. During a cold winter episode, water temperature is estimated to be about 1.8 (+/-0.8)degreesC lower compared to natural conditions. This heat balance model can also be used to simulate the effect of different measures to reduce water temperature changes in affected streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000184292900012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bthe%2Beffect%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bdiversion%2Bon%2Bthe%2Btemperature%2Bof%2Bmountain%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DW%26rft.auinit%3DW%26rft.aulast%3DMeier%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9372%25282003%2529129%253A8%2528755%2529%26rft.epage%3D764%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9372%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BENGINEERING-ASCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D755-764%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D755%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BENG-ASCE%26rft.volume%3D129%26rft.au%3DMeier%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DBonjour%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DReichert%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+ENGINEERING-ASCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2003)129:8(755),"mountain streams,water temperature,heat balance,hydroelectric power",,,"Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich ETHZ, Ueberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland"

Observing exchange flow behavior in heterogeneous systems is a primary challenge, particularly when flows are governed by dynamic river stage or tidal variations. In this paper we demonstrate a novel application of time-lapse 3D electrical resistivity tomography and temperature monitoring where an array of thermistors installed beneath a riverbed double as resistivity electrodes. We use the array to monitor stage driven exchange flows over a 6-day period in a dynamic, stage-driven high order stream. We present a method for addressing the otherwise confounding effects of the moving river-surface boundary on the raw resistivity data, thereby enabling successful tomographic imaging. Temperature time-series at each thermistor location and time-lapse 3D images of changes in bulk electrical conductivity together provide a detailed description of exchange dynamics over a 10-meter by 45-meter section of the riverbed, to a depth of approximately 5 m. Results reveal highly variable flux behavior throughout the monitoring domain including both horizontal and vertical exchange flows.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000813003800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B910058%26rft.atitle%3DRiverbed%2BTemperature%2Band%2B4D%2BERT%2BMonitoring%2BReveals%2BHeterogenous%2BHorizontal%2Band%2BVertical%2BGroundwater-Surface%2BWater%2BExchange%2BFlows%2BUnder%2BDynamic%2BStage%2BConditions%26rft.aufirst%3DTim%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DJohnson%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffeart.2022.910058%26rft.eissn%3D2296-6463%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BEARTH%2BSC-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DJohnson%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DThomle%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DStegen%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+EARTH+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/feart.2022.910058,"groundwater,surface water,hyporheic,resistivity,tomography,monitoring,temperature","HYPORHEIC ZONE,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,INTRUSION,TRANSPORT,ECOLOGY,AQUIFER,STREAM,EMERGENCE,INVERSION,SCIENCE",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99354 USA"
29,29,"Yu, X",Oct 7 2022 ,Study on coupling coordination of the human settlement environment and tourism industry in the yellow river basin,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"The human settlement environment is the basic space where people live, produce and live. The tourism industry is one of the industries closest to the development goal of the human settlement environment. The coordinated development of the human settlement environment and the tourism industry provides vital support for high-quality sustainable development in the region, but the related research is relatively insufficient. Based on the panel data from 2010 to 2019, this study takes the Yellow Basin as the research object, using comprehensive evaluation, coupling degree, and coupling coordination models. The study aims to comprehensively measure the development level of the human settlement environment and tourism industry in nine provinces of the Yellow River Basin and analyzes the spatio-temporal differentiation characteristics of the coupling coordination between the human settlement environment and tourism industry in the Yellow River Basin. The results demonstrate an interactive coupling relationship between the human settlement environment and the tourism industry. We observe an upward fluctuation in the development level of the two systems in the Yellow River Basin and converging development trends between the two; however, the tourism industry in the region is far behind in driving the construction of the human settlement environment. Regarding the spatial and temporal evolution of the coupling coordination of the two systems, in the time dimension, the coupling degree of the nine provinces in the Yellow River Basin was relatively stable from 2010 to 2019 and maintained a high level. The coupling coordination degree was on the rise, evolving from near-disorder to elementary coordination. The two systems in the Basin still showed a pattern of ""high coupling-low coordination. "" Nevertheless, in the spatial dimension, the coupling and coupling coordination degrees of the two systems in the Yellow River Basin showed an unbalanced development pattern of ""high in the southeast and low in the northwest. "" The regions with a low coordination level demonstrated that the development of the tourism industry lags behind in the construction of the human settlement environment. Findings in this study provide references for increasing the resonance between the human settlement environment and the tourism industry and promoting the overall coordinated, balanced and sustainable development of the Yellow River Basin.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000875660100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1016839%26rft.atitle%3DStudy%2Bon%2Bcoupling%2Bcoordination%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhuman%2Bsettlement%2Benvironment%2Band%2Btourism%2Bindustry%2Bin%2Bthe%2Byellow%2Briver%2Bbasin%26rft.aufirst%3DXiao%26rft.auinit%3DX%26rft.aulast%3DYu%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffenvs.2022.1016839%26rft.eissn%3D2296-665X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BENV%2BSCI-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DYu%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BHX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/fenvs.2022.1016839,"human settlement environment,tourism industry,coupling coordination,spatiotemporal differentiation,yellow river basin","URBAN LIVABILITY,CITY,QUALITY,DETERMINANTS,INDICATORS,ECONOMY,SERVICE,IMPACT",,"Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China"

The viability of eggs depends on many factors, particularly their oxygenation. Because dissolved oxygen is typically saturated within the stream channel, the dissolved oxygen distribution within the redd depends on whether or not hyporheic flow and transport occur within the sediment. We conducted a series of flume and numerical flow and age transport modeling experiments with the aim of understanding the effects of salmonid redds on the hyporheic transport of young oxygenated water. Hyporheic flow was visualized directly through dye injections. Dissolved oxygen throughout the fish nest was measured using a planar optode. Experiments were conducted at various open channel flow velocities in order to understand their effect on dissolved oxygen, and computational simulations considered various sediment textures and ambient groundwater upwelling rates to add process-level insight. We found that, as also shown by previous studies, the redd topography induces multiscale hyporheic flow that effectively flushes the egg pocket location with younger presumably oxygenated water; older water upwells and forms anoxic zones. This pattern persists even at the lowest channel flow rates and at small upwelling velocities of older ambient groundwater which splits the multiscale hyporheic flow cells into isolated pockets. Large groundwater upwelling rates can shut down all the hyporheic flushing. The relatively coarse texture of the redd further promotes hyporheic flushing of the redd sediment with oxygenated water. Thus, redd morphology and sediment texture optimally combine to induce hyporheic exchange flow that delivers young oxygenated water to the egg pocket.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000393134800015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bflow%2Band%2Bdissolved%2Boxygen%2Bdistribution%2Bin%2Bfish%2Bnests%253A%2BThe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bopen%2Bchannel%2Bvelocity%252C%2Bpermeability%2Bpatterns%252C%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bupwelling%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BBayani%26rft.auinit%3DMB%26rft.aulast%3DCardenas%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016JG003381%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D3130%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3113-3130%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3113%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D121%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DFord%252C%2BAE%26rft.au%3DCook%252C%2BPLM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016JG003381,,"PORE-WATER EXCHANGE,EGG BURIAL DEPTHS,SPAWNING HABITAT,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,EMBRYO SURVIVAL,RIVER,DYNAMICS,SEDIMENT,STREAM,DENITRIFICATION",,"Univ Texas Austin, Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA"

In this study, the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and Darcian flux in a submerged streambed and its adjacent exposed stream banks were investigated in the Beiluo River, northwest China. In the submerged streambed, Darcian flux was estimated by measurement of vertical hydraulic conductivity (K (v)) and vertical head gradient (VHG) using in-situ permeameter tests. On exposed stream banks, both horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K (h)) and K (v) were measured by on-site permeameter tests. In the submerged streambed, K (v) values gradually decreased with depth and the higher values were concentrated in the center and close to the erosional bank. Compared to the exposed stream banks, the K (v) values were higher in the streambed. From stream stage to the topmost layer of tested sediment, through increasing elevation, the K (h) values increased on the erosional bank, while they decreased on the depositional bank. The values of VHG along the thalweg illustrate that downwelling flux occurred in the deepest area while upwelling flux appeared in the other areas, which might result from the change of streambed elevation. The higher value of the Darcian flux in the submerged streambed existed near the erosional bank.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000389242800010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHeterogeneity%2Bof%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Band%2BDarcian%2Bflux%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bsubmerged%2Bstreambed%2Band%2Badjacent%2Bexposed%2Bstream%2Bbank%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBeiluo%2BRiver%252C%2Bnorthwest%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DJinxi%26rft.auinit%3DJX%26rft.aulast%3DSong%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-016-1449-0%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D2062%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2049-2062%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2049%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BWW%26rft.au%3DLong%252C%2BYQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-016-1449-0,"Hydraulic properties,Vertical head gradient,Streambed,Groundwater/surface-water relations,China","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,VARIABILITY,PATTERNS,SYSTEM,IMPACT,LAYERS,FLOW",,"Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Peoples R China"
32,32,"Woessner, WW",May-jun 2000 ,Stream and fluvial plain ground water interactions: Rescaling hydrogeologic thought,GROUND WATER,"Management of near-channel ground water and surface water to maintain stream health and floodplain ecological function requires hydrogeologists to refocus their conceptual models of water exchange between the aquifer and stream. The high hydraulic conductivity fluvial plain directs ground water flow down-plain where it exchanges with the stream channel creating gaining, losing, flow-through, and parallel-flow reaches. The resulting complex flow system requires consideration when profiles representing ground water flowpaths are constructed. In addition to interaction at the scale of the fluvial plain, exchange of ground mater and surface water within and immediately adjacent to the stream channel creates hyporheic zones. The physical and biogeochemical extent of these zones depends on the head distribution and ground water flow directions, stream hydraulics, and channel bed conditions, and magnitudes and distributions of hydrogeologic parameters. Simulated conceptualizations of flow dynamics caused by slight increases in hydraulic potentials at the surface water-stream bed interface indicate stream-ground water mixing could occur to a depth of 1.7 m below the channel. Rescaling of traditional hydrogeologic approaches to include the fluvial plain and channel scale will result in opportunities to expand hydrogeologic research and participate in interdisciplinary research teams attempting to decipher and manage fluvial systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000087761300019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStream%2Band%2Bfluvial%2Bplain%2Bground%2Bwater%2Binteractions%253A%2BRescaling%2Bhydrogeologic%2Bthought%26rft.aufirst%3DWW%26rft.auinit%3DWW%26rft.aulast%3DWoessner%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1745-6584.2000.tb00228.x%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D429%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D423-429%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D423%26rft.stitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D38&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=GROUND+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1745-6584.2000.tb00228.x,,"HYPORHEIC ZONE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,SURFACE-WATER,INTEGRATING HYDROLOGY,AQUIFER SYSTEMS,EXCHANGE,RIVER,PERSPECTIVE",,"Univ Montana, Dept Geol, Missoula, MT 59812 USA"

In this paper, a new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity evaluation index system is established to evaluate the new urbanization level and ecological carrying capacity of the Yellow River Basin. On this basis, the uncoordinated coupling level of new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity in the Yellow River Basin is measured by using the improved uncoordinated coupling model, and its temporal and spatial characteristics and internal impact mechanism are analyzed. The study shows that the new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity of the Yellow River Basin has a benign development trend as a whole. Shandong province belongs to the low-level uncoordinated coupling type; Gansu Province and Qinghai Province belong to the running-in uncoordinated type; and Shanxi Province, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shaanxi Province, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region belong to the antagonistic uncoordinated coupling type. The uncoordinated coupling degree between new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity in the Yellow River Basin has a spatial interaction effect. It presents a low-level cluster centered on Shaanxi Province and Shandong Province and a high-level cluster centered on Gansu Province, Qinghai Province, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. From the perspective of the internal main impact mechanism, water resources have a two-way impact on the development of the two systems of new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity; the number of permanent residents and the level of scientific and technological investment have a one-way impact on the process of new urbanization; and the green coverage rate of built-up areas has a one-way impact on the development of ecological carrying capacity. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the evaluation index system of new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity has been improved in combination with the new development concept. The evaluation of new urbanization by this index system is more in line with the current national requirements for high-quality development. Second, the impact of potential resources and human regulation has been added to the traditional ecological carrying capacity evaluation index system, and the evaluation of ecological carrying capacity by this index system is more in line with reality. Thirdly, taking the time effect into account, an improved uncoordinated coupling method is proposed. Using this method to evaluate the relationship between systems is conducive to bringing the dynamic relationship within the system into the evaluation system, which is more in line with the reality of system changes. Fourth, from the perspective of problem diagnosis, research on the relationship between new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity will help to find the internal mechanism that affects the coordinated development of new urbanization and ecological carrying capacity in the Yellow River Basin. This method is universal for exploring the internal influence mechanism of the relationship between systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000838956700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B9016%26rft.atitle%3DUncoordinated%2BCoupling%2BAssessment%2Bof%2BNew%2BUrbanization%2Band%2BEcological%2BCarrying%2BCapacity%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BBasin%26rft.aufirst%3DDongmin%26rft.auinit%3DDM%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph19159016%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D15%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DZhu%252C%2BLB%26rft.au%3DCui%252C%2BHW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/ijerph19159016,"Yellow River Basin,new urbanization,ecological carrying capacity,non-coordinated coupling","COORDINATION,ENVIRONMENT,PROVINCE",,"Jilin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Jingyue St 3699, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China"
34,34,"Czuba, JA",Mar 2019 ,Dynamics of Surface-Water Connectivity in a Low-Gradient Meandering River Floodplain,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"High-resolution topography reveals that floodplains along meandering rivers in Indiana commonly contain intermittently flowing channel networks. We investigated how the presence of floodplain channels affects lateral surface-water connectivity between a river and floodplain (specifically exchange flux and timescales of transport) as a function of flow stage in a low-gradient river-floodplain system. We constructed a two-dimensional, surface-water hydrodynamic model using Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) 2D along 32km of floodplain (56km along the river) of the East Fork White River near Seymour, Indiana, USA, using lidar elevation data and surveyed river bathymetry. The model was calibrated using land-cover specific roughness to elevation-discharge data from a U.S. Geological Survey gage and validated against high-water marks, an aerial photo showing the spatial extent of floodplain inundation, and measured flow velocities. Using the model results, we analyzed the flow in the river, spatial patterns of inundation, flow pathways, river-floodplain exchange, and water residence time on the floodplain. Our results highlight that bankfull flow is an oversimplified concept for explaining river-floodplain connectivity because some stream banks are overtopped and major low-lying floodplain channels are inundated roughly 19days per year. As flow increased, inundation of floodplain channels at higher elevations dissected the floodplain, until the floodplain channels became fully inundated. Additionally, we found that river-floodplain exchange was driven by bank height or channel orientation depending on flow conditions.

35,35,"Habberfield, MW",Aug 2014 ,RAPID GEOMORPHIC AND HABITAT STREAM ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES INFORM RESTORATION DIFFERENTLY BASED ON LEVELS OF STREAM DISTURBANCE,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Visual-based rapid assessment techniques provide an efficient method for characterizing the restoration potential of streams, with many focusing on channel stability and instream habitat features. Few studies, however, have compared these techniques to see if they result in differing restoration priorities. Three rapid assessment techniques were contrasted at three wild trout streams in western New York with different amounts of channel disturbance. Two methods focused only on geomorphic stability, whereas the third addressed physical habitat condition. Habitat assessment scores were not correlated with scores for either geomorphic assessment method and they varied more between channels with different degrees of disturbance. A model based on dynamic equilibrium concepts best explains the variation among the streams and techniques because it accounts for a stream's capacity to maintain ecological integrity despite some inherent instability. Geomorphic indices can serve as effective proxies for biological indices in highly disturbed systems. Yet, this may not be the case in less disturbed systems, where geomorphic indices cannot differentiate channel adjustments that impact biota from those that do not. Dynamically stable streams can include both stable and unstable reaches locally as characterized by geomorphic methods and translating these results into restoration priorities may not be appropriate if interpretations are limited to the reach scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000340464800015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRAPID%2BGEOMORPHIC%2BAND%2BHABITAT%2BSTREAM%2BASSESSMENT%2BTECHNIQUES%2BINFORM%2BRESTORATION%2BDIFFERENTLY%2BBASED%2BON%2BLEVELS%2BOF%2BSTREAM%2BDISTURBANCE%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DMW%26rft.aulast%3DHabberfield%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fjawr.12156%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D1062%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1051-1062%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1051%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DHabberfield%252C%2BMW%26rft.au%3DBlersch%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DAtkinson%252C%2BJF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/jawr.12156,"biotic integrity,rivers/streams,fluvial processes,monitoring,restoration,watershed management,geomorphology","RIVER RESTORATION,ECOLOGY,PROJECT",,"SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geog, 202 Jarvis Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA"
36,36,"Ruhala, SS",Jan 2018 ,"Exploring dissolved organic carbon cycling at the stream-groundwater interface across a third-order, lowland stream network",BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"The stream-groundwater interface (SGI) is thought to be an important location within stream networks for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) processing (e.g., degradation, removal), since it is considered a hotspot for microbial activity and biogeochemical reactions. This research is one of the first attempts to collect and assess DOC conditions at the SGI across a stream network-an entire third-order, lowland watershed in Michigan, USA. We present an initial exploration of this unique data set and highlight some of the challenges when working at these scales. Overall, our results show that SGI DOC conditions are complex at the network scale and do not conform to predictions based upon previous point- and small-scale studies. We found no strong pattern of DOC removal within the SGI at the network scale even after using chloride and temperature as natural tracers to differentiate between hydrological processes and biogeochemical reactions influencing DOC cycling. Instead, trends in DOC quantity and molecular qualities suggest that potential biotic reactions, including aerobic microbial respiration, had an influence on DOC concentrations at only some of the sites, while physical mixing of ground and stream surface waters appears to explain the majority of the observed changes in DOC concentrations at other sites. In addition, results show that neither SGI sites indicating DOC removal nor DOC molecular quality shifts measured correlated with stream order. It did reveal that DOC variability across surface water, groundwater, and the SGI locations was consistently greatest in the shallow sediments of the SGI, demonstrating that the SGI is a systematically distinct location for DOC conditions in the watershed. Our empirical stream network-scale SGI data are some of the first that are compatible with recently developed process-based, network-scale, SGI models. Our results indicate that these process-based models may not accurately represent SGI exchange of lowland, groundwater discharge-dominated streams like the one in this study. Lastly, this study shows that new methods are needed to achieve the goal of making and linking SGI observations to network-scale biogeochemical processes and theory. To help develop these methods we provide a discussion of the approach we used (i.e., ""lessons-learned"") that might become the basis for systematic data analysis of SGI porewaters in future, network-wide biogeochemical studies of the SGI.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000423362600007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExploring%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bcycling%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bstream-groundwater%2Binterface%2Bacross%2Ba%2Bthird-order%252C%2Blowland%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%26rft.aufirst%3DSydney%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DSS%26rft.aulast%3DRuhala%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-017-0404-z%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D126%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D105-126%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D105%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D137%26rft.au%3DRuhala%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DWiewiora%252C%2BER&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10533-017-0404-z,"DOC,Stream-groundwater interactions,Network scale,Streams,Stream carbon cycling","HYPORHEIC ZONE,RIVER NETWORK,MASS-BALANCE,ECOSYSTEMS,METABOLISM,DYNAMICS,EXCHANGE,MATTER,DENITRIFICATION,RETENTION",,"Michigan State Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 288 Farm Lane,Nat Sci Bldg,Room 207, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA"

38,38,"McKnight, DM",Aug 2015 ,Potential for real-time understanding of coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in stream ecosystems: Future integration of telemetered data with process models for glacial meltwater streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"While continuous monitoring of streamflow and temperature has been common for some time, there is great potential to expand continuous monitoring to include water quality parameters such as nutrients, turbidity, oxygen, and dissolved organic material. In many systems, distinguishing between watershed and stream ecosystem controls can be challenging. The usefulness of such monitoring can be enhanced by the application of quantitative models to interpret observed patterns in real time. Examples are discussed primarily from the glacial meltwater streams of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Although the Dry Valley landscape is barren of plants, many streams harbor thriving cyanobacterial mats. Whereas a daily cycle of streamflow is controlled by the surface energy balance on the glaciers and the temporal pattern of solar exposure, the daily signal for biogeochemical processes controlling water quality is generated along the stream. These features result in an excellent outdoor laboratory for investigating fundamental ecosystem process and the development and validation of process-based models. As part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research project, we have conducted field experiments and developed coupled biogeochemical transport models for the role of hyporheic exchange in controlling weathering reactions, microbial nitrogen cycling, and stream temperature regulation. We have adapted modeling approaches from sediment transport to understand mobilization of stream biomass with increasing flows. These models help to elucidate the role of in-stream processes in systems where watershed processes also contribute to observed patterns, and may serve as a test case for applying real-time stream ecosystem models.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000363402800045,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPotential%2Bfor%2Breal-time%2Bunderstanding%2Bof%2Bcoupled%2Bhydrologic%2Band%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Bstream%2Becosystems%253A%2BFuture%2Bintegration%2Bof%2Btelemetered%2Bdata%2Bwith%2Bprocess%2Bmodels%2Bfor%2Bglacial%2Bmeltwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DDiane%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DDM%26rft.aulast%3DMcKnight%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017618%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6738%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6725-6738%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6725%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DCozzetto%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DWlostowski%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015WR017618,,"MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS,ACID-MINE DRAINAGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,WATER CHEMISTRY,DIDYMOSPHENIA,TERRESTRIAL,ANTARCTICA,PERIPHYTON,NETWORKS,COLORADO",,"Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA"

Given the implications of climate warming for stream thermal regimes, it is an important consideration in river management plans. Energy exchanges at the water-air interface, channel geomorphology, riparian vegetation and advective heat transport from the different sources of discharge can all influence stream temperature. A simple mixing equation was used to investigate heat transport and to estimate daily mean and maximum stream temperatures on the basis of mixing groundwater and near-surface flows from riparian wetlands as end-members in a peatland catchment. The resulting data were evaluated against energy balance components and saturation extent to investigate the importance of riparian wetlands in determining stream temperatures. Data fit was generally good in periods with extensive saturation and poorest in dry periods with less hydrological connectivity, when reduced saturation and low flows increased the relative influence of energy exchange at the stream-atmosphere interface. These findings have implications in terms of climate change and land management, where the planting of riparian buffer strips to moderate water temperatures may be less effective when saturation area is extensive and hydrological connectivity is high.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000452409900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRole%2Bof%2Briparian%2Bwetlands%2Band%2Bhydrological%2Bconnectivity%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bthermal%2Bregimes%26rft.aufirst%3DJonathan%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DJJ%26rft.aulast%3DDick%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fnh.2017.066%26rft.eissn%3D2224-7955%26rft.epage%3D647%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-1277%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D634-647%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D634%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DDick%252C%2BJJ%26rft.au%3DTetzlaff%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DSoulsby%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/nh.2017.066,"mixing models,peatlands,riparian areas,stream temperatures","WATER-QUALITY,HYDROGRAPH SEPARATIONS,HEADWATER STREAMS,STORAGE DYNAMICS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,TEMPERATURE,GROUNDWATER,RIVER,RUNOFF,MODEL",,"Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Elphinstone Rd, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland"
40,40,"Rozon, RM",Dec 2018 ,It goes with the flow: Size mediated plankton attenuation through the Niagara River connecting channel,JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,"The Niagara River connecting channel provides a unique system in which to examine the impact of a rapid lentic-lotic-lentic transition on a freshwater ecosystem, particularly on plankton community composition. From June to October 2014, six monitoring sites (three in the upper river and three in the lower river) were sampled monthly for water chemistry, phytoplankton and/or zooplankton composition. Zooplankton biomass decreased exponentially with distance downstream, as expected within a high flow lotic environment. The rapid attenuation of zooplankton occurring within 10 km of the river mouth was likely due to predation by large populations of planktivorous fishes in the river. Densities of phytoplankton, rotifers and bacteria also declined but were less strongly impacted by the lentic-lotic transition. Plankton communities were dominated by species common to Lake Erie, the source waterbody, and also by taxa more resilient to the highly turbulent conditions of the river. These species included siliceous diatoms, filamentous algae, small zooplankters, dreissenid veligers and loricated rotifers. Furthermore, the seasonality of species composition in the Niagara River is the same as its source water body, suggesting no impact from the river on plankton succession. Niagara Falls and the two hydroelectric facilities were not found to be a significant cause of plankton mortality down river. There is some evidence however that entrainment time in the hydroelectric reservoirs may slightly enhance phytoplankton and zooplankton densities, thus contributing to plankton populations downstream of the turbine discharges.

41,41,"Alexander, RB",Feb 2007 ,The role of headwater streams in downstream water quality,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Knowledge of headwater influences on the water-quality and flow conditions of downstream waters is essential to water-resource management at all governmental levels; this includes recent court decisions on the jurisdiction of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) over upland areas that contribute to larger downstream water bodies. We review current watershed research and use a water-quality model to investigate headwater influences on downstream receiving waters. Our evaluations demonstrate the intrinsic connections of headwaters to landscape processes and downstream waters through their influence on the supply, transport, and fate of water and solutes in watersheds. Hydrological processes in headwater catchments control the recharge of subsurface water stores, flow paths, and residence times of water throughout landscapes. The dynamic coupling of hydrological and biogeochemical. processes in upland streams further controls the chemical form, timing, and longitudinal distances of solute transport to downstream waters. We apply the spatially explicit, mass-balance watershed model SPARROW to consider transport and transformations of water and nutrients throughout stream networks in the northeastern United States. We simulate fluxes of nitrogen, a primary nutrient that is a water-quality concern for acidification of streams and lakes and eutrophication of coastal waters, and refine the model structure to include literature observations of nitrogen removal in streams and lakes. We quantify nitrogen transport from headwaters to downstream navigable waters, where headwaters are defined within the model as first-order, perennial streams that include flow and nitrogen contributions from smaller, intermittent and ephemeral streams. We find that first-order headwaters contribute approximately 70% of the mean-annual water volume and 65% of the nitrogen flux in second-order streams.

We used MODFLOW and SEAM3D to simulate hyporheic flow cells induced by riverbed dunes and upwelling groundwater together with mixing-dependent denitrification of an upwelling nitrate (NO3-) plume. Our base case modeled labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) advecting from surface water, and DO and NO3- advecting from groundwater, typical of certain agricultural areas. We conducted sensitivity analyses that showed mixing-dependent denitrification in the hyporheic zone increased with increasing hydraulic conductivity (K), decreasing lower boundary flux, and increasing DOC in surface water or NO3- in groundwater. Surface water DOC, groundwater NO3-, and K were the most sensitive parameters affecting mixing-dependent denitrification. Nonmixing-dependent denitrification also occurred when there was surface water NO3-, and its magnitude was often greater than mixing-dependent denitrification. Nevertheless, mixing-dependent reactions provide functions that nonmixing-dependent reactions cannot, with potential for hyporheic zones to attenuate upwelling NO3- plumes, depending on geomorphic, hydraulic, and biogeochemical conditions. Stream and river restoration efforts may be able to increase mixing-dependent reactions by promoting natural processes that promote bedform creation and augment labile carbon sources.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000346654600037,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DControls%2Bon%2Bmixing-dependent%2Bdenitrification%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%2Binduced%2Bby%2Briverbed%2Bdunes%253A%2BA%2Bsteady%2Bstate%2Bmodeling%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DErich%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR015424%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D9066%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D9048-9066%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D9048%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DYoung%252C%2BKI%26rft.au%3DWiddowson%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014WR015424,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,CONTAMINATED STREAM,RIPARIAN ZONE,GROUNDWATER,NITROGEN,WATER,EXCHANGE,NITRATE",,"Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"

44,44,"Cheong, TS",Jul 2007 ,Estimation of key parameters in model for solute transport in rivers and streams,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"The exchange mechanisms associated with transient storage zones of a natural heterogeneous environment are often modified by unsteady water flux in the transient storage zone. This phenomenon can play an important role in the mass exchange between the free flowing water zone and the transient storage zones and may be the cause of the plateau region of the tail of observed concentration curves in natural streams. Deterministic interpretation methods are often used to generate the shape of the solute concentration curves in natural streams based on representations of transient storage exchange. Although many models are available to predict the parameters for the deterministic interpretation method, none can be used with confidence unless previously calibrated in the particular river reach under consideration. Therefore, the availability of reliable means for the provision of these parameters is usually the primary difficulty in the prediction of the rate of movement, dilution, and mixing of solute in rivers and streams. Measured tracer-response curves produced from the injection of a known quantity of soluble tracer provide one means for obtaining the requisite parameters. In this work, we advance an alternative approach based on the use of hydraulic and geometric information that are easily obtained in natural streams. Empirical equations used to predict the parameters are also analyzed to evaluate their behavior in representing solute mixing in natural streams with transient storage zones. Finally, the present proposals are validated against field meausrements of the solute concentration curves of chloride along a 1.2 km reach of the Shingobee River, Minnesota, U.S.A.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000247312200008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEstimation%2Bof%2Bkey%2Bparameters%2Bin%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bsolute%2Btransport%2Bin%2Brivers%2Band%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DTae%2BSung%26rft.auinit%3DTS%26rft.aulast%3DCheong%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-006-9074-7%26rft.epage%3D1186%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1165-1186%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1165%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DCheong%252C%2BTS%26rft.au%3DYounis%252C%2BBA%26rft.au%3DSeo%252C%2BIW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11269-006-9074-7,"mixing characteristics,transient storage zone model,parameter estimation,routing method","TRANSIENT STORAGE MODEL,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,ZONE MODEL,TRACER,FLOW,SIMULATION,RETENTION",,"Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA"
45,45,"Wollheim, WM",Jun 1999 ,A coupled field and modeling approach for the analysis of nitrogen cycling in streams,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The stable isotope stream tracer model (SISTM) calculates the expected N-15 content in various stream ecosystem N compartments over distance and time during and after N-15 additions to streams. SISTM is a steady state compartment model that predicts delta(15)N values based on N stocks and fluxes and the experimental rate of N-15 addition. Predicted delta(15)N values are compared with observed delta(15)N values from a field tracer addition to evaluate our understanding of the N cycle. We demonstrated the use of this tool with information collected from field measurements and a 6-wk N-15-NH4+ addition to the Kuparuk River, Alaska, during the summer of 1991. SISTM was used to run a series of model calibrations that reflected increased information as the experiment progressed. Results of an a priori calibration (using pre-1991 data) yielded a predicted NH4+ uptake length (S-w) of 5.2 km compared with the observed S-w of 0.84 km, and underestimated the delta(15)N values of biota in all cases. When discharge and NH4+ concentrations measured during the 1991 experiment were added (model calibration Update 1), the predicted S-w, dropped to 0.44 km, indicating that the modeled fluxes overestimated the rate of NH4+ removal by the stream bottom. Adding N stocks and fluxes measured during the tracer addition (Update 2) did not improve predicted S-w, indicating faulty assumptions in our a priori calibration. The observed isotope data were used to estimate the form (NH4+ vs NO3-) of N taken up by primary producers and to improve our representation of the epilithon compartment (Update 3). Including this information brought the predicted S-w to 0.71 km compared with the observed 0.84 km, and resulted in a reasonable correspondence between predicted and observed delta(15)N values over the 6-wk addition. SISTM can be used as a framework to 1) summarize N-cycle information prior to a tracer addition, 2) generate testable predictions for field isotope studies, 3) improve our understanding of the N cycle using the field isotope data as constraints on nw: estimates, and 4) explore hypothetical N-cycle characteristics. The combined modeling and field tracer experiment approach efficiently provided a synoptic view of the N cycle in streams and rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000081682400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bcoupled%2Bfield%2Band%2Bmodeling%2Bapproach%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Bnitrogen%2Bcycling%2Bin%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DWM%26rft.auinit%3DWM%26rft.aulast%3DWollheim%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468461%26rft.epage%3D221%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D199-221%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D199%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DWollheim%252C%2BWM%26rft.au%3DPeterson%252C%2BBJ%26rft.au%3DMiller%252C%2BMC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1468461,"N cycling,compartment model,tracer addition,stable isotope,N-15,uptake length,stream ecosystem","AMMONIA DIFFUSION METHOD,WOODLAND STREAM,TUNDRA STREAM,NUTRIENT LIMITATION,LEAF DECOMPOSITION,3RD-ORDER STREAM,STABLE ISOTOPES,UPTAKE KINETICS,FOREST STREAM,FRESH-WATERS",,"Marine Biol Lab, Ctr Ecosyst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA"
46,46,"Earon, R",Dec 2020 ,Insight into the influence of local streambed heterogeneity on hyporheic-zone flow characteristics,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Interaction between surface water and groundwater plays a fundamental role in influencing aquatic chemistry, where hyporheic exchange processes, distribution of flow paths and residence times within the hyporheic zone will influence the transport of mass and energy in the surface-water/groundwater system. Geomorphological conditions greatly influence hyporheic exchange, and heterogeneities such as rocks and clay lenses will be a key factor for delineating the hyporheic zone. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) were used to investigate the streambed along a 6.3-m-long reach in order to characterise geological layering and distinct features which may influence parameters such as hydraulic conductivity. Time-lapse ERT measurements taken during a tracer injection demonstrated that geological features at the meter-scale played a determining role for the hyporheic flow field. The penetration depth of the tracer into the streambed sediment displayed a variable spatial pattern in areas where the presence of highly resistive anomalies was detected. In areas with more homogeneous sediments, the penetration depth was much more uniformly distributed than observed in more heterogeneous sections, demonstrating that ERT can play a vital role in identifying critical hydraulic features that may influence hyporheic exchange processes. Reciprocal ERT measurements linked variability and thus uncertainty in the modelled resistivity to the spatial locations, which also demonstrated larger variability in the tracer penetration depth, likely due to local heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000574730400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInsight%2Binto%2Bthe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Blocal%2Bstreambed%2Bheterogeneity%2Bon%2Bhyporheic-zone%2Bflow%2Bcharacteristics%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DEaron%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-020-02244-5%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D2712%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2697-2712%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2697%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DEaron%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DRiml%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DOlofsson%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-020-02244-5,"Heterogeneity,Electrical resistivity tomography,Tracer tests,Groundwater,surface-water relations,Geophysical methods","ELECTRICAL-RESISTIVITY TOMOGRAPHY,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SPATIAL-PATTERNS,EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER,TRANSPORT,DISCHARGE,NITRATE,RIVER,SOIL",,"KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Teknikringen 10B, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden"
47,47,"Shamieh, F",Aug 2019 ,Dynamic Cross-Layer Signaling Exchange for Real-Time and On-Demand Multimedia Streams,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA,"Multimedia streams consume a significant chunk of the consumer Internet traffic exchanged and will continue to do so due to the ever-increasing connection among people, businesses, and industries. To cope with the deviation of the Internet's intended use, unreliable underlying infrastructure, and best effort protocols while leveraging existing technologies, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Adaptive Streaming is utilized by numerous multimedia services. Performance of HAS-based streaming services is limited by the growing control overhead generated by the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack as the stream length, multimedia fidelity, and network conditions vary. In this paper, a novel cross-layer steganographic-enabled signaling scheme is proposed to reduce service provider costs while improving multimedia session performance and maintaining expected Quality-of-Service (QoS). The proposed scheme is designed to encode control stream messages from any TCP/IP layer within payload messages to reduce the total amount of overhead exchanged, thereby decreasing resource utilization within source and intermediate nodes. Furthermore, the encoding scheme probes network conditions and session statistics for adaptive decision-making to enable real-time pliability of the proposed process. A utility function is developed to find the optimal cost savings where simulations are conducted to verify the designs. The proposed solution is then implemented using VideoLan Media Player transceivers residing in linux containers virtual machines, where a multimedia file is exchanged in the popular Advanced Video Coding (H. 264) format. The results show a decrease in bandwidth and average queue waiting time costs of 4.71% and 29.61%, respectively, with a throughput increase of 5.77%.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000476809700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDynamic%2BCross-Layer%2BSignaling%2BExchange%2Bfor%2BReal-Time%2Band%2BOn-Demand%2BMultimedia%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DFuad%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DShamieh%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTMM.2019.2892007%26rft.eissn%3D1941-0077%26rft.epage%3D1904%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1520-9210%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BMULTIMEDIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1893-1904%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1893%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BMULTIMEDIA%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DShamieh%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BXB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+MULTIMEDIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/TMM.2019.2892007,"Cost reduction,HTTP adaptive streaming,multimedia communication,quality of service,steganography",VIDEO,,"Univ Western Ontario, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada"
48,48,"Zhao, T",Feb 2017 ,Coupled DEM-CFD investigation on the formation of landslide dams in narrow rivers,LANDSLIDES,"Large-scale landslide dams can induce significant hazards to human lives by blocking the river flows and causing inundation upstream. They may trigger severe outburst flooding that may devastate downstream areas once failed. Thus, the advancement in understanding the formation of landslide dams is highly necessary. This paper presents 3D numerical investigations of the formation of landslide dams in open fluid channels via the discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). By employing this model, the influence of flow velocity on granular depositional morphology has been clarified. As the grains settle downwards in the fluid channel, positive excess water pressures are generated at the bottom region, reducing the total forces acting on the granular mass. In the meantime, the particle sedimentations into the fluid channel with high impacting velocities can generate fluid streams to flow backwards and forwards. The coupled hydraulic effects of excess water pressure and fluid flow would entrain the solid grains to move long distances along the channel. For simulations using different flow velocities, the larger the flow velocity is, the further distance the grains can be transported to. In this process, the solid grains move as a series of surges, with decreasing deposit lengths for the successive surges. The granular flux into the fluid channel has very little influence on the depositional pattern of particles, while it affects the particle-fluid interactions significantly. The results obtained from the DEM-CFD coupled simulations can reasonably explain the mechanisms of granular transportation and deposition in the formation of landslide dams in narrow rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000393643900013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2BDEM-CFD%2Binvestigation%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bformation%2Bof%2Blandslide%2Bdams%2Bin%2Bnarrow%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DTao%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DZhao%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10346-015-0675-1%26rft.eissn%3D1612-5118%26rft.epage%3D201%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1612-510X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DLANDSLIDES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D189-201%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D189%26rft.stitle%3DLANDSLIDES%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DDai%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BNW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=LANDSLIDES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10346-015-0675-1,"Landslide dams,DEM-CFD coupling,Granular transport,Fluid channel,Excess water pressure,Granular surges","FLUID-PARTICLE INTERACTION,GAS-SOLID FLOW,NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE,DISCRETE ELEMENT,SICHUAN PROVINCE,MODEL,MECHANICS,RAINFALL,MOTION",,"Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China"
49,49,"Turner, DP",Nov 2013 ,"A large proportion of North American net ecosystem production is offset by emissions from harvested products, river/stream evasion, and biomass burning",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Diagnostic carbon cycle models produce estimates of net ecosystem production (NEP, the balance of net primary production and heterotrophic respiration) by integrating information from (i) satellite-based observations of land surface vegetation characteristics; (ii) distributed meteorological data; and (iii) eddy covariance flux tower observations of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (used in model parameterization). However, a full bottom-up accounting of NEE (the vertical carbon flux) that is suitable for integration with atmosphere-based inversion modeling also includes emissions from decomposition/respiration of harvested forest and agricultural products, CO2 evasion from streams and rivers, and biomass burning. Here, we produce a daily time step NEE for North America for the year 2004 that includes NEP as well as the additional emissions. This NEE product was run in the forward mode through the CarbonTracker inversion setup to evaluate its consistency with CO2 concentration observations. The year 2004 was climatologically favorable for NEP over North America and the continental total was estimated at 1730 +/- 370TgCyr(-1) (a carbon sink). Harvested product emissions (316 +/- 80TgCyr(-1)), river/stream evasion (158 +/- 50TgCyr(-1)), and fire emissions (142 +/- 45TgCyr(-1)) counteracted a large proportion (35%) of the NEP sink. Geographic areas with strong carbon sinks included Midwest US croplands, and forested regions of the Northeast, Southeast, and Pacific Northwest. The forward mode run with CarbonTracker produced good agreement between observed and simulated wintertime CO2 concentrations aggregated over eight measurement sites around North America, but overestimates of summertime concentrations that suggested an underestimation of summertime carbon uptake. As terrestrial NEP is the dominant offset to fossil fuel emission over North America, a good understanding of its spatial and temporal variation - as well as the fate of the carbon it sequesters is needed for a comprehensive view of the carbon cycle.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000325567100024,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Blarge%2Bproportion%2Bof%2BNorth%2BAmerican%2Bnet%2Becosystem%2Bproduction%2Bis%2Boffset%2Bby%2Bemissions%2Bfrom%2Bharvested%2Bproducts%252C%2Briver%252Fstream%2Bevasion%252C%2Band%2Bbiomass%2Bburning%26rft.aufirst%3DDavid%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DDP%26rft.aulast%3DTurner%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgcb.12313%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2486%26rft.epage%3D3528%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1354-1013%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DGLOBAL%2BCHANGE%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3516-3528%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3516%26rft.stitle%3DGLOBAL%2BCHANGE%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DTurner%252C%2BDP%26rft.au%3DJacobson%252C%2BAR%26rft.au%3DNemani%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D711sZtB3x4uVyaANGCkZ1&SrcJTitle=GLOBAL+CHANGE+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gcb.12313,"atmospheric inversion model,biomass burning,carbon flux,net ecosystem exchange,net ecosystem production,river evasion","GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION,CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE,ATMOSPHERIC CO2,INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY,TERRESTRIAL GROSS,HIGH-RESOLUTION,FLUX TOWER,STAND AGE,FOREST,CLIMATE",,"Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA"
