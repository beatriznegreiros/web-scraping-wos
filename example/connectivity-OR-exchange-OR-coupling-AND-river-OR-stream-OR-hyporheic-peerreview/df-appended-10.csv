0,0,"Kasahara, T",2009 ,Treating causes not symptoms: restoration of surface-groundwater interactions in rivers,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"Many river restoration projects seek to address issues associated with impaired hydrological and ecological connectivity in longitudinal (e. g. effects of dams, weirs) or lateral (e. g. alienated floodplain) dimensions. Efforts to restore the vertical dimension of impaired stream-groundwater exchange are rare, hampered by limited understanding of the factors controlling this linkage in natural alluvial rivers. We propose a simplified two-axis model of the 'primary drivers' (sediment structure and vertical hydraulic gradient) of stream-groundwater exchange that acknowledges their interaction and provides a practical template to help researchers and river managers pose hypothesis-driven solutions to restoration of damaged or lost vertical connectivity. Many human activities impact on one or both of these drivers, and we review some of the tools available for treating the causes (rather than symptoms) in impacted stream reaches. For example, creating riffle-pool sequences along stream reaches will enhance vertical hydraulic gradient, whereas flushing flows can remove clogging layers and sustain sediment permeability. Our model is a first step to specifying mechanisms for recovery of lost vertical connectivity. Assessing results of river restoration using this approach at reach to catchment scales will provide scientific insights into the interplay of hydrology, fluvial geomorphology and river ecosystem function at appropriately broad scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000270029800012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTreating%2Bcauses%2Bnot%2Bsymptoms%253A%2Brestoration%2Bof%2Bsurface-groundwater%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DTamao%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DKasahara%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FMF09047%26rft.eissn%3D1448-6059%26rft.epage%3D981%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1323-1650%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D976-981%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D976%26rft.stitle%3DMAR%2BFRESHWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D60%26rft.au%3DKasahara%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1071/MF09047,"conservation,groundwater,hydrological exchange,hyporheic zone,river health,river restoration,sediment structure","SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,LOW-ENERGY,STREAM,MODEL,ASSEMBLAGES,TRANSPORT,QUALITY,SYSTEM,DEBRIS",,"Mahidol Univ, Fac Environm & Resource Studies, 999 Phuttamonthon 4 Rd, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand"
1,1,"Denfeld, BA",2013 ,"Summer CO2 evasion from streams and rivers in the Kolyma River basin, north-east Siberia",POLAR RESEARCH,"Inland water systems are generally supersaturated in carbon dioxide (CO2) and are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the global carbon cycle. The Arctic may be particularly important in this respect, given the abundance of inland waters and carbon contained in Arctic soils; however, a lack of trace gas measurements from small streams in the Arctic currently limits this understanding. We investigated the spatial variability of CO2 evasion during the summer low-flow period from streams and rivers in the northern portion of the Kolyma River basin in north-eastern Siberia. To this end, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and gas exchange velocities (k) were measured at a diverse set of streams and rivers to calculate CO2 evasion fluxes. We combined these CO2 evasion estimates with satellite remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to calculate total areal CO2 emissions. Our results show that small streams are substantial sources of atmospheric CO2 owing to high pCO(2) and k, despite being a small portion of total inland water surface area. In contrast, large rivers were generally near equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Extrapolating our findings across the Panteleikha - Ambolikha sub-watersheds demonstrated that small streams play a major role in CO2 evasion, accounting for 86% of the total summer CO2 emissions from inland waters within these two sub-watersheds. Further expansion of these regional CO2 emission estimates across time and space will be critical to accurately quantify and understand the role of Arctic streams and rivers in the global carbon budget.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000328488200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B19704%26rft.atitle%3DSummer%2BCO2%2Bevasion%2Bfrom%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%2Bin%2Bthe%2BKolyma%2BRiver%2Bbasin%252C%2Bnorth-east%2BSiberia%26rft.aufirst%3DBlaize%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DBA%26rft.aulast%3DDenfeld%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3402%252Fpolar.v32i0.19704%26rft.eissn%3D1751-8369%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0800-0395%26rft.jtitle%3DPOLAR%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DPOLAR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DDenfeld%252C%2BBA%26rft.au%3DFrey%252C%2BKE%26rft.au%3DHolmes%252C%2BRM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=POLAR+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3402/polar.v32i0.19704,"Arctic streams and rivers,CO2 evasion,inland water surface area,Kolyma River,pCO(2),Siberia","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,DIOXIDE,PERMAFROST,SUPERSATURATION,DYNAMICS,WATERS,LAKES,CH4",,"Clark Univ, Grad Sch Geog, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA"
2,2,"Lewin, J",Jun 15 2014 ,Defining large river channel patterns: Alluvial exchange and plurality,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Large rivers have anabranching channels with components that may be defined as braided, meandering or straight. This paper shows that application of such holistic terminologies is complicated by recognition of within-type and transitional-type variety, a confusingly varied use of terms, and a coverage of pattern characteristics that for many large rivers is incomplete. In natural states, big rivers can be plural systems in which main, accessory, tributary and floodplain channels and lakes differ functionally and vary in terms of morphological dynamics. A distinction is drawn between the hydrological and geomorphological connectivity of components in big river plural systems. At any one time, even at flood stage, only some channels are geomorphologically active. Six types of geomorphological connectivity are described that range from coupled, through to partially-coupled and decoupled. The interplay between geomorphological and hydrological connectivity in large rivers is shown to determine habitat status and therefore ecological diversity. For improved understanding of the dynamics as well as the forms of these large composite systems, it is helpful to: (1) adopt element-level specification, not only for sediment bodies, but also for functioning channels; (2) track the sediment transfer processes and exchanges that produce channel forms over the highly varied timescales operating within large rivers; and (3) recognise the ways in which partially coupled and connected geomorphological systems produce naturally a composite set of forms at different rates. Such augmenting information will provide an improved platform for both river management and ecological understanding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

3,3,"Schmitgen, LM",Dec 2021 ,Model Choice Impacts the Quantification of Seasonal Hyporheic Exchange Depths and Fluxes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Direction and depths of hyporheic exchange fluxes at the groundwater - surface water interface are drivers of biogeochemical processes influencing nutrient cycling and water quality. Model concepts on the dynamic relationship between hyporheic exchange fluxes and exchange depth are typically based on the assumption of a linear relationship between both measures. Here, we quantify seasonal and episodic variations of hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic exchange depths with methods of heat tracing. Numerically (FLUX-BOT) and analytically (VFLUX; method based on temperature amplitude dampening developed by Hatch et al., 2006, https://doi.org/10.1029/2005wr004787) working program scripts were used to solve the one-dimensional conduction-advection-dispersion equation and compute hyporheic flux rates from three vertical sediment water temperature profiles recorded continuously in a small low mountain creek between 2011 and 2017. By comparing the behavior of two differing water temperature-based modeling approaches, dissimilarities in the sensitivity to sediment thermal properties were identified. Besides the differences in parameter responsivity differences in how the temperature data is incorporated, explain deviating behavior of the models regarding exchange flux and depth calculations. We show that the vertical extension of hyporheic exchange depth has a distinctive seasonal pattern over seven years, which differs according to the positioning in the riffle-pool-sequence. Surface water levels, groundwater levels and stream discharges show significant correlations with both flux direction and hyporheic zone extension. Temperature derived flux data allowed for establishing a significant relationship between hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic exchange depths.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000735901700067,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030298%26rft.atitle%3DModel%2BChoice%2BImpacts%2Bthe%2BQuantification%2Bof%2BSeasonal%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BDepths%2Band%2BFluxes%26rft.aufirst%3DLara-Maria%26rft.auinit%3DLM%26rft.aulast%3DSchmitgen%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030298%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DSchmitgen%252C%2BLM%26rft.au%3DBierl%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DSchuetz%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR030298,,"TEMPERATURE TIME-SERIES,WATER FLUX,THERMAL-DIFFUSIVITY,RESIDENCE TIMES,GROUNDWATER,ZONE,STREAM,HEAT,FLOW,VARIABILITY",,"Univ Trier, Dept Hydrol, Fac Reg & Environm Sci, Trier, Germany"
4,4,"Zimmer, MA",Mar 2015 ,Pre- and postrestoration assessment of stream water-groundwater interactions: effects on hydrological and chemical heterogeneity in the hyporheic zone,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Reach-scale stream restoration with natural channel design is often used to improve stream ecosystem structure and function. Some investigators have studied the effects of restoration on the hyporheic zone, but most used space-for-time substitution instead of comparing the same reach before and after restoration. We examined spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange rates and geochemistry during base flow in a 30-m pool-riffle-pool sequence before and 1 y after the stream was restored by installation of a cross-vane and engineered rock-riffle. Prerestoration vertical hyporheic exchange rates were relatively uniform across the riffle bedform. Average downwelling was 30 cm/d at or upstream of the riffle, and average upwelling was 30 cm/d downstream of the riffle. Downwelling hyporheic exchange rates increased up to an order of magnitude adjacent to the cross-vane and in the engineered rock-riffle. Prerestoration porewater [NO3-] was distributed along a wide and continuous gradient (0.1-3.8 mg/L), with higher concentrations in areas of downwelling and lower concentrations in areas of upwelling. Postrestoration [NO3-] was distributed bimodally with relatively high concentrations (>1.6 mg/L) adjacent to the cross-vane and low concentrations (<1 mg/L) elsewhere. These results suggest that rapid flushing of surface water through the subsurface creates residence times too short to yield net changes in [NO3-] along flow paths around the cross-vane. Distinct zones of groundwater upwelling were present before and after restoration, but the size of the zone of upwelling increased downstream of the cross-vane after restoration, possibly because higher permeability material was placed over the original, lower permeability sediment during restoration, creating an effective anisotropy that favored horizontal flow and produced larger apparent zones of groundwater discharge.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000349995000022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPre-%2Band%2Bpostrestoration%2Bassessment%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bwater-groundwater%2Binteractions%253A%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bhydrological%2Band%2Bchemical%2Bheterogeneity%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DMargaret%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DZimmer%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F679514%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D300%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D287-300%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D287%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DZimmer%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DLautz%252C%2BLK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/679514,"surface-water-groundwater interactions,restoration,biogeochemistry,stream bed,Natural Channel Design,cross-vane,engineered rock-riffle","FRESH-WATER,ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION,BED FORMS,EXCHANGE,RESTORATION,CHANNEL,RIVERS,EQUILIBRIUM,PERSPECTIVE,PATTERNS",,"Duke Univ, Div Earth & Ocean Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA"
5,5,"TRISKA, FJ",Apr 1993 ,PATTERNS OF HYDROLOGICAL EXCHANGE AND NUTRIENT TRANSFORMATION IN THE HYPORHEIC ZONE OF A GRAVEL-BOTTOM STREAM - EXAMINING TERRESTRIAL AQUATIC LINKAGES,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The terrestrial-aquatic interface beneath a riparian corridor was investigated as a region of hydrological and biological control of nutrient flux. Subsurface flow paths were defined from the channel toward the riparian zone and also from the riparian zone toward the channel using tracer-injection studies. Solute transport had a rapid channel component (m min-1) and a slow hyporheic flow component (m h-1, m day-1). Subsurface flow beneath the riparian zone approximated a straight path entering at meanders but could also cross beneath the stream, possibly using relic channels.2. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the hyporheic zone ranged from < 1.0 to 9.5 mg l-1 due to permeability variations in bankside sediments. DO concentration was related to the proportion of stream water in the lateral hyporheic zone, indicating that the channel water was the DO source.3. The magnitude and timing of lateral water exchange was linked to previously published studies of nitrification and denitrification. Both nitrification potential and channel exchange decreased with distance from the channel and were absent at sites lacking effective exchange, due to low DO. Field amendment of ammonium to an aerobic flow path indicated nitrification potential under natural hydrological conditions. Denitrification potential was inversely related to channel exchange and was insignificant in channel sediments. Field amendment of acetylene plus nitrate to a flow path with low DO and minimal channel exchange indicated denitrification of amended nitrate.4. Comparison of hydraulic head to distribution of the biologically important solutes DO, ammonium, and nitrate was useful for interpreting previous findings and conceptualizing the riparian zone as a functioning ecotone between terrestrial and aquatic systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1993KY58300008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPATTERNS%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGICAL%2BEXCHANGE%2BAND%2BNUTRIENT%2BTRANSFORMATION%2BIN%2BTHE%2BHYPORHEIC%2BZONE%2BOF%2BA%2BGRAVEL-BOTTOM%2BSTREAM%2B-%2BEXAMINING%2BTERRESTRIAL%2BAQUATIC%2BLINKAGES%26rft.aufirst%3DFJ%26rft.auinit%3DFJ%26rft.aulast%3DTRISKA%26rft.date%3D1993%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.1993.tb00762.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D274%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D259-274%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D259%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DTRISKA%252C%2BFJ%26rft.au%3DDUFF%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DAVANZINO%252C%2BRJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00762.x,,"3RD-ORDER STREAM,RETENTION,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS,BUDGETS,CHANNEL,WATER,FLOW",,"US GEOL SURVEY, DIV WATER RESOURCES, 345 MIDDLEFIELD RD, MENLO PK, CA 94025 USA"
6,6,"Salehin, M",Sep 2003 ,Comparison of transient storage in vegetated and unvegetated reaches of a small agricultural stream in Sweden: seasonal variation and anthropogenic manipulation,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"In this work, we compare solute transport and hyporheic exchange in vegetated and unvegetated reaches of Sava Brook, an agricultural stream in Sweden subject to extreme variations in channel vegetation and morphology due to both natural seasonal effects and anthropogenic manipulation. A solute injection experiment was conducted in September, 2001 (late summer), at which time there was extensive in-channel vegetation in upstream reaches but none in downstream reaches due to channel excavation by farmers. Experimental results are interpreted using both the advective storage path model and the transient storage model. Results from the vegetated and excavated reaches of the stream are compared both with each other and with the results of a previous experiment conducted in April, 1998 (early spring), when the stream was not excavated but there was only minimal vegetation present in the area due to natural seasonal effects. Results from the two injection experiments are compared by using scaled parameters that appropriately include the effects of stream velocity and depth on hyporheic exchange. This analysis indicates that the variation of solute storage time in all non-excavated agricultural reaches is attributable to differences in stream flow depth, velocity, and the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed sediments. Mixing in vegetated reaches is characterized by rapid exchange and considerable lag of the mean solute peak relative to the mean channel velocity. In addition, excavation altered the stream channel geometry so as to increase the storage time of solutes and reduce the effective exchange rate. This work indicates the need to consider the effect of specific processes when analyzing hyporheic exchange using tracer-injection methods, and supports the use of model frameworks with the potential to explicitly include different formulations for various hyporheic and dead zone transport processes.

A conceptual model was developed to determine water transfer patterns, and a one-dimensional heat diffusion-advection equation was employed to estimate vertical fluxes of ten different segments in the hyporheic zone in various ten segments of the catchment. The amount of water exchange varied from 78.47 mm/d to 23.66 mm/d and a decreasing trend from the upstream to downstream of catchment was observed. The spatial correlation of variability between the water exchange and distance is 0.62. The results indicate that mountain's topography trend is the primary driver influencing the distribution of river tributaries, and the water exchange amount has a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream of the main river channel.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000396850800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B6159325%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bthe%2BSpatial%2BVariations%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BWater%2BExchange%2Bat%2BCatchment%2BScale%2BUsing%2Bthe%2BThermal%2BMethod%253A%2BA%2BCase%2BStudy%2Bin%2Bthe%2BWeihe%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DJunlong%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1155%252F2017%252F6159325%26rft.eissn%3D1687-9317%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1687-9309%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BMETEOROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BMETEOROL%26rft.volume%3D2017%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BYY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+METEOROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1155/2017/6159325,,"SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER,STREAM,TEMPERATURE,AQUIFER,HEAT,FLUX,FLOW,VARIABILITY,TOPOGRAPHY",,"Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China"
8,8,"Lautz, LK",Nov 2006 ,Modeling surface and ground water mixing in the hyporheic zone using MODFLOW and MT3D,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"We used a three-dimensional MODFLOW model, paired with MT3D, to simulate hyporheic zones around debris dams and meanders along a semi-arid stream. MT3D simulates both advective transport and sink/source mixing of solutes, in contrast to particle tracking (e.g. MODPATH), which only considers advection. We delineated the hydrochemically active hyporheic zone based on a new definition, specifically as near-stream subsurface zones receiving a minimum of 10% surface water within a 10-day travel time. Modeling results indicate that movement of surface water into the hyporheic zone is predominantly an advective process. We show that debris dams are a key driver of surface water into the subsurface along the experimental reach, causing the largest flux rates of water across the streambed and creating hyporheic zones with up to twice the cross-sectional area of other hyporheic zones. Hyporheic exchange was also found in highly sinuous segments of the experimental reach, but flux rates are lower and the cross-sectional areas of these zones are generally smaller. Our modeling approach simulated surface and ground water mixing in the hyporheic zone, and thus provides numerical approximations that are more comparable to field-based observations of surface-groundwater exchange than standard particle-tracking simulations.

Through intensive monitoring of Chalk groundwater, shallow gravel groundwater and surface water in the River Lambourn, UK, using a combination of hydrochemical and hydrophysical techniques, a complex pattern of interactions has been elucidated. The river is broadly in hydraulic contact with the streambed sediments and adjacent gravels and sands, but these deposits are mainly hydraulically separate from the underlying Chalk at the site. The hydraulic relationship between the river and underlying alluvium is variable, involving components of groundwater flow both parallel and transverse to the river and with both effluent and influent behaviour seen. While the gravel aquifer is significant in controlling groundwater/surface-water interaction, its importance as a route for flow down the catchment is likely to be modest compared with river discharge. The hydrological complexity revealed in a geological setting typical of lowland UK Chalk streams has implications both for investigation methods and for management such as in the setting of environmental objectives in the European Water Framework Directive.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000280130000006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInteraction%2Bbetween%2Bgroundwater%252C%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Band%2Ba%2BChalk%2Bstream%253A%2Ba%2Bcase%2Bstudy%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BRiver%2BLambourn%252C%2BUK%26rft.aufirst%3DDavid%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DDJ%26rft.aulast%3DAllen%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-010-0592-2%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D1141%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1125-1141%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1125%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DAllen%252C%2BDJ%26rft.au%3DDarling%252C%2BWG%26rft.au%3DAbesser%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-010-0592-2,"Groundwater/surface-water interaction,Hyporheic zone,Potentiometric head,Chalk,Water quality,UK","SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,HYDROLOGICAL EXCHANGE,CATCHMENT,DYNAMICS,CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS,PERSPECTIVE",,"British Geol Survey, Maclean Bldg, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England"
10,10,"Fasching, C",Mar 2016 ,Hydrology controls dissolved organic matter export and composition in an Alpine stream and its hyporheic zone,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Streams and rivers transport dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the terrestrial environment to downstream ecosystems. In light of climate and global change it is crucial to understand the temporal dynamics of DOM concentration and composition, and its export fluxes from headwaters to larger downstream ecosystems. We monitored DOM concentration and composition based on a diurnal sampling design for 3 years in an Alpine headwater stream. We found hydrologic variability to control DOM composition and the coupling of DOM dynamics in the streamwater and the hyporheic zone. High-flow events increased DOM inputs from terrestrial sources (as indicated by the contributions of humic- and fulvic-like fluorescence), while summer baseflow enhanced the autochthonous imprint of DOM. Diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM composition were likely induced by biological processes linked to temperature and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). Floods frequently interrupted diurnal and seasonal patterns of DOM, which led to a decoupling of streamwater and hyporheic water DOM composition and delivery of aromatic and humic-like DOM to the streamwater. Accordingly, DOM export fluxes were largely of terrigenous origin as indicated by optical properties. Our study highlights the relevance of hydrologic and seasonal dynamics for the origin, composition and fluxes of DOM in an Alpine headwater stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000372166500005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrology%2Bcontrols%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bexport%2Band%2Bcomposition%2Bin%2Ban%2BAlpine%2Bstream%2Band%2Bits%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DChristina%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DFasching%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Flno.10232%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D571%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D558-571%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D558%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D61%26rft.au%3DFasching%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DUlseth%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DBattin%252C%2BTJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/lno.10232,,"BIOLOGICAL LABILITY,BOREAL CATCHMENTS,CARBON FLUXES,FLOW PATHS,FLUORESCENCE,RIVER,DOC,VARIABILITY,WATER,BIOAVAILABILITY",,"Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Stream Biofilm & Ecosyst Res Lab, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland"

The potential for hyporheic exchange in covered channels (i.e., ice-covered channels, karst conduits, fractures) with permeable sediments has not yet been assessed. We characterize the potential for hyporheic exchange in covered channels using linked turbulent channel flow/groundwater flow simulations. Simulations show that hyporheic exchange occurs in covered channels which have shallower hyporheic zones and larger hyporheic fluxes than equivalent-depth equivalent-discharge uncovered channels. We also analyzed hyporheic exchange for the case of freely floating covers with rough undersides and found that hyporheic exchange decreases with increasing cover roughness which in turn is driven by subdued bed topography, a response to additional resistance due to covers. The results suggest that hyporheic exchange occurs in covered channels and may be just as or perhaps more important to the ecology and biogeochemistry of these channels than to open channel streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000254170200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW03418%26rft.atitle%3DComparison%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bunder%2Bcovered%2Band%2Buncovered%2Bchannels%2Bbased%2Bon%2Blinked%2Bsurface%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bflow%2Bsimulations%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BBayani%26rft.auinit%3DMB%26rft.aulast%3DCardenas%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2007WR006506%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2007WR006506,,"RIVER ICE HYDROLOGY,NUMERICAL-MODEL,STREAMS,ZONES,RESISTANCE,TRANSPORT,DISCHARGE,ECOLOGY,DUNE",,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA"

We studied seasonal and spatial patterns of abiotic parameters in the hyporheic zone of a lowland stream, in which the depth of the sandy sediment is limited by a layer of iron pan, a cemented and firm Fe- and Mn-rich horizon that hinders exchange between stream/interstitial water and ground water. Temperature, dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic matter, phosphorus, and nitrogen compounds in the interstitial water reflected the conditions of the infiltrating channel water. Concentrations of the abiotic parameters varied within the same ranges at all investigated depths, suggesting that interstitial water and channel water were very homogeneous. The exception was dissolved oxygen, where interstitial concentration was lower. However, the spatial distribution of interstitial dissolved oxygen, examined at a small scale (decimetre/centimetre level), did not follow a uniform pattern.

13,13,"Piscart, C",Sep 15 2011 ,Leaf litter recycling in benthic and hyporheic layers in agricultural streams with different types of land use,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Changes in land use and intensification of agricultural pressure have greatly accelerated the alteration of the landscape in most developed countries. These changes may greatly disturb the adjacent ecosystems, particularly streams, where the effects of pollution are amplified. In this study, we used the leaf litter breakdown rate to assess the functional integrity of stream ecosystems and river sediments along a gradient of either traditional extensive farming or a gradient of vineyard area. In the benthic layer, the total litter breakdown process integrates the temporal variability of the anthropogenic disturbances and is strongly influenced by land use changes in the catchment even though a low concentration of toxics was measured during the study period. This study also confirmed the essential role played by amphipods in the litter breakdown process. In contrast, microbial processes may have integrated the variations in available nutrients and dissolved oxygen concentrations, but failed to respond to the disturbances induced by vineyard production (the increase in pesticides and metal concentrations) during the study period. The response of microbes may not be sensitive enough for assessing the global effect of seasonal agricultural practices. Finally, the leaf litter breakdown measured in the hyporheic zone seemed mainly driven by microbial activities and was hence more affected by vertical exchanges with surface water than by land use practices. However, the breakdown rate of leaf litter in the hyporheic zone may constitute a relevant way to evaluate the impact on river functioning of any human activities that induce massive soil erosion and sediment clogging.

In Sycamore Creek, the primary study site (studied during summer and early autumn), methane content of interstitial water exhibited a distinct spatial pattern. In hyporheic (sediments beneath the wetted channel) and parfluvial zones (active channel sediments lateral to the wetted channel), which were well oxygenated due to high hydrologic exchange with the surface stream and had little particulate organic matter (POM), interstitial methane concentration averaged only 0.03 mgCH(4)-C/L. Bank sediments (interface between the active channel and riparian zone), in contrast, which were typically vegetated, had high POM, low hydrologic exchange and concomitantly low dissolved oxygen levels, had interstitial concentration averaging 1.5 mgCH(4)-C/L. Methane emission from Sycamore Creek, similar to methane concentration, averaged only 3.7 mgCH(4)-C . m(-2). d(-1) from hyporheic and parafluvial zones as opposed to 170 mgCH(4)-C . m(-2). d(-1) from anoxic bank sediments. Methane in four additional streams sampled (one sampling date during late winter) was low and exhibited little spatial variation most likely due to cooler stream temperatures. Interstitial methane in parafluvial and bank sediments of all four streams ranged from only 0.005 to 0.1 mgCH(4)-C/L. Similarly methane evasion was also low from these streams varying from 0 to 5.7 mgCH(4)-C . m(-2). d(-1). The effects of organic matter and temperature on methanogenesis were further examined by experimentally manipulating POM and temperature in stoppered flasks filled with hyporheic sediments and stream water. Methane production significantly increased with all independent variables. Methane production is greatest in bank sediments that are relatively isolated hydrologically and lowest in hyporheic and parafluvial sediments that are interactive with the surface stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1995TV50300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMethanogenesis%2Bin%2BArizona%252C%2BUSA%2Bdryland%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJB%26rft.auinit%3DJB%26rft.aulast%3DJones%26rft.date%3D1995%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00004047%26rft.epage%3D173%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D155-173%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D155%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DJones%252C%2BJB%26rft.au%3DHolmes%252C%2BRM%26rft.au%3DGreene%252C%2BDM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/BF00004047,"methane,methanogenesis,arid-lands,Sonoran Desert,streams,hydrologic exchange","SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,FRESH-WATER,BILLABONG SEDIMENTS,ATMOSPHERIC METHANE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,ORGANIC-MATTER,SURFACE-WATER,METABOLISM,EMISSIONS",,
15,15,"Ward, AS",Apr 23 2020 ,"Climate Change Causes River Network Contraction and Disconnection in the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA",FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Headwater streams account for more than 89% of global river networks and provide numerous ecosystem services that benefit downstream ecosystems and human water uses. It has been established that changes in climate have shifted the timing and magnitude of observed precipitation, which, at specific gages, have been directly linked to long-term reductions in large river discharge. However, climate impacts on ungaged headwater streams, where ecosystem function is tightly coupled to flow permanence along the river corridor, remain unknown due to the lack of data sets and ability to model and predict flow permanence. We analyzed a network of 10 gages with 38-69 years of records across a 5th-order river basin in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, finding increasing frequency of lower low-flow conditions across the basin. Next, we simulated river network expansion and contraction for a 65-year period of record, revealing 24% and 9% declines in flowing and contiguous network length, respectively, during the driest months of the year. This study is the first to mechanistically simulate network expansion and contraction at the scale of a large river basin, informing if and how climate change is altering connectivity along river networks. While the heuristic model presented here yields basin-specific conclusions, this approach is generalizable and transferable to the study of other large river basins. Finally, we interpret our model results in the context of regulations based on flow permanence, demonstrating the complications of static regulatory definitions in the face of non-stationary climate.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000659477100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B7%26rft.atitle%3DClimate%2BChange%2BCauses%2BRiver%2BNetwork%2BContraction%2Band%2BDisconnection%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHJ%2BAndrews%2BExperimental%2BForest%252C%2BOregon%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2020.00007%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D2%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DHerzog%252C%2BSP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/frwa.2020.00007,"river corridor,river network,intermittent,ephemeral,stream,hyporheic,climate","HEADWATER MOUNTAIN STREAM,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,CASCADE MOUNTAINS,CONNECTIVITY,FLOW,DISTRIBUTIONS,DYNAMICS,ZONE",,"Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA"
16,16,"Ibrahim, A",Aug 1 2020 ,Estimating the Hyporheic Depth Beneath a Pool-Riffle Bedform Using the Rankine Body Analytical Method,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The hyporheic zone connects groundwater and surface water allowing active exchange of water and solute, and thus plays a vital role in many hydrological and ecological processes. Many sophisticated high-dimensional models have been developed to study the hyporheic zone, but they require extensive site information and may involve significant time and effort to set up. This emphasizes the need for a preliminary characterization. This paper proposes an analytical model based on the Rankine body method to estimate the maximum hyporheic depth using minimal site information. The hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium is not needed, and for thick alluvium it is not necessary to know the location of any underlying impervious layer. Applied to an idealized pool-riffle sequence, the proposed method is able to calculate the maximum hyporheic depth to within 20% of those from a two-dimensional (2D) reference numerical model for a wide range of conditions. Comparable results are also achieved with other independent studies for hyporheic zone under various bedforms, surface flows, and alluvium conditions. The proposed method provides a quick estimate of the hyporheic depth, which would be useful in the design of a field data collection program and/or a numerical modeling study.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000542680000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B04020034%26rft.atitle%3DEstimating%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BDepth%2BBeneath%2Ba%2BPool-Riffle%2BBedform%2BUsing%2Bthe%2BRankine%2BBody%2BAnalytical%2BMethod%26rft.aufirst%3DAhmad%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DIbrahim%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HE.1943-5584.0001944%26rft.eissn%3D1943-5584%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1084-0699%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DIbrahim%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSteffler%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DShe%252C%2BYT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001944,"Analytical model,Rankine body,Hyporheic zone delineation,Hyporheic depth,Coupled groundwater and surface water models,Pool-riffle bedform","BED FORMS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,STREAM,WATER,ZONE,FLOW,EXCHANGE,SCIENCE,MODEL",,"Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada"
17,17,"Phanikumar, MS",May 1 2007 ,Separating surface storage from hyporheic retention in natural streams using wavelet decomposition of acoustic Doppler current profiles,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The ability to separate surface storage (e.g., due to in-channel features such as eddies and pools) from retention due to hyporheic exchange is important in many solute transport considerations; however, current stream tracer approaches do not allow such separation. We examined transient storage processes in a fourth-order Michigan stream using tracer studies, numerical flow and transport models, and hydrodynamic data obtained from acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) surveys. Since the high-resolution, three-dimensional velocity fields obtained from an ADCP relate to in-channel processes, we used wavelet decomposition to separate the flow into regions of slow and fast moving zones and to estimate the relative sizes of the main channel (A) and the storage zones (AS). Transport modeling based on the tracer data provided estimates of storage zone sizes that included contributions from both surface storage and hyporheic exchange. By coupling the estimates from tracer data with those obtained from an ADCP we were able to assess the relative importance of surface storage in different stream reaches. Estimated (A(S)/A) values in three test reaches ranged from 0.12 to 0.22, and transient storage residence times varied from approximately 4 min in a run reach dominated by surface storage (reach A) to about 13 min in a reach with some potential for hyporheic exchange (reach C). In reach A the (A(S)/A) values estimated from tracer and ADCP data were in good agreement, indicating that in-channel processes were the main mechanism responsible for storage in this reach. Reach C estimates, however, showed that surface storage (A(S)/A= 0.05) accounted for only a fraction of the transient storage estimated using tracer data (A(S)/A = 0.12), which indicated that hyporheic exchange contributed to transient storage in the reach. The wavelet decomposition approach based on the ADCP data provides a framework to better constrain transient storage models and to eliminate unrealistic parameters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000246309700004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW05406%26rft.atitle%3DSeparating%2Bsurface%2Bstorage%2Bfrom%2Bhyporheic%2Bretention%2Bin%2Bnatural%2Bstreams%2Busing%2Bwavelet%2Bdecomposition%2Bof%2Bacoustic%2BDoppler%2Bcurrent%2Bprofiles%26rft.aufirst%3DMantha%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DMS%26rft.aulast%3DPhanikumar%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2006WR005104%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DPhanikumar%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DAslam%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DVoice%252C%2BTC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2006WR005104,,"TRANSIENT STORAGE,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAMS,WATER EXCHANGE,DEAD ZONE,MODEL,FLOW,DISTRIBUTIONS,RIVERS",,"Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, A130 Engn Res Complex, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA"
18,18,"Wang, Z",Jun 15 2022 ,Streambed microbial communities in the transition zone between groundwater and a first-order stream as impacted by bidirectional water exchange,WATER RESEARCH,"The input of nitrate and other agricultural pollutants in higher-order streams largely derives from first-order streams. The streambed as the transition zone between groundwater and stream water has a decisive impact on the attenuation of such pollutants. This reactivity is not yet well understood for lower-order agricultural streams, which are often anthropogenically altered and lack the streambed complexity allowing for extensive hyporheic exchange. Reactive hot spots in such streambeds have been hypothesized as a function of hydrology, which controls the local gaining (groundwater exfiltration) or losing (infiltration) of stream water. However, streambed microbial communities and activities associated with such reactive zones remain mostly uncharted. In this study, sediments of a first-order agriculturally impacted stream in southern Germany were investigated. Along with a hydraulic dissection of distinct gaining and losing reaches of the stream, community composition and the abundance of bacterial communities in the streambed were investigated using PacBio long-read sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons, and qPCR of bacterial 16S rRNA and denitrification genes (nirK and nirS). We show that bidirectional water exchange between groundwater and the stream represents an important control for sediment microbiota, especially for nitrate-reducing populations. Typical heterotrophic denitrifiers were most abundant in a midstream net losing section, while up-and downstream net gaining sections were associated with an enrichment of sulfur-oxidizing potential nitrate reducers affiliated with Sulfuricurvum and Thiobacillus spp. Dispersal-based community assembly was found to dominate such spots of groundwater exfiltration. Our results indicate a coupling of N-and S-cycling processes in the streambed of an agricultural first-order stream, and a prominent control of microbiology by hydrology and hydrochemistry in situ. Such detailed local heterogeneities in exchange fluxes and streambed microbiomes have not been reported to date, but seem relevant for understanding the reactivity of lower-order streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000795907900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B118334%26rft.atitle%3DStreambed%2Bmicrobial%2Bcommunities%2Bin%2Bthe%2Btransition%2Bzone%2Bbetween%2Bgroundwater%2Band%2Ba%2Bfirst-order%2Bstream%2Bas%2Bimpacted%2Bby%2Bbidirectional%2Bwater%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DZhe%26rft.auinit%3DZ%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.watres.2022.118334%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2448%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1354%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D217%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DJimenez-Fernandez%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DLueders%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118334,"Lower-order streams,Streambed microbiomes,Nitrate reduction,Losing and gaining stream,Groundwater-surface water exchange","SP-NOV.,HYPORHEIC ZONE,ASSEMBLY PROCESSES,NITRITE REDUCTASE,DRAINAGE DITCHES,NITRATE-REMOVAL,DENITRIFICATION,RIVER,DYNAMICS,STORAGE",,"Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Chair Ecol Microbiol, Bayreuth, Germany"
19,19,"Siergieiev, D",2015 ,Modelling hyporheic processes for regulated rivers under transient hydrological and hydrogeological conditions,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Understanding the effects of major hydrogeological controls on hyporheic exchange and bank storage is essential for river water management, groundwater abstraction, restoration and ecosystem sustainability. Analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundary conditions, varying geometry of surface water-groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. To understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) bank storage, (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2-D hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. The numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower-regulated Lule River, northern Sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long-lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. Modelling results revealed that bank storage increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. When a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river-aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected bank storage. The presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity < 0.001 m d(-1) significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated bank storage. The bank storage return/fill time ratio was positively related to wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. Discharge oscillations with short duration and small amplitude decreased bank storage and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish-spawning locations. Based on these results, river regulation strategies can be improved by considering the effect of certain wave event configurations on hyporheic exchange to ensure harmonious hydrogeochemical functioning of the river-aquifer interfaces and related ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000348929800018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModelling%2Bhyporheic%2Bprocesses%2Bfor%2Bregulated%2Brivers%2Bunder%2Btransient%2Bhydrological%2Band%2Bhydrogeological%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DD.%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DSiergieiev%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-19-329-2015%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D340%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D329-340%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D329%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DSiergieiev%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DEhlert%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DLiedl%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/hess-19-329-2015,,"FLOW REGULATION,SURFACE-WATER,BANK STORAGE,GROUNDWATER,ZONE,EXCHANGE,STAGE,DISCHARGE,RESPONSES,AQUIFER",,"Lulea Univ Technol, Div Geosci & Environm Engn, S-95187 Lulea, Sweden"

To improve understanding of these processes through visual demonstration, we created a hyporheic flow simulation in the multi-agent computer modeling platform NetLogo. The simulation shows virtual tracer flowing through a streambed covered with two-dimensional bedforms. Sediment, flow, and bedform characteristics are used as input variables for the model. We illustrate how these simulations match experimental observations from laboratory flume experiments based on measured input parameters. Dye is injected into the flume sediments to visualize the porewater flow. For comparison virtual tracer particles are placed at the same locations in the simulation. This coupled simulation and lab experiment has been used successfully in undergraduate and graduate laboratories to directly visualize river-porewater interactions and show how physically-based flow simulations can reproduce environmental phenomena. Students took photographs of the bed through the transparent flume walls and compared them to shapes of the dye at the same times in the simulation. This resulted in very similar trends, which allowed the students to better understand both the flow patterns and the mathematical model. The simulations also allow the user to quickly visualize the impact of each input parameter by running multiple simulations. This process can also be used in research applications to illustrate basic processes, relate interfacial fluxes and porewater transport, and support quantitative process-based modeling.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000368573900050,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be53285%26rft.atitle%3DVisualizing%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2BThrough%2BBedforms%2BUsing%2BDye%2BExperiments%2Band%2BSimulation%26rft.aufirst%3DSusa%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DSH%26rft.aulast%3DStonedahl%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3791%252F53285%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1940-087X%26rft.issue%3D105%26rft.jtitle%3DJOVE-JOURNAL%2BOF%2BVISUALIZED%2BEXPERIMENTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJOVE-J%2BVIS%2BEXP%26rft.au%3DStonedahl%252C%2BSH%26rft.au%3DRoche%252C%2BKR%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=JOVE-JOURNAL+OF+VISUALIZED+EXPERIMENTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3791/53285,"Engineering,Issue 105,Hyporheic,Flume,Bedforms,Simulation,Dye,Ripples,Solute","NONSORBING SOLUTES,EXCHANGE,STREAM,TRANSPORT,NITROGEN,IMPACT,CREEK",,"St Ambrose Univ, Engn & Phys Sci, Davenport, IA 52803 USA"
21,21,"Peyrard, D",Oct 15 2008 ,A coupled vertically integrated model to describe lateral exchanges between surface and subsurface in large alluvial floodplains with a fully penetrating river,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This paper presents a vertically averaged model for studying water and solute exchanges between a large river and its adjacent alluvial aquifer flow. The hydrolic model couples horizontal 2D Saint Venant equation for river flow and a 2D Dupuit equation for aquifer flow. The dynamic coupling between river and aquifer is provided by continuity of fluxes and water level elevation between the two domains. Equations are solved simultaneously by linking the two hydrological system matrices in a single global matrix in order to ensure the continuity conditions between river and aquifer and to accurately model two-way coupling between these two domains. The model is applied to a large reach (about 36 km(2)) of the Garonne River (south-western France) and its floodplain, including an instrumented site in a meander. Simulated hydraulic heads are compared with experimental measurements on the Garonne River and aquifer in the floodplain. Model verification includes comparisons for one point sampling date (27 piezometers, 30 March 2000) and for hydraulic heads variations measured continuously over 5 months (5 piezometers, 1 June 2000). The model accurately reproduces the strong hydraulic connections between the Garonne River and its aquifer, which are confirmed by the simultaneous variation of the water level in the river and in piezometers located near the river bank. The simulations also confirmed that the model is able to reproduce ground water flow dynamics during flood events. Given these result, the hydraulic model was coupled with a solute-transport component, based on advection-dispersion equations, to investigate the theoretical dynamics of a conservative tracer over 5 years throughout the 36 km(2) reach studied. Meanders were shown to favour exchanges between river and aquifer, and although the tracer was diluted in the river, the contamination moved from the injection plots and affected both river banks.

22,22,"Ward, AS",Apr 2018 ,"Simulation of dynamic expansion, contraction, and connectivity in a mountain stream network",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Headwater stream networks expand and contract in response to changes in stream discharge. The changes in the extent of the stream network are also controlled by geologic or geomorphic setting - some reaches go dry even under relatively wet conditions, other reaches remain flowing under relatively dry conditions. While such patterns are well recognized, we currently lack tools to predict the extent of the stream network and the times and locations where the network is dry within large river networks. Here, we develop a perceptual model of the river corridor in a headwater mountainous catchment, translate this into a reduced-complexity mechanistic model, and implement the model to examine connectivity and network extent over an entire water year. Our model agreed reasonably well with our observations, showing that the extent and connectivity of the river network was most sensitive to hydrologic forcing under the lowest discharges (Q(gauge) < 1 L s(-1)), that at intermediate discharges (1 L s(-1) < Q(gauge) < 10 L s(-1)) the extent of the network changed dramatically with changes in discharge, and that under wet conditions (Q(gauge) > 10 L s(-1)) the extent of the network was relatively insensitive to hydrologic forcing and was instead determined by the network topology. We do not expect that the specific thresholds observed in this study would be transferable to other catchments with different geology, topology, or hydrologic forcing. However, we expect that the general pattern should be robust: the dominant controls will shift from hydrologic forcing to geologic setting as discharge increases. Furthermore, our method is readily transferable as the model can be applied with minimal data requirements (a single stream gauge, a digital terrain model, and estimates of hydrogeologic properties) to estimate flow duration or connectivity along the river corridor in unstudied catchments. As the available information increases, the model could be better calibrated to match site-specific observations of network extent, locations of dry reaches, or solute break through curves as demonstrated in this study. Based on the low initial data requirements and ability to later tune the model to a specific site, we suggest example applications of this parsimonious model that may prove useful to both researchers and managers.

24,24,"Hu, HZ",Nov 2014 ,Impact of microforms on nitrate transport at the groundwater-surface water interface in gaining streams,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Small streambed structures (or microforms, 0.01-1 m in length) exist ubiquitously in riverbed systems. Small-scale topography is potentially important in controlling hyporheic exchange flow and transport of conservative and reactive solutes at the groundwater-surface water interface. The role of microforms on NO3- transfer in a riffle-scale (macroforms of > 1 m length) hyporheic zone within a gaining river setting is investigated using a 2-D flow and transport model which accounts for both nitrification and denitrification. Results show that the short pathlines caused by microforms lead to more NO3- discharge to the river compared with a macroform-only condition due to shortened residence times of both surface water and groundwater in mixing zones. Short hyporheic exchange flow pathways caused by microforms could remain oxic along their entire length or switch from nitrate producing to nitrate consuming as oxygen concentrations decline. Microforms affect net NO3- flux by the combined effect of introducing more stream mass flux and reducing their residence time in mixing zones under different hydrological and biogeochemical conditions. Our findings underscore that ignoring microforms in river beds may underestimate NO3- load to the river and have practical implications for pore water sampling strategies in groundwater-surface water studies.

25,25,"Storey, RG",Nov 2004 ,Spatial responses of hyporheic invertebrates to seasonal changes in environmental parameters,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Spatial relationships between hyporheic invertebrates and subsurface water flow patterns, sediment characteristics, water physicochemical parameters and several possible food sources were compared over three seasons at one site beneath a riffle. Measures of food sources included particulate organic matter (POM), bacterial activity (aerobic respiration, nitrate respiration and mineralisation of organic nitrogen) and microbial abundance.2. Patterns of water flow changed significantly over the 9-month study period, from predominantly upwelling beneath the entire riffle in spring, to distinct differentiation between downwelling and upwelling zones in summer and autumn. Water physicochemical parameters changed accordingly, showing gradually weaker correlations with depth and stronger correlations with zone between spring and autumn.3. Despite these changes, depth remained the strongest predictor of invertebrate richness, density and taxon composition throughout the study period. However, invertebrate distributions were secondarily correlated with water physicochemical parameters, and a minor gradient in invertebrate distributions between downwelling and upwelling zones became stronger from spring to summer.4. The correlations between invertebrates and physicochemical parameters changed in both magnitude and direction with season. In spring, invertebrates showed a negative correlation with surface water infiltration, whereas in summer and autumn, the correlation was positive. Correlations were strongest in summer, when interstitial dissolved oxygen concentrations were lowest.5. No relationships were found between hyporheic invertebrates and POM, microbial abundance or activity. This suggests that at this site, proximity to the streambed surface and physicochemical variables are more important than the abundance of food in controlling invertebrate distributions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000224434500008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Bresponses%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Binvertebrates%2Bto%2Bseasonal%2Bchanges%2Bin%2Benvironmental%2Bparameters%26rft.aufirst%3DRG%26rft.auinit%3DRG%26rft.aulast%3DStorey%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2004.01284.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1486%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1468-1486%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1468%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DStorey%252C%2BRG%26rft.au%3DWilliams%252C%2BDD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01284.x,"hyporheic,invertebrates,lotic,meiofauna,streams","ORGANIC-MATTER,STREAM,SEDIMENT,EXCHANGE,SURFACE,ZONE,RIFFLE,FAUNA,RIVER,MEIOFAUNA",,"Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 11-115, Hamilton, New Zealand"

However, the synoptic impact of intense agricultural or urban land-uses, elevated nutrient loading, flow alterations, riparian clear-cutting, and channelization on the source-sink behavior of solutes in hyporheic zones remains largely uncharacterized and unquantified. Therefore, we studied nutrient dynamics in a hydromorphologically and chemically modified stream reach using a new monitoring approach allowing the simultaneous measurement of nutrient and water flux through a screened area in the subsurface of rivers (hyporheic passive flux meter, HPFM). With HPFMs we directly assessed time-integrated lateral hyporheic nitrate fluxes during early spring and midsummer covering different temperature and discharge regimes. Contrary to our expectations, higher stream discharge coincided with substantially lower hyporheic exchange rates. While in streams featuring a natural morphology, bed form induced exchange commonly increases with surface flow, the influence of groundwater level was dominant in this reach. Furthermore, in contrast to less impacted environments, where progressive substrate depletion with depths reduces metabolic rates in the subsurface, we identified not the upper, but the intermediate layer of the hyporheic zone as hot spot of nutrient turnover. Overall, the hyporheic zone at the study site functioned partly as nitrate source, partly as a sink. Neither of the commonly used determinants redox state and residence time could explain this source or sink function. Our results give clear evidence to carefully transfer the knowledge of hyporheic zone processes from ""natural'' systems to anthropologically modified streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000423299000010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BPassive%2BFlux%2BMeters%2BReveal%2BInverse%2BVertical%2BZonation%2Band%2BHigh%2BSeasonality%2Bof%2BNitrogen%2BProcessing%2Bin%2Ban%2BAnthropogenically%2BModified%2BStream%2B%2528Holtemme%252C%2BGermany%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DJulia%2BVanessa%26rft.auinit%3DJV%26rft.aulast%3DKunz%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR020709%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D10172%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D10155-10172%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D10155%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DKunz%252C%2BJV%26rft.au%3DAnnable%252C%2BMD%26rft.au%3DBorchardt%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017WR020709,,"ORGANIC-CARBON,SURFACE-WATER,RIVER,ZONE,DENITRIFICATION,EXCHANGE,NUTRIENT,FLOW,NITRIFICATION,RESTORATION",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Magdeburg, Germany"

Hydrologic data (vertical hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments) and the topographic and morphological features of the watershed indicated diffuse inputs of groundwater from the near-stream riparian zone along this site. Cumulative groundwater discharge, determined by tracer dilution techniques, was similar to 1.5 L/s or 10% of the total stream discharge. Spatial heterogeneity in hydrologic and chemical properties of riparian and hyporheic sediments was large. Hydraulic conductivity explained much of the variation in NH4-N and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, with highest concentrations in sites having low conductivity. A mass-balance approach was used to examine the influence of the near-stream zone on nutrient transport and retention. Outwelling riparian groundwater had the potential to increase stream N concentrations by up to 84% and DOC concentrations by up to 38% along our 100-m reach. Because stream concentrations were constant downstream despite this input, we conclude that significant N and C retention or loss were occurring in the near-stream zone. Lotic ecosystems and their associated riparian groundwater can have a quantitatively significant impact on the nutrient budgets of tropical headwater catchments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000088106300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DC%2Band%2BN%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2Briparian%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%2Bof%2Ba%2Btropical%2Bstream%252C%2BLuquillo%2BMountains%252C%2BPuerto%2BRico%26rft.aufirst%3DTJ%26rft.auinit%3DTJ%26rft.aulast%3DChestnut%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468065%26rft.epage%3D214%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D199-214%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D199%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DChestnut%252C%2BTJ%26rft.au%3DMcDowell%252C%2BWH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1468065,"tropical rainforest,nutrient cycling,nitrogen,DOC,riparian zone,hyporheic zone,hydrologic characteristics","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,CENTRAL AMAZON BASIN,DESERT STREAM,GROUNDWATER NITRATE,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,SURFACE-WATER,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,INORGANIC NITROGEN,STORM DYNAMICS",,"Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources, 215 James Hall, Durham, NH 03824 USA"
28,28,"Weber, MD",Jul 16 2013 ,Dynamic ice formation in channels as a driver for stream-aquifer interactions,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"This research introduces and provides evidence of a novel mechanism of stream-aquifer exchange caused by dynamic ice formation on streams. At a stream site in southwestern Wisconsin, we document a significant fluctuation in stream depth and the potentiometric surface in the adjacent aquifer during periods of ice formation, suggesting that stream-aquifer interactions may be influenced by these transient events. Four years of winter stream data document that dynamic ice formation (1) causes an average increase in stream depth of 106%, (2) affects stream depth on 20% of days from December through February, and (3) substantially alters stream-aquifer interactions by reducing the hydraulic gradient toward the channel during ice formation events. Dynamic ice formation represents a potentially widespread mechanism for altering stream-aquifer interactions and associated biogeochemical transformations. The sensitivity of this process to air temperature indicates a need for further research on the impacts of climate warming.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000326396600025,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDynamic%2Bice%2Bformation%2Bin%2Bchannels%2Bas%2Ba%2Bdriver%2Bfor%2Bstream-aquifer%2Binteractions%26rft.aufirst%3DMatthew%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DMD%26rft.aulast%3DWeber%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fgrl.50620%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D3412%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3408-3412%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3408%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DWeber%252C%2BMD%26rft.au%3DBooth%252C%2BEG%26rft.au%3DLoheide%252C%2BSP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/grl.50620,"stream-aquifer interactions,hyporheic exchange,dynamic ice formation,diurnal fluctuations,river ice","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,RIVER ICE,GROUNDWATER,ZONE,HETEROGENEITY,ECOSYSTEMS,DISCHARGE,IMPACT",,"Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1269C Engn Hall,1415 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA"
29,29,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",Aug 1998 ,Surface water-groundwater exchanges in three dimensions on a backwater of the Rhone River,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Hydrological exchange between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone is well documented in the main channel of rivers, especially at the reach scale. Hydrological processes of advection/convection occur at different scales, and in secondary channels of large rivers little is known about these exchanges in the hyporheic zone on a broad scale (i.e. kilometres). This work studied exchanges of water and biota in a secondary channel on a large scale (4 km), using a three-dimensional framework.2. The exchanges of water were described using physicochemical indicators of surface and groundwaters. Samples of water and biota were taken in three dimensions: (i) vertically from benthic (i.e. 0.20 m below the surface of the substratum) to hyporheic (0.50 m) and deep interstitial (1.0 m) zones; (ii) laterally from the right to the left bank (i.e. right, middle and left positions); and (iii) longitudinally from upstream to downstream (seven stations regularly distributed along the channel).3. The physicochemical indicators clearly revealed hydrological heterogeneity in the longitudinal and vertical dimensions, whereas lateral variability was not significant.4. Spatial distribution of biota exhibited strong longitudinal variations that were not gradual as predicted by an upstream/downstream continuum, but patchy and discontinuous. No significant differences were found between the three positions across the channel.5. Analyses of both physicochemical and faunal data sets produced matched ordination of samples and stations, indicating that interstitial-surface flow relationships appear to be an important governing factor in the distribution of interstitial biota at this broad scale.6. Results are discussed in relation to the hypothetical three-dimensional models of the hyporheic zone in rivers. Contrasting with other observations on the main channel (where advection/convection patterns are dominated by morphological changes of the river-bed morphology), it is proposed that water exchanges in backwaters are more likely to be related to local modifications of stream-bed porosity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000075462200009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSurface%2Bwater-groundwater%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Bthree%2Bdimensions%2Bon%2Ba%2Bbackwater%2Bof%2Bthe%2BRhone%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DMJ%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DDole-Olivier%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.1998.00335.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D109%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D93-109%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D93%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D40&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00335.x,,"SONORAN DESERT STREAM,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,INTEGRATING HYDROLOGY,DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS,ALLUVIAL RIVER,ECOSYSTEMS,DYNAMICS,FAUNA",,"Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, ESA 5023, Freshwater & River Ecol Res Unit, 1-43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"

Surface water was oxic and slightly basic, and ground water was anoxic and acidic. Hyporheic zone water had pH values of 6-7, dissolved oxygen concentrations mostly between 0 and 3 mg L-1, and mean concentrations of most metals inbetween surface and ground water sample concentrations. However, arsenic and iron were enriched in the hyporheic zone. Most of the hyporheic zone dissolved arsenic was in the form of As(III), which is considered to be more toxic to some organisms than As(V). In the oxic surface water, 20% of the total dissolved As was found to occur in its reduced form. We hypothesize that upon burial and reduction of Fe-oxhydroxides in the streambed, sediment-bound arsenic is transferred into the dissolved phase as As(III), and it is subsequently released into the surface water, where it does not immediately reoxidize. A continual flux of reduced As to the surface water maintains Pb(III) concentrations above that expected in oxygenated surface waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000083342400019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DArsenic%2Bmobilization%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bcontaminated%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DSA%26rft.auinit%3DSA%26rft.aulast%3DNagorski%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F1999WR900204%26rft.epage%3D3450%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3441-3450%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3441%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DNagorski%252C%2BSA%26rft.au%3DMoore%252C%2BJN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/1999WR900204,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,MOUNTAIN STREAM,NATURAL-WATERS,SURFACE-WATER,SEDIMENTS,RIVER,OXIDATION,EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER",,"Univ Montana, Dept Geol, Murdock Environm Biochem Lab, Missoula, MT 59812 USA"
31,31,"Birkel, C",Apr 2016 ,Heat-based hyporheic flux calculations in heterogeneous salmon spawning gravels,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Groundwater-surface water interactions in rivers are a critically important factor for fish spawning, as streamwater downwelling or upwelling of low-oxygen groundwater can affect egg survival. Assessing such dynamics at the reach scale using distributed temperature measurements as a tracer proved reliable in determining flux rates and directions in the hyporheic zone in a number of studies. Here, we report heat-based vertical flux rates from a heterogeneous gravel-bed stream reach used by spawning Atlantic salmon in the Scottish Highlands. Results showed mostly small downwelling fluxes (similar to 0.3 m d(-1)), which were largely independent of discharge. Contrasting, and at times unusual flux-depth profiles (e.g., increasing flux with depth) were detected, consistent with the heterogeneous streambed material causing diverse hyporheic flow paths. This was tested in a numerical 2-D model setup attempting to reproduce such behavior with variable random hydraulic conductivity (K) fields. The 2-D model clearly demonstrated that strong deviations from the expected decrease of fluxes with depth can be explained by high heterogeneity coupled with relatively low K fields. This showed that using simple 1-D heat-based flux estimates in combination with 2-D models is a useful approach to testing hypotheses about the influence of variable streambed materials on groundwater-surface water exchange in an ecological context.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000372599000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHeat-based%2Bhyporheic%2Bflux%2Bcalculations%2Bin%2Bheterogeneous%2Bsalmon%2Bspawning%2Bgravels%26rft.aufirst%3DChristian%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DBirkel%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-015-0417-4%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D213%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D203-213%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D203%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D78%26rft.au%3DBirkel%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DSoulsby%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DTetzlaff%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00027-015-0417-4,"Hyporheic zone,Heat tracer,Ground water-surface water interaction,VFLUX,Numerical 2-D model","SURFACE-WATER INTERACTIONS,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,SPATIAL-PATTERNS,EMBRYO SURVIVAL,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,VARIABILITY,DISCHARGE,MODELS,STREAM",,"Univ Aberdeen, Northern Rivers Inst, Aberdeen AB23 4UF, Scotland"
32,32,"Hirst, C",Jun 26 2020 ,"Silicon Isotopes Reveal a Non-glacial Source of Silicon to Crescent Stream, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica",FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"In high latitude environments, silicon is supplied to river waters by both glacial and non-glacial chemical weathering. The signal of these two end-members is often obscured by biological uptake and/or groundwater input in the river catchment. McMurdo Dry Valleys streams in Antarctica have no deep groundwater input, no connectivity between streams and no surface vegetation cover, and thus provide a simplified system for us to constrain the supply of dissolved silicon (DSi) to rivers from chemical weathering in a glacial environment. Here we report dissolved Si concentrations, germanium/silicon ratios (Ge/Si) and silicon isotope compositions (delta Si-30(DSi)) in Crescent Stream, McMurdo Dry Valleys for samples collected between December and February in the 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017 austral seasons. The delta(30)Si(DSi)compositions and DSi concentrations are higher than values reported in wet-based glacial meltwaters, and form a narrow cluster within the range of values reported for permafrost dominated Arctic Rivers. High delta(30)Si(DSi)compositions, ranging from +0.90 parts per thousand to +1.39 parts per thousand, are attributed to (i) the precipitation of amorphous silica during freezing of waters in isolated pockets of the hyporheic zone in the winter and the release of Si from unfrozen pockets during meltwater-hyporheic zone exchange in the austral summer, and (ii) additional Si isotope fractionation via long-term Si uptake in clay minerals and seasonal Si uptake into diatoms superimposed on this winter-derived isotope signal. There is no relationship between delta(30)Si(DSi)compositions and DSi concentrations with seasonal and daily discharge, showing that stream waters contain DSi that is in equilibrium with the formation of secondary Si minerals in the hyporheic zone. We show that delta(30)Si(DSi)compositions can be used as tracers of silicate weathering in the hyporheic zone and possible tracers of freeze-thaw conditions in the hyporheic zone. This is important in the context of the ongoing warming in McMurdo Dry Valleys and the supply of more meltwaters to the hyporheic zone of McMurdo Dry Valley streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000551655900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B229%26rft.atitle%3DSilicon%2BIsotopes%2BReveal%2Ba%2BNon-glacial%2BSource%2Bof%2BSilicon%2Bto%2BCrescent%2BStream%252C%2BMcMurdo%2BDry%2BValleys%252C%2BAntarctica%26rft.aufirst%3DCatherine%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DHirst%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffeart.2020.00229%26rft.eissn%3D2296-6463%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BEARTH%2BSC-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DHirst%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DOpfergelt%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DLyons%252C%2BWB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+EARTH+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/feart.2020.00229,"silicon isotopes,hyporheic zone,permafrost,weathering,Antarctica","SOUTHERN VICTORIA LAND,TAYLOR VALLEY,MELTWATER STREAMS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,FRYXELL BASIN,ICE-SHEET,ROSS SEA,FRACTIONATION,GERMANIUM,PERMAFROST",,"Catholic Univ Louvain, Environm Sci, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium"

Oxygen and multispecies solute transport is solved within a Lagrangian framework with transformation of DIN species modeled by linearized Monod's kinetics, with temperature-dependent reaction rate coefficients derived from field experiments. Our solutions, which are obtained under the assumptions of sediments with uniform hydraulic properties and negligible local dispersion, highlight the importance of morphological characteristics of the streambed on DIN transformations within the hyporheic zone. By means of this model we explore the effects of streambed topography and relative abundance of ammonium and nitrate in stream waters on the reactive nitrogen cycle in the hyporheic zone of gravel bed rivers with a pool and riffle morphology. Our model shows complex concentration dynamics within the hyporheic zone that may act as a source or a sink of nitrogen depending on the residence time distribution, which can be parameterized in terms of streambed morphology, and the ratio between the in-stream concentrations of ammonium and nitrate.

34,34,"Li, AG",Feb 2021 ,Residence Time in Hyporheic Bioactive Layers Explains Nitrate Uptake in Streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization (TASCC) model has been rapidly adopted to interpret in-stream nutrient spiraling metrics over a range of concentrations from breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained during pulse solute injection experiments. TASCC analyses often identify hysteresis in the relationship between spiraling metrics and concentration as nutrient concentration in BTCs rises and falls. The mechanisms behind these hysteresis patterns have yet to be determined. We hypothesized that differences in the time a solute is exposed to bioactive environments (i.e., biophysical opportunity) between the rising and falling limbs of BTCs causes hysteresis in TASCCs. We tested this hypothesis using nitrate data from Elkhorn Creek (CO, USA) combined with a process-based particle-tracking model representing travel times and transformations along each flow path in the water column and hyporheic zone, from which the bioactive zone comprised only a thin superficial layer. In-stream nitrate uptake was controlled by hyporheic exchange and the cumulative time nitrate spend in the bioactive layer. This bioactive residence time generally increased from the rising to the falling limb of the BTC, systematically generating hysteresis in the TASCC curves. Hysteresis decreased when nutrient uptake primarily occurred in the water column compared to the hyporheic zone, and with increasing the distance between the injection and sampling points. Hysteresis increased with the depth of the hyporheic bioactive layer. Our results emphasize that good characterization of spatial heterogeneity of surface-subsurface flow paths and bioactive hot spots within streams is essential to understanding the mechanisms of in-stream nutrient uptake.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000624603200053,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR027646%26rft.atitle%3DResidence%2BTime%2Bin%2BHyporheic%2BBioactive%2BLayers%2BExplains%2BNitrate%2BUptake%2Bin%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAngang%26rft.auinit%3DAG%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR027646%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BAG%26rft.au%3DBernal%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR027646,,"NUTRIENT-UPTAKE,UPTAKE KINETICS,ORGANIC-CARBON,NONSORBING SOLUTES,NITROGEN-RETENTION,SEASONAL-VARIATION,SHINGOBEE RIVER,ROCKY-MOUNTAINS,POROUS BED,DENITRIFICATION",,"Northwestern Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"
35,35,"Qian, Q",Jul 31 2008 ,A vertical dispersion model for solute exchange induced by underflow and periodic hyporheic flow in a stream gravel bed,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Interstitial flows in stream gravel beds are driven by stream slope and controlled by hydraulic conductivity (underflows) or induced by pressure differentials on the streambed surface (hyporheic flows). They enhance solute exchange between surface water and a streambed. To study the solute transport in a stream gravel bed, a 2-D transient advection dispersion mass transfer model was formulated. The velocity field includes an underflow and a spatially periodic hyporheic flow, e. g., due to standing surface waves or bed forms. Two dimensionless scaling parameters emerged: R measures the relative strength of hyporheic flow to underflow in the streambed and l is the ratio of dispersivity of the gravel bed to the pressure wavelength along the streambed. In the analysis of mass transfer of nonconservative substances into a streambed, an explicit 2-D analysis of interstitial flow is often undesirable. Therefore the numerical solutions for the 2-D concentration fields under periodic boundary conditions were reduced to 1-D vertical concentration profiles ( by streamwise averaging of the solute concentrations). The profiles were matched to the solution of an unsteady vertical 1-D dispersion equation that introduces a depth variable ""enhanced dispersion coefficient D(E)(y)'' that lumps all forms of interstitial advective and dispersive transport in the streambed. Functions D(E)(y) were determined for many combinations of independent parameters by inverse modeling, and the dependence of D(E)(y) on the dimensionless parameters R and gimel was determined from these results. Analytical relationships for D(E)(y, R, gimel) have been proposed and validated against available experimental data. Knowledge of D(E)(y) allows the estimation of solute/mass transfer rates in streambeds under wavy boundary conditions, without explicit analysis of the interstitial flow.

36,36,"Uzarski, DG",Jul 1 2001 ,A new chamber design for measuring community metabolism in a Michigan stream,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"We designed an open-ended community metabolism chamber to simultaneously measure surface and hyporheic metabolism. Our chamber design eliminated reaeration, compartmentalized metabolism, maintained ambient conditions and included hyporheic respiration. We compared results from our hyporheic chamber to results obtained from: (1) closed benthic community metabolism chambers constructed as recommended by Bott et al. (1978), and (2) whole-stream metabolism techniques as modified by Marzolf et al. (1994). Simultaneous comparisons of all three procedures were made for a 35 m riffle section of Augusta Creek, a 3rd-order Michigan stream, in July 1997 and repeated in July 1998. Simultaneous comparisons of all three procedures were also made for a 30 m sandy run section of Augusta Creek in September 1997, and repeated in September 1998. Our hyporheic chamber estimates for community respiration (CR24) were similar to those obtained using the whole-stream metabolism procedure but were considerably higher than estimates obtained using the closed benthic chambers in three of the four experiments. These data suggest that our chamber design provided estimates of community metabolism which included both benthic and hyporheic respiration. The chamber incorporates several positive aspects of both closed chambers and the whole-stream method. This new method can be replicated, eliminates the need for a reaeration coefficient, ambient conditions are better approximated since it remains an open system, and it appears to provide more realistic estimates of whole-stream metabolism compared to the traditional chamber approach.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000173247400014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bnew%2Bchamber%2Bdesign%2Bfor%2Bmeasuring%2Bcommunity%2Bmetabolism%2Bin%2Ba%2BMichigan%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DDG%26rft.auinit%3DDG%26rft.aulast%3DUzarski%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1011929719866%26rft.epage%3D155%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D137-155%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D137%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D455%26rft.au%3DUzarski%252C%2BDG%26rft.au%3DBurton%252C%2BTM%26rft.au%3DStricker%252C%2BCA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1023/A:1011929719866,"stream metabolism,metabolism chamber,whole-stream metabolism,hyporheic respiration,P/R,primary productivity","OXYGEN CHANGE TECHNIQUE,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,SURFACE-WATER,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,NUTRIENT DYNAMICS,CURRENT VELOCITY,MOUNTAIN STREAM",,"Michigan State Univ, Dept Zool, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA"

The activity of hyporheic microorganisms plays a key role in these processes, as they are able to oxidize and reduce organic matter and nutrients. The interplay between the residence times in the hyporheic zone and the temporal scales of the microbial reactions must thus be understood in order to improve our understanding of the role of fluvial environments in nutrient cycling. In this paper we focus on the intrameander hyporheic region and investigate the links between river morphology, hyporheic flow field, and biogeochemical processes. We adopt a modeling framework that considers the planimetric evolution of a meandering river, the hyporheic flow field induced by the river sinuosity, and the main biogeochemical reactions of organic carbon degradation. The chemical zonation of the intrameander hyporheic zone clearly emerges as a result of the coupling between hyporheic flow and biochemical activity. The resulting patterns of nutrient concentrations are strongly influenced by the river morphology. We also show how to estimate the characteristic timescales of the redox reactions and that their interplay with the kinematic timescales of the hyporheic flow controls both the biochemical zonation and the overall rate of nutrient transformation.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000274466600002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW02511%26rft.atitle%3DBiogeochemical%2Bzonation%2Bdue%2Bto%2Bintrameander%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%26rft.aufirst%3DF.%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DBoano%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007583%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DBoano%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DDemaria%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DRidolfi%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2008WR007583,,"NITRATE USE,STREAM,TRANSPORT,EXCHANGE,SOLUTES,RIVER,CHEMISTRY,GEOMETRY,MEANDER,MODEL",,"Politecn Torino, Dept Hydraul Transports & Civil Infrastruct, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy"
38,38,"Harjung, A",Jan 2018 ,Hydrological connectivity drives dissolved organic matter processing in an intermittent stream,LIMNOLOGICA,"Hydrological conditions are key drivers of dissolved organic matter (DOM) processing in intermittent streams. However, there still exist major gaps in knowledge regarding the temporal dynamics of DOM processing during drought periods, as well as the role of the hyporheic zone (HZ). We conducted weekly sampling of surface water and hyporheic pore water during a drying/rewetting cycle and characterized DOM by fluorescence and absorbance properties. Overall, the contribution of allochthonous and humic-like DOM increased during base flow in early summer (pre-drought) and continued increasing throughout the drought period, which covered three phases: contraction, fragmentation and dry. The contribution of autochthonous DOM during this period was restricted to very specific points in time (the transition from contraction to fragmentation phase) and space (the HZ). Hydrological connectivity between the HZ and the surface water was a driver of DOM composition by supplying terrestrial, aromatic DOM to the HZ. The disconnection of the stream from the riparian groundwater enabled us to quantify the DOM retention/release in the HZ. DOM mass balance at the stream-hyporheic interface revealed the occurrence of two time periods with disproportionately high rates for DOM processing (hot moments) during the study period: (1) a short pulse of protein-like, autochthonous DOM net release at the beginning of the disconnection; and (2) a longer time period of increasing net dissolved organic carbon (DOC) retention up to 30% along 25 m of HZ length during fragmentation and dry phase. Remarkably, the net carbon retention was coupled to a decrease of aromatic and high molecular weight compounds, while protein-like, autochthonous DOM was released. This result evidenced that under drought conditions, the HZ becomes a sink for DOM compounds previously assumed to be recalcitrant in aquatic ecosystems and therefore highlights the importance of hydrological drivers on DOM processing.

39,39,"Mueller, BM",Feb 18 2021 ,Simultaneous attenuation of trace organics and change in organic matter composition in the hyporheic zone of urban streams,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Trace organic compounds (TrOCs) enter rivers with discharge of treated wastewater. These effluents can contain high loads of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In a 48 h field study, we investigated changes in molecular composition of seven DOM compound classes (FTICR-MS) and attenuation of 17 polar TrOCs in a small urban stream receiving treated wastewater. Correlations between TrOCs and DOM were used to identify simultaneous changes in surface water and the hyporheic zone. Changes in TrOC concentrations in surface water ranged between a decrease of 29.2% for methylbenzotriazole and an increase of 152.2% for the transformation product gabapentin-lactam. In the hyporheic zone, only decreasing TrOC concentrations were observed, ranging from 4.9% for primidone to 93.8% for venlafaxine . TrOC attenuation coincided with a decline of molecular diversity of easily biodegradable DOM compound classes while molecular diversity of poorly biodegradable DOM compound classes increased. This concurrence indicates similar or linked attenuation pathways for biodegradable DOM and TrOCs. Strong correlations between TrOCs and DOM compound classes as well as high attenuation of TrOCs primarily occurred in the hyporheic zone. This suggests high potential for DOM turnover and TrOC mitigation in rivers if hyporheic exchange is sufficient.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000621416400052,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B4179%26rft.atitle%3DSimultaneous%2Battenuation%2Bof%2Btrace%2Borganics%2Band%2Bchange%2Bin%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bcomposition%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Burban%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DBirgit%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DBM%26rft.aulast%3DMueller%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41598-021-83750-8%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2045-2322%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENTIFIC%2BREPORTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BREP-UK%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DMueller%252C%2BBM%26rft.au%3DSchulz%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=SCIENTIFIC+REPORTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1038/s41598-021-83750-8,,"PRIMARY SUBSTRATE COMPOSITION,SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION,MICROBIAL COMMUNITY,PHARMACEUTICALS,CHEMICALS,REMOVAL,CARBON,CONTAMINANTS,DOM,BIODEGRADABILITY",,"Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecohydrol, Mueggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany"

41,41,"Mojarrad, BB",Jan 2023 ,Convergence of Groundwater Discharge through the Hyporheic Zone of Streams,GROUNDWATER,"Significant attention has been given to hyporheic water fluxes induced by hydromorphologic processes in streambeds and the effects they have on stream ecology. However, the impact of hyporheic fluxes on regional groundwater flow discharge zones as well as the interaction of these flows are much less investigated. The groundwater-hyporheic interactive flow not only governs solute mass and heat transport in streams but also controls the retention of solute and contamination following the discharge of deep groundwater, such as naturally occurring solutes and leakage from geological waste disposal facilities. Here, we applied a physically based modeling approach combined with extensive hydrologic, geologic and geographical data to investigate the effect of hyporheic flow on groundwater discharge in the Krycklan catchment, located in a boreal landscape in Sweden. Regional groundwater modeling was conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics by considering geologic heterogeneity and infiltration constraint of the groundwater circulation intensity. Moreover, the hyporheic flow was analyzed using an exact spectral solution accounting for the fluctuating streambed topography and superimposed with the regional groundwater flow. By comparing the discharge flow fields with and without consideration of hyporheic flows, we found that the divergence of the discharge was substantially enhanced and the distribution of the travel times of groundwater was significantly shifted toward shorter times due to the presence of hyporheic flow. Particularly important is that the groundwater flow paths contract near the streambed interface due to the hyporheic flow, which leads to a phenomenon that we name ""fragmentation"" of coherent areas of groundwater upwelling in pinhole-shaped stream tubes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000841852900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConvergence%2Bof%2BGroundwater%2BDischarge%2Bthrough%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bof%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DBrian%2BBabak%26rft.auinit%3DBB%26rft.aulast%3DMojarrad%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.13236%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D85%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D66-85%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D66%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D61%26rft.au%3DMojarrad%252C%2BBB%26rft.au%3DWorman%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BSL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gwat.13236,,"SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,FLOW,IMPACT,EXCHANGE,TRANSPORT,TOPOGRAPHY,REPOSITORY",,"KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden"
42,42,"Ren, J",Jun 2019 ,Using water temperature series and hydraulic heads to quantify hyporheic exchange in the riparian zone,HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"Surface-water/groundwater exchange through the evaluation of riparian-zone temperature data has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The Fox Ditch Canal, Nevada, USA, was chosen for this study on seasonal variations of riparian-zone water exchange. Groundwater temperature and hydraulic head real-time monitoring data were collected from March to November 2012. A calibrated hydro-thermal coupling model was used to characterize the riparian-zone temporal and spatial temperature distribution, thereby providing a standard against which the performances of four analytical solution models for calculated riparian-zone vertical seepage velocity could be assessed. The results indicated that the proposed model provided a simulation that was able to represent dynamic changes in riparian-zone soil temperature. Although small variations in patterns and magnitudes of riparian-zone water exchange were evident at a daily scale, they varied significantly over a seasonal scale. Comparison of the results of the four analytical solutions and numerical computation found that the Hatch solution by the amplitude method provided the highest accuracy for calculating groundwater velocity in this area (2.47x10(-6) to 3.15x10(-6) m/s). Global sensitivity analysis of hydro-thermal coupling model parameters showed that porosity had the most significant impact on temperature in the model.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000468592900019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2Bwater%2Btemperature%2Bseries%2Band%2Bhydraulic%2Bheads%2Bto%2Bquantify%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bthe%2Briparian%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-019-01934-z%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D1437%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1419-1437%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1419%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BWB%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BYJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-019-01934-z,"Hyporheic exchange,Riparian zone,Analytical solutions,Vertical seepage velocity,Groundwater,surface-water relations","GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,FLUID-FLOW,RIVER,SURFACE,TRACER,STREAM,DIFFUSIVITY,ADVECTION,SEDIMENT,EQUATION",,"Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China"
43,43,"Poole, GC",Jun 2006 ,Multiscale geomorphic drivers of groundwater flow paths: subsurface hydrologic dynamics and hyporheic habitat diversity,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Application of a hydrogeologic computer model underscored the importance of geomorphic controls on groundwater and surface-water flow dynamics in the Nyack Floodplain, a montane alluvial floodplain in Montana, USA. The model represented the floodplain as a hierarchy of geomorphic patches, which facilitated analysis of model results using independent (predictor) variables at multiple scales. The analyses revealed that geomorphic structures at various spatial scales interact with the flow regime to influence the direction, magnitude, and stability of hyporheic flow within individual floodplain patches. Specifically: 1) the hydrologic flow network within the hyporheic zone is more responsive to seasonal changes in river discharge if floodplain topography is complex and aquifer properties are heterogeneous, 2) simplification of internal patch structure across the floodplain eliminates the influence of fine-scale geomorphic structures on the stability of groundwater flow paths, although the influence of patch context remains, and 3) incremental changes in river discharge can abruptly and substantially restructure the relationship between river discharge and groundwater flow patterns when events such as inundation of previously dry flood channels occur on the floodplain. We believe that ecological theories of biodiversity can be used to understand interactions among geomorphic variation, hydrologic dynamics, and the maintenance of biodiversity in the hyporheic zone if abrupt reorganization and other variations in groundwater flow paths act as disturbances to hyporheic communities. From this perspective, we used model results to develop 4 hypotheses describing the potential for causal linkages among floodplain geomorphology, hyporheic flow-path variation, hyporheic habitat diversity/stability, and hyporheic community diversity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000237891600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMultiscale%2Bgeomorphic%2Bdrivers%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%2Bflow%2Bpaths%253A%2Bsubsurface%2Bhydrologic%2Bdynamics%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bhabitat%2Bdiversity%26rft.aufirst%3DGeoffrey%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DGC%26rft.aulast%3DPoole%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F0887-3593%25282006%252925%255B288%253AMGDOGF%255D2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D303%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D288-303%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D288%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DPoole%252C%2BGC%26rft.au%3DStanford%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DFrissell%252C%2BCA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1899/0887-3593(2006)25[288:MGDOGF]2.0.CO;2,"hyporheic flow patterns,geomorphology,river flow regime,hydrologic modeling,fluvial landscape,groundwater,biological diversity","SONORAN DESERT STREAM,RIVER ECOSYSTEMS,WATER EXCHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,GLACIAL FLOODPLAIN,SEASONAL-VARIATION,GRAVEL-BED,ZONE,PATTERNS,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY",,"Ecometrics Inc, 2520 Pine Lake Rd, Tucker, GA 30084 USA"
44,44,"Holmes, RM",May 1996 ,Denitrification in a nitrogen-limited stream ecosystem,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Denitrification was measured in hyporheic, parafluvial, and bank sediments of Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a nitrogen-limited Sonoran Desert stream. We used three variations of the acetylene block technique to estimate denitrification rates, and compared these estimates to rates of nitrate production through nitrification. Subsurface sediments of Sycamore Creek are typically well-oxygenated, relatively low in nitrate, and low in organic carbon, and therefore are seemingly unlikely sites of denitrification. However, we found that denitrification potential (C & N amended, anaerobic incubations) was substantial, and even by our conservative estimates (unamended, oxic incubations and field chamber nitrous oxide accumulation), denitrification consumed 5-40% of nitrate produced by nitrification. We expected that denitrification would increase along hyporheic and parafluvial flowpaths as dissolved oxygen declined and nitrate increased. To the contrary, we found that denitrification was generally highest at the upstream ends of subsurface flowpaths where surface water had just entered the subsurface zone. This suggests that denitrifiers may be dependent on the import of surface-derived organic matter, resulting in highest denitrification rate at locations of surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange. Laboratory experiments showed that denitrification in Sycamore Creek sediments was primarily nitrogen limited and secondarily carbon limited, and was temperature dependent. Overall, the quantity of nitrate removed from the Sycamore Creek ecosystem via denitrification is significant given the nitrogen-limited status of this stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1996UT83200003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDenitrification%2Bin%2Ba%2Bnitrogen-limited%2Bstream%2Becosystem%26rft.aufirst%3DRM%26rft.auinit%3DRM%26rft.aulast%3DHolmes%26rft.date%3D1996%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF02181035%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D146%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D125-146%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D125%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D33%26rft.au%3DHolmes%252C%2BRM%26rft.au%3DJones%252C%2BJB%26rft.au%3DGrimm%252C%2BNB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/BF02181035,"denitrification,stream ecology,nutrient dynamics,nitrification,hyporheic zone,parafluvial zone","HYPORHEIC ZONE,SEASONAL-VARIATION,NITRATE,EXCHANGE,METABOLISM,PARAMETERS,INHIBITION,ACETYLENE,REDUCTION,LOSSES",,
45,45,"Boyraz, U",2014 ,An investigation on the effect of geometric shape of streams on stream/ground water interactions and ground water flow,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,"Ground water should be used efficiently and improved for sustainable water management plans. For this purpose, comprehensive ground water flow models are developed incorporating surface/ground water interactions. Typically, these models require a significant amount of hydrological parameters and the sensitivities of these parameters on interaction mechanisms need to be clarified. Therefore, in this study, the role of the geometric shape of the stream on stream/ground water interactions is investigated. First, an analytical solution for two-dimensional ground water flow is developed with sloping stream boundary in an isotropic and homogeneous aquifer. Then, ground water head distribution and hyporheic exchange flow between stream and aquifer are obtained by conducting sensitivity analyses with prototype models developed using Visual MODular Finite-Difference FLOW in order to observe individual effects of each stream property. Finally, by incorporating the highest possible stream/ground water interaction conditions into a conceptual stream-aquifer model, the combined effects of different stream shapes are interpreted. Results show that slope, abrupt slope change, and flow path of stream affect the interactions significantly. Moreover, interaction flow rates increase further under the combined effects of these stream properties. The outputs of this work will ultimately be used in site investigations and in forecasting ground water hydrology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000341061400007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2Binvestigation%2Bon%2Bthe%2Beffect%2Bof%2Bgeometric%2Bshape%2Bof%2Bstreams%2Bon%2Bstream%252Fground%2Bwater%2Binteractions%2Band%2Bground%2Bwater%2Bflow%26rft.aufirst%3DUgur%26rft.auinit%3DU%26rft.aulast%3DBoyraz%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fnh.2013.057%26rft.eissn%3D2224-7955%26rft.epage%3D588%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1998-9563%26rft.issue%3D4-5%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D575-588%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D575%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DBoyraz%252C%2BU%26rft.au%3DKazezyilmaz-Alhan%252C%2BCM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/nh.2013.057,"analytical solution,conceptual models,hyporheic exchange flow,MODFLOW,stream-aquifer region,stream/ground water interactions","AQUIFER INTERACTIONS,SIMULATION,MODFLOW",,"Istanbul Univ, Dept Civil Engn, POB 34320, Istanbul, Turkey"
46,46,"Li, AG",Aug 2017 ,Covariation in patterns of turbulence-driven hyporheic flow and denitrification enhances reach-scale nitrogen removal,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Coinjections of conservative tracers and nutrients are commonly used to assess travel time distributions and nutrient removal in streams. However, in-stream tracer data often lack information on long-term hyporheic storage, and removal rate coefficients are often assumed to be uniform despite plentiful evidence that microbially mediated transformations, such as denitrification, exhibit strong spatial variability in the hyporheic zone. We used process-based particle-tracking simulations to explore the coupled effects of spatial patterns in hyporheic flow and denitrification on reach-scale nitrogen removal. We simulated whole-stream nitrogen dynamics with exponential, layered, and uniform profiles of hyporheic denitrification. We also simulated nitrogen dynamics in Little Rabbit Creek, an agricultural headwater stream in the Kalamazoo River Basin (Michigan, USA) where vertical profiles of hyporheic denitrification were measured in situ. Covariation between pore water velocity and mixing causes rapid exchange in the near-surface bioactive region and substantially prolonged exchange in the deeper hyporheic. Patterns of hyporheic denitrification covary with patterns of hyporheic flow. This covariation directly controls tailing of in-stream breakthrough curves and hence reach-scale nutrient removal. Enhanced denitrification near the sediment-water interface strongly tempers breakthrough curve tails at time scales associated with flushing of the near-surface region, while more spatially uniform denitrification causes weaker tempering over a wider range of hyporheic exchange time scales. At the reach scale, overall nitrogen removal increases with heterogeneity of hyporheic denitrification, indicating that covariation between flow and denitrificationparticularly the rapid flushing of highly bioactive regions near the sediment-water interfacecontrols whole-stream transformation rates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000411202000032,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCovariation%2Bin%2Bpatterns%2Bof%2Bturbulence-driven%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Band%2Bdenitrification%2Benhances%2Breach-scale%2Bnitrogen%2Bremoval%26rft.aufirst%3DAngang%26rft.auinit%3DAG%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019949%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6944%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6927-6944%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6927%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BAG%26rft.au%3DAubeneau%252C%2BAF%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR019949,,"STREAM-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,WALK PARTICLE TRACKING,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,TRANSIENT STORAGE,NUTRIENT-UPTAKE,MOUNTAIN STREAM,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,RESIDENCE TIME,SEDIMENT BEDS",,"Northwestern Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"
47,47,"STANLEY, EH",Jul 1995 ,HYPORHEIC PROCESSES DURING FLOODING AND DRYING IN A SONORAN DESERT STREAM .1. HYDROLOGIC AND CHEMICAL-DYNAMICS,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"We examined the effects of flooding and prolonged drying on interstitial water chemistry in the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran Desert stream at three sites with different flow regimens. Sampling began immediately after a winter flood rewetted the previously dry stream, and ended when a summer flash flood destroyed many sampling wells 170 days later. Nitrate-N, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and dissolved oxygen concentrations were high whereas ammonium-N was low at all sites at the beginning of the study period. As discharge declined and drying began, nutrient and dissolved oxygen concentrations declined in phreatic (> 50 cm deep) and parafluvial (lateral to the active channel) subsystems while shallow hyporheic (< 50 cm) samples remained well-oxygenated. Hyporheic water chemistry in areas lacking surface flow (the dry channel hyporheic) varied between sites; nitrate-N and dissolved oxygen decreased at one site but increased at another. With continued drying, phreatic and parafluvial habitats became extremely hypoxic (< 0.50 mg/L dissolved oxygen) and low in nitrate-N (< 0.02 mg/L) due to reduced hydrologic exchange between surface and hyporheic waters. The increased area of hypoxia apparently enhanced nitrate-reducing transformations in phreatic and parafluvial habitats because interstitial nitrate-N concentrations often were lower than surface values; thus, drying caused a functional shift in this N-limited stream as the hyporheic zone changed from a nitrate source to a nitrate sink. Boundaries of hyporheic subsystems fluctuated considerably in response to flooding and drying, underscoring the importance of hydrologic extremes to the strength of chemical linkages between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1995RJ33500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHYPORHEIC%2BPROCESSES%2BDURING%2BFLOODING%2BAND%2BDRYING%2BIN%2BA%2BSONORAN%2BDESERT%2BSTREAM%2B.1.%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BAND%2BCHEMICAL-DYNAMICS%26rft.aufirst%3DEH%26rft.auinit%3DEH%26rft.aulast%3DSTANLEY%26rft.date%3D1995%26rft.epage%3D26%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1-26%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D134%26rft.au%3DSTANLEY%252C%2BEH%26rft.au%3DBOULTON%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,,"SURFACE-WATER,ZONE,EXCHANGE,ECOLOGY,PERSPECTIVE,PATTERNS,RIVER",,

Given that the frequency and duration of stream drying events is likely to increase as a result of anthropogenic pressures and global climate change, riverbed sediments may become increasingly important as refuge habitat for benthic macroinvertebrates. Our study examined the effect of surface water loss and increasing drying duration on the survivorship of the most abundant benthic invertebrate, Gammarus pulex (L.) (Amphipoda: Gammaridae), inhabiting the wet subsurface sediments of exposed gravel bars within a perennial stream and a connected temporarily flowing side channel. G. pulex survivorship declined more over time during drying conditions compared to control conditions (flowing water present). Survivorship was greater in the temporary channel and may reflect the greater water retention capacity of fine sediments in the subsurface and abiotic stability compared to the free-draining exposed gravel bars on the main channel. Our results illustrate that saturated subsurface sediments may facilitate G. pulex persistence during surface drying events and highlight the need for effective refuge management and conservation for instream fauna during drying events.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000427883100010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDrying%2Bduration%2Band%2Bstream%2Bcharacteristics%2Binfluence%2Bmacroinvertebrate%2Bsurvivorship%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Bsediments%2Bof%2Ba%2Btemporary%2Bchannel%2Band%2Bexposed%2Bgravel%2Bbars%2Bof%2Ba%2Bconnected%2Bperennial%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DAtish%2BN.%26rft.auinit%3DAN%26rft.aulast%3DVadher%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-018-3544-9%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D132%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D121-132%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D121%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D814%26rft.au%3DVadher%252C%2BAN%26rft.au%3DMillett%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DWood%252C%2BPJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C934DBaBOmaBFvAACNzVIP&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-018-3544-9,"Intermittent river,Streambed drying,Dry period,Hyporheic refuge,Faunal survival,Gammarus pulex","ALTERED FLOW REGIMES,GAMMARUS-PULEX,INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,HEADWATER STREAMS,HYPORHEIC ZONE,WATER-QUALITY,BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES,INTERSTITIAL HABITAT,INTERMITTENT RIVERS,SUMMER DROUGHTS",,"Loughborough Univ Technol, Ctr Hydrol & Ecosyst Sci, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England"
