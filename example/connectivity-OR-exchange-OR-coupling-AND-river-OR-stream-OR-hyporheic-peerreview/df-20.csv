1,"Mustafa, M",Sep 2018 ,Modeling Landscape Change Effects on Stream Temperature Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool,WATER,"Stream temperature is one of the most important factors for regulating fish behavior and habitat. Therefore, models that seek to characterize stream temperatures, and predict their changes due to landscape and climatic changes, are extremely important. In this study, we extend a mechanistic stream temperature model within the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) by explicitly incorporating radiative flux components to more realistically account for radiative heat exchange. The extended stream temperature model is particularly useful for simulating the impacts of landscape and land use change on stream temperatures using SWAT. The extended model is tested for the Marys River, a western tributary of the Willamette River in Oregon. The results are compared with observed stream temperatures, as well as previous model estimates (without radiative components), for different spatial locations within the Marys River watershed. The results show that the radiative stream temperature model is able to simulate increased stream temperatures in agricultural sub-basins compared with forested sub-basins, reflecting observed data. However, the effect is overestimated, and more noise is generated in the radiative model due to the inclusion of highly variable radiative forcing components. The model works at a daily time step, and further research should investigate modeling at hourly timesteps to further improve the temporal resolution of the model. In addition, other watersheds should be tested to improve and validate the model in different climates, landscapes, and land use regimes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000448821900035,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1143%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2BLandscape%2BChange%2BEffects%2Bon%2BStream%2BTemperature%2BUsing%2Bthe%2BSoil%2Band%2BWater%2BAssessment%2BTool%26rft.aufirst%3DMamoon%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DMustafa%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw10091143%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DMustafa%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DBarnhart%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DFicklin%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

3,"Mathers, KL",Jun 2017 ,Benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate distribution within the heads and tails of riffles during baseflow conditions,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The distribution of lotic fauna is widely acknowledged to be patchy reflecting the interaction between biotic and abiotic factors. In an in situ field study, the distribution of benthic and hyporheic invertebrates in the heads (downwelling) and tails (upwelling) of riffles were examined during stable baseflow conditions. Riffle heads were found to contain a greater proportion of interstitial fine sediment than riffle tails. Significant differences in the composition of benthic communities were associated with the amount of fine sediment. Riffle tail habitats supported a greater abundance and diversity of invertebrates sensitive to fine sediment such as EPT taxa. Shredder feeding taxa were more abundant in riffle heads suggesting greater availability of organic matter. In contrast, no significant differences in the hyporheic community were recorded between riffle heads and tails. We hypothesise that clogging of hyporheic interstices with fine sediments may have resulted in the homogenisation of the invertebrate community by limiting faunal movement into the hyporheic zone at both the riffle heads and tails. The results suggest that vertical hydrological exchange significantly influences the distribution of fine sediment and macroinvertebrate communities at the riffle scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000401474400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBenthic%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bmacroinvertebrate%2Bdistribution%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Bheads%2Band%2Btails%2Bof%2Briffles%2Bduring%2Bbaseflow%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DKate%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DKL%26rft.aulast%3DMathers%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-017-3092-8%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D30%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D17-30%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D17%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D794%26rft.au%3DMathers%252C%2BKL%26rft.au%3DHill%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DWood%252C%2BPJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Zeinali, M",Jan 2020 ,Simulating Unsaturated Zone of Soil for Estimating the Recharge Rate and Flow Exchange Between a River and an Aquifer,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"Coupling surface water and groundwater models dynamically based on a simultaneous simulation of saturated and unsaturated zones of soil is a useful method for determining the recharge rate and flow exchange between a river and an aquifer as well as simultaneous operation of water resources systems. Thus, the main objectives of this study are to investigate the effects of surface water and groundwater interactions through their systematic simulation and to create a dynamic coupling between surface water and groundwater resources of the area by relevant mathematical models. Accordingly, hydrologic soil moisture method and MODFLOW model were employed to simulate the unsaturated and saturated zones, respectively. The results revealed that simultaneous simulation of the saturated and unsaturated zones of the soil can illustrate the interaction between surface water and groundwater at any spatial and temporal intervals well through using complete hydroclimatological balance components in the form of a coupled model. The application of this method in the Loor-Andimeshk Plain, located in the southwest of Iran, showed that aquifer recharge through the plain area from November to March is due to precipitation. On the other hand, in the warm months (June to September), the plain is merely fed through irrigation water penetration. As the level of river water in both Dez and Balarood rivers is higher than the Loor-Andimeshk aquifer level, hence the exchange occurs as a leakage from the river to the aquifer. The highest and lowest values of average exchangeable water in Balarood River occur in March and April and in Dez River are from June to September.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000505331800002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSimulating%2BUnsaturated%2BZone%2Bof%2BSoil%2Bfor%2BEstimating%2Bthe%2BRecharge%2BRate%2Band%2BFlow%2BExchange%2BBetween%2Ba%2BRiver%2Band%2Ban%2BAquifer%26rft.aufirst%3DMasoomeh%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DZeinali%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-019-02458-7%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1650%26rft.epage%3D443%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D425-443%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D425%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DZeinali%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DAzari%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DHeidari%252C%2BMM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"Jimenez-Fernandez, O",Feb 2022 ,Groundwater-surface water exchange as key control for instream and groundwater nitrate concentrations along a first-order agricultural stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Lower-order streams (first- and second-order) define the initial, landscape-related, chemical signature of stream water in catchments. To date, first-order streams have been perceived as predominantly draining systems, which collect water and solutes from the surrounding groundwater and surface runoff and simply mirror the chemical composition of the inputs. In this study, the impact of stream-groundwater exchange fluxes on water chemistry of a first order agricultural stream (Schonbrunnen) and its connected groundwater in south-western Germany was assessed combining Rn-222, dissolved ions (chloride, sulphate, nitrate), and salt tracer tests with investigations of stream discharge and groundwater hydraulic gradients. The findings suggest that stream-water chemistry in lower-order streams is governed by an intricate interplay between dynamic, bidirectional water and solute exchange between groundwater and the stream leading to a pronounced hydrologic turnover along the studied reaches. High nitrate concentrations (up to 79 mg/L as NO3-) in stream water were attenuated in downstream direction (a mean value of 39 mg/L) without an increase in discharge, suggesting that redox processes occurring during sediment passage in sequential infiltration and exfiltration zones affect stream water chemistry. Nitrate in stream water infiltrating into the aquifer at distinct losing spots was subject to denitrification within the first few decimetres of the streambed, while concurrent exfiltration of low-nitrate groundwater into the stream at gaining spots compensated for flow losses and in turn diluted instream nitrate concentrations. In summary the findings imply that (1) instream mixing resulting from the bidirectional exchange of water between groundwater and the stream (hydrologic turnover) affects instream nitrate concentrations, (2) denitrification in the streambed of losing reaches and the near-stream aquifer significantly contributes to reactive nitrate turnover and elimination, and (3) oxidation of ammonium could be a secondary source of nitrate inputs into the stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000760417000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14507%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bas%2Bkey%2Bcontrol%2Bfor%2Binstream%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bnitrate%2Bconcentrations%2Balong%2Ba%2Bfirst-order%2Bagricultural%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DOscar%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DJimenez-Fernandez%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14507%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DJimenez-Fernandez%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DSchwientek%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DFleckenstein%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
6,"Norton, SA",Sep 2000 ,Response of a first-order stream in Maine to short-term in-stream acidification,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"An experimental short-term acidification with HCl at a first-order stream in central Maine, USA was used to study processes controlling the changes in stream chemistry and to assess the ability of stream substrate to buffer pH. The streambed exerted a strong buffering capacity against pH change by ion exchange during the 6-hour acidification. Streambed substrates had substantial cation and anion exchange capacity in the pH range of 4.1 to 6.5. The ion exchange for cations and SO42- were rapid and reversible. The speed of release of cations from stream substrates was Na1+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Aln+ > Be2+, perhaps relating to charge density of these cations. Ca2+ desorption dominated neutralisation of excess H+ for the first 2 hr. As the reservoir of exchangeable Ca diminished, desorption land possibly dissolution) of Al3+ became the dominant neutralising mechanism. The exchangeable land possibly soluble) reservoir of Al was not depleted during the 6-hour acidification. Sulphate adsorption during the acidification reduced the concentration of SO42- in stream water by as much as 20 mu eq L-1 (from 70 mu eq L-1). Desorption of SO42- and adsorption of base cat ions after the artificial acidification resulted in a prolongation of the pH depression. The streambed had the capacity to buffer stream water chemistry significantly during an acidifying event affecting the entire upstream catchment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000167826900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DResponse%2Bof%2Ba%2Bfirst-order%2Bstream%2Bin%2BMaine%2Bto%2Bshort-term%2Bin-stream%2Bacidification%26rft.aufirst%3DSA%26rft.auinit%3DSA%26rft.aulast%3DNorton%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-4-383-2000%26rft.epage%3D391%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D383-391%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D383%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D4%26rft.au%3DNorton%252C%2BSA%26rft.au%3DWagai%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DRissberger%252C%2BFA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
7,"Teitelbaum, Y",Apr 2021 ,Dynamics of Hyporheic Exchange Flux and Fine Particle Deposition Under Moving Bedforms,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Deposition of fine suspended particles can reduce hyporheic exchange flux (HEF), which may result in impairment of various ecological processes. However, the dynamics of fine particle deposition and streambed clogging are still not well understood, especially when the bed is in motion. We conducted flume experiments to study the effects of coupled sand-clay dynamics on HEF with episodic (pulse) inputs of suspended kaolinite. Three experiments with a mobile sand bed and constant discharge were conducted with repeated injection of suspended kaolinite pulses at fixed concentration increments of 0.16, 0.41, and 0.66 g/L, respectively. HEF and participating porewater volume were assessed using tracer tests. Kaolinite deposition rates were inferred from turbidity measurements while deposition patterns were measured using core samples. We found that fine sediment primarily accumulated within a layer below the bedform scour zone, and that this layer was thicker when kaolinite was added in larger pulses. HEF declined linearly over time as kaolinite accumulated in the bed sediment; an increase of 0.1% kaolinite in the bed led to a decrease in HEF of 26.6 cm/day, regardless of the pulse concentration. However, the same kaolinite increase led to a reduction of 50% in participating pore volume for larger kaolinite pulses, versus only 30% for the smallest pulse. These results indicate that clogging occurs not just during and after high-flow events, but also under constant flow conditions in which episodic deposition of suspended clay by HEF leads to the formation of a low-conductivity layer in the bed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000644063800063,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028541%26rft.atitle%3DDynamics%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BFlux%2Band%2BFine%2BParticle%2BDeposition%2BUnder%2BMoving%2BBedforms%26rft.aufirst%3DYoni%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DTeitelbaum%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028541%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DTeitelbaum%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DDallmann%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DArnon%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
8,"Andersen, DC",Jun 2018 ,"Flood effects on soil thermal regimes in contrasting cold-desert river floodplains (Yampa and Green rivers, Colorado)",ECOHYDROLOGY,"Heat transfer theory suggests that floodplain soils in dryland riverine ecosystems can be cooled by hyporheic flows generated during spring floods. I compared soil temperature cycles and associated hydrologic factors on a free-flowing river to those on a river where flows and surface water temperatures are now regulated. Spring surface water temperatures were comparable on the 2 rivers, as was apparent diffusivity of the soil under mature Populus fremontii in a year when severe drought produced similar soil moisture regimes. Over 9years of monitoring, mean annual maximum soil temperature was higher on the regulated river than on the free-flowing river (10cm depth: 33 vs. 23 degrees C; 40cm depth: 30 vs. 20 degrees C, respectively), and sinusoidal models of the annual temperature cycle at each depth indicated higher means and greater amplitudes on the regulated river. The annual maximum soil temperature was inversely related to peak flood discharge on the free-flowing river but not on the regulated river. Temporal shifts in the lag between diel cycles at 40 and 10cm depthsan index of soil thermal diffusivitysuggested that the capillary fringe is strongly involved in heat exchange. An increase in the lag during some water table declines suggested that shallow soils may undergo flood-induced evaporative cooling. Hyporheic recharge can be an ecologically important determinant of growing-season soil temperatures at plant rooting depth in dryland river floodplains. Reductions in spring flood magnitude due to river regulation, water abstraction, or climate change can increase these temperatures and thereby alter ecosystem structure and functioning.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434219200005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be1939%26rft.atitle%3DFlood%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bsoil%2Bthermal%2Bregimes%2Bin%2Bcontrasting%2Bcold-desert%2Briver%2Bfloodplains%2B%2528Yampa%2Band%2BGreen%2Brivers%252C%2BColorado%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DDouglas%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DDC%26rft.aulast%3DAndersen%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Feco.1939%26rft.eissn%3D1936-0592%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1936-0584%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DECOHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOHYDROLOGY%26rft.volume%3D11&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=ECOHYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
9,"Briggs, MA",Jun 16 2015 ,A physical explanation for the development of redox microzones in hyporheic flow,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Recent observations reveal a paradox of anaerobic respiration occurring in seemingly oxic-saturated sediments. Here we demonstrate a residence time-based explanation for this paradox. Specifically, we show how microzones favorable to anaerobic respiration processes (e.g., denitrification, metal reduction, and methanogenesis) can develop in the embedded less mobile porosity of bulk-oxic hyporheic zones. Anoxic microzones develop when transport time from the streambed to the pore center exceeds a characteristic uptake time of oxygen. A two-dimensional pore-network model was used to quantify how anoxic microzones develop across a range of hyporheic flow and oxygen uptake conditions. Two types of microzones develop: flow invariant and flow dependent. The former is stable across variable hydrologic conditions, whereas the formation and extent of the latter are sensitive to flow rate and orientation. Therefore, pore-scale residence time heterogeneity, which can now be evaluated in situ, offers a simple explanation for anaerobic signals occurring in oxic pore waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000357511200020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bphysical%2Bexplanation%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bdevelopment%2Bof%2Bredox%2Bmicrozones%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%26rft.aufirst%3DMartin%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DBriggs%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015GL064200%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D4410%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4402-4410%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4402%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DBriggs%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DDay-Lewis%252C%2BFD%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

From a Multiple Streams perspective, local corona hotspots may be understood as policy windows for introducing respective measures. However, this alone is not sufficient to explain agenda setting. This study investigates the coupling of streams within policy windows. Introducing the notion of relational coupling to the MSF research agenda, discourse network analysis provides a new methodology to reveal entrepreneurial activities. Studying the German mass media discourse on the issue identifies two stages: (1) An initial problem brokerage without coupling of core policies, followed by (2) a coupling across all streams based on a focusing event. We argue that relational coupling allows for an enhanced understanding of agenda setting.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000761881500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRelational%2Bcoupling%2Bof%2Bmultiple%2Bstreams%253A%2BThe%2Bcase%2Bof%2BCOVID-19%2Binfections%2Bin%2BGerman%2Babattoirs%2528sic%2529%2528sic%2529%2528sic%2529Palabras%2Bclave%26rft.aufirst%3DMalte%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DMoeck%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fpsj.12459%26rft.eissn%3D1541-0072%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0190-292X%26rft.jtitle%3DPOLICY%2BSTUDIES%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DPOLICY%2BSTUD%2BJ%26rft.au%3DMock%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DVogeler%252C%2BCS%26rft.au%3DHornung%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=POLICY+STUDIES+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
11,"Li, YP",Nov 2002 ,Air-sea interactions during the passage of a winter storm over the Gulf Stream: A three-dimensional coupled atmosphere-ocean model study,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,"[1] A three-dimensional, regional coupled atmosphere-ocean model with full physics is developed to study air-sea interactions during winter storms off the U. S. east coast. Because of the scarcity of open ocean observations, models such as this offer valuable opportunities to investigate how oceanic forcing drives atmospheric circulation and vice versa. The study presented here considers conditions of strong atmospheric forcing (high wind speeds) and strong oceanic forcing (significant sea surface temperature (SST) gradients). A simulated atmospheric cyclone evolves in a manner consistent with Eta reanalysis, and the simulated air-sea heat and momentum exchanges strongly affect the circulations in both the atmosphere and the ocean. For the simulated cyclone of 19-20 January 1998, maximum ocean-to-atmosphere heat fluxes first appear over the Gulf Stream in the South Atlantic Bight, and this results in rapid deepening of the cyclone off the Carolina coast. As the cyclone moves eastward, the heat flux maximum shifts into the region near Cape Hatteras and later northeast of Hatteras, where it enhances the wind locally. The oceanic response to the atmospheric forcing is closely related to the wind direction. Southerly and southwesterly winds tend to strengthen surface currents in the Gulf Stream, whereas northeasterly winds weaken the surface currents in the Gulf Stream and generate southwestward flows on the shelf. The oceanic feedback to the atmosphere moderates the cyclone strength. Compared with a simulation in which the oceanic model always passes the initial SST to the atmospheric model, the coupled simulation in which the oceanic model passes the evolving SST to the atmospheric model produces higher ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux near Gulf Stream meander troughs. This is due to wind-driven lateral shifts of the stream, which in turn enhance the local northeasterly winds. Away from the Gulf Stream the coupled simulation produces surface winds that are 5 similar to 10% weaker. Differences in the surface ocean currents between these two experiments are significant on the shelf and in the open ocean.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000180570400021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B3200%26rft.atitle%3DAir-sea%2Binteractions%2Bduring%2Bthe%2Bpassage%2Bof%2Ba%2Bwinter%2Bstorm%2Bover%2Bthe%2BGulf%2BStream%253A%2BA%2Bthree-dimensional%2Bcoupled%2Batmosphere-ocean%2Bmodel%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DYP%26rft.auinit%3DYP%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2001JC001161%26rft.eissn%3D2169-9291%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9275%26rft.issue%3DC11%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-OCEANS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-OCEANS%26rft.volume%3D107%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BYP%26rft.au%3DXue%252C%2BHJ%26rft.au%3DBane%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-OCEANS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

13,"Maheu, A",Nov 15 2014 ,River evaporation and corresponding heat fluxes in forested catchments,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"River water temperature is a very important variable in ecological studies, especially for the management of fisheries and aquatic resources. Temperature can impact on fish distribution, growth, mortality and community dynamics. River evaporation has been identified as an important heat loss and a key process in the thermal regime of rivers. However, its quantification remains a challenge, mainly because of the difficulty of making direct measurements. The objectives of this study were to characterize the evaporative heat flux at different scales (brook vs river) and to improve the estimation of the evaporative heat flux in a stream temperature model at the hourly timescale. Using a mass balance approach with floating minipans, we measured river evaporation at an hourly timescale in a medium-sized river (Little Southwest Miramichi) and a small brook (Catamaran Brook) in New Brunswick, Canada. With these direct measurements of evaporation, we developed mass transfer equations to estimate hourly evaporation rates from microclimate conditions measured 2m above the stream. During the summer 2012, river evaporation was more important for the medium-sized river with a mean daily evaporation rate of 3.0mmday(-1) in the Little Southwest Miramichi River compared with that of 1.0mmday(-1) in Catamaran Brook. Evaporation was the main heat loss mechanism in the two studied streams and was responsible for 42% of heat losses in the Little Southwest Miramichi River and 34% of heat losses in Catamaran Brook during the summer.

14,"Ding, YF",Mar 2017 ,Applications of Coupled Explicit-Implicit Solution of SWEs for Unsteady Flow in Yangtze River,WATER,"In engineering practice, the unsteady flows generated from the operation of hydropower station in the upstream region could significantly change the navigation system of waterways located in the middle-lower reaches of the river. In order to study the complex propagation, convergence and superposition characteristics of unsteady flows in a long channel with flow confluence, a numerical model based on the coupling of implicit and explicit solution algorithms of Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) has been applied to two large rivers in the reach of Yangtze River, China, which covers the distance from Yibin to Chongqing located upstream side of the Three Gorges Dam. The accuracy of numerical model has been validated by both the steady and unsteady flows using the prototype hydrological data. It is found that the unsteady flows show much more complex water level and discharge behaviors than the steady ones. The studied unsteady flows arising from the water regulation of two upstream hydropower stations could influence the region as far as Zhutuo hydrologic station, which is close to the city of Chongqing. Meanwhile, the computed stage-discharge rating curves at all observation stations demonstrate multi-value loop patterns because of the presence of additional water surface gradient.

16,"Liu, XW",Sep 2019 ,"Persistence and migration of tetracycline, sulfonamide, fluoroquinolone, and macrolide antibiotics in streams using a simulated hydrodynamic system",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"The potential persistence and migration of 14 antibiotics comprising sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and tetracyclines were conducted using a 50-d recirculating flume study supported by batch attenuation experiments with spiked concentrations. The study demonstrated that photodegradation was the dominant attenuation process for these antibiotics in the water environment. The half-lives of 2 -26 d were in order of sulfadiazine > sulfadimethoxine > sulfamerazine > sulfamethoxazole > sulfamethazine > sulfathiazole > ofloxacin > enrofloxacin > norfloxacin > ciprofloxacin > erythromycin > tetracycline > roxithromycin > oxytetracycline. These modest half-lives meant that the antibiotics were predicted to travel 30-400 km down a typical river before half the concentration would be lost. All antibiotics were detected on the surface sediment in the flume study. Under hyporheic exchange, some of them continually migrated into the deeper sediment and also the sediment pore water. All fluoroquinolones were detected in the sediments. The sulfonamides were detected in the pore water with relatively high concentrations and frequencies. Sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine and sulfathiazole in the upper layer pore water were found to be approaching equilibrium with the surface water. The high presence of sulfonamides in the pore water indicated that their high mobility and persistence potentially pose a risk to hyporheic zone. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

17,"Si, W",Apr 2019 ,A bivariable coupling model for river channel routing developed from the flow continuity equation and its application,WATER SA,"In this study, a bivariable coupling model for river channel routing is presented. The proposed model is developed from the Priessmann 4-point implicit differential scheme with a weight coefficient of river flow continuity equation. It is based on the transformation of two different expression forms of river channel storage equation. Furthermore, we consider the impact of lateral inflow along the study river channel from another perspective. In this paper we deduct lateral inflow from the lower section instead of adding lateral inflow to the upper section. In order to be representative of geographical range, river channel characteristics, flood magnitude, hydraulic characteristics and time, the proposed model is tested in 38 river channels of 6 river systems in China by using observed data during flood season. The rationality of model structure and the validity of model simulation are examined comprehensively. Comparison between the proposed model and Muskingum model shows that the proposed model can improve the simulation accuracy.

18,"Chu, Y",May 2019 ,Hydrologically connected and isolated floodplains in channelized streams: impacts on plant communities under a temperate monsoonal climate,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The aim of this study was to understand the changes of floodplain vegetation following the disruption of lateral connectivity from streams by levee construction under the temperate monsoonal conditions of South Korea. We compared the plant community structure and selected environmental variables in paired floodplains, one connected to the stream inside a levee and the other isolated by a levee. Cluster analysis of the vegetation identified ten plant communities and their associated indicator species. There were clear differences in communities between the connected floodplains and isolated floodplains. Pioneer and early-successional communities, which are resistant to flood disturbance, were found only in the connected floodplains. In contrast, diverse aquatic-macrophytic communities, adapted to long flood duration, and late-successional communities sensitive to flooding disturbance were found mainly in the isolated floodplains. -turnover was the main driver in species compositions in both types of floodplain. The isolated floodplains had a longer flood duration, and their soils had a finer texture, higher moisture content, and were more acidic compared tothe connected floodplains. Flood duration and topological elevation were identified as the most important environmental variables with respect to plant community composition. Our results suggest that reinstatement of lateral connectivity is necessary to restore the fluvial native vegetation in the isolated floodplains of a region with a monsoonal climate.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000463154600013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologically%2Bconnected%2Band%2Bisolated%2Bfloodplains%2Bin%2Bchannelized%2Bstreams%253A%2Bimpacts%2Bon%2Bplant%2Bcommunities%2Bunder%2Ba%2Btemperate%2Bmonsoonal%2Bclimate%26rft.aufirst%3DYunsoo%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DChu%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-019-3921-z%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D197%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D183-197%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D183%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D834%26rft.au%3DChu%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BSN%26rft.au%3DCho%252C%2BKH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Kuo, CW",Jan 1 2013 ,The influence of landscape configuration upon patterns of sediment storage in a highly connected river system,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Orthoimages are used to analyze the influence of valley width, channel slope, and the area of landslides that deliver sediment to valley floors upon the downstream pattern of sediment storage in the Liwu basin, eastern Taiwan. Confined valley settings dominate this steep, deeply dissected, uplifting mountainous basin. Although they occupy 82% of the whole channel network, sediment storage is limited in these reaches. Partly confined valley settings are restricted to relatively short reaches of two tributary systems. Over 95% of sediment storage in the Liwu River is found within the short alluvial section of laterally unconfined valley close to the river mouth. Lateral bars are the primary features associated with sediment storage in confined reaches (54% in total volume), while floodplains dominate the partly confined and laterally unconfined reaches (95% in total volume). Downstream patterns of sediment storage are controlled primarily by valley confinement (i.e., valley width) and landscape configuration. Channel slope and locations of contemporary landslides are not key determinants of sediment storage patterns. Sediment accumulation at confluence zones is not determined by the catchment area of tributaries or by landslide area; rather, it is determined by valley confinement of the trunk stream at the confluence and the associated downstream sequence of river types. Sediment conveyance is very effective within this highly connected river system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

20,"Phillips, CB",Dec 2019 ,"Fine-Particle Deposition, Retention, and Resuspension Within a Sand-Bedded Stream Are Determined by Streambed Morphodynamics",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Fine-particle dynamics occupy an integral role in nutrient, contaminant, and pathogen transport in rivers. Due to low settling velocities, fine particles are often treated as if they pass through the river without interacting significantly with bed sediments. However, fine particles are advected toward and into the bed by turbulence and hyporheic exchange, leading to deposition by filtration. Extensive remobilization of fine particles is commonly observed during high flow conditions, but these dynamics are not well understood. Here we analyze the remobilization of fine tracer particles within the context of sediment morphodynamics during an experimental flood. Field data collected within Clear Run, a sand-bedded stream, by Harvey et al. (2012, ) represent subsurface and water column time series of solute and fine particulate tracers. Overhead time lapse photography of the motion and growth of bed forms during the flood are used to extract and quantify morphodynamics, which we relate to the resuspension of fine particles by transforming bed form wavelength statistics into scour depth through a set of geometric relations derived from laboratory experiments. Particles deposited near the bed surface such that scour from larger bed forms remobilized the majority of particles within the streambed (>72%) accounting for the increase in resuspended fine particles during the flood. This analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of bed form dynamics and scour is necessary for understanding the remobilization of fine particles in Clear Run and that interpreting fine-particle dynamics during and beyond the event scale requires coupling with bed morphodynamics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000500911200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFine-Particle%2BDeposition%252C%2BRetention%252C%2Band%2BResuspension%2BWithin%2Ba%2BSand-Bedded%2BStream%2BAre%2BDetermined%2Bby%2BStreambed%2BMorphodynamics%26rft.aufirst%3DColin%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DCB%26rft.aulast%3DPhillips%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025272%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D10318%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D10303-10318%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D10303%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DPhillips%252C%2BCB%26rft.au%3DDallmann%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Macdonald, DM",Nov 2018 ,Water and nitrate exchange between a managed river and peri-urban floodplain aquifer: Quantification and management implications,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"The management of rivers for navigation, hydropower and flood risk reduction involves the installation of in-channel structures. These influence river levels and can affect groundwater flow within hydraulically-connected riparian floodplain aquifers. A comprehensively monitored, peri-urban, lowland river floodplain in the southern United Kingdom was used to explore these dependencies and to examine the implications for the flux exchange of water and nitrate between the river and the floodplain alluvial aquifer. The study demonstrated that rivers maintained at high levels by management structures, result in raised groundwater levels in the adjacent aquifer and complex groundwater flow patterns. Engineered river management structures were shown to promote flow from river to aquifer through the river bed but the majority of the associated nitrate was removed in the hyporheic zone. High-nitrate groundwater recharge to the alluvial aquifer also occurred through overbank flood flows. Across the floodplain, substantial denitrification occurred due to anaerobic conditions resulting from carbon-rich sediments and the shallow water table, the latter linked to the river management structures. An upper limit on the total annual mass of nitrate removed from river water entering the floodplain aquifer was estimated for the study site (2.9 x 10(4) kg), which was three orders of magnitude lower than the estimate of annual in-channel nitrate flux (1.8 x 10(7) kg). However, this capacity of lowland floodplains to reduce groundwater nitrate concentrations has local benefits, for example for private and public water supplies sourced from alluvial aquifers. The insights from the study also have relevance for those considering schemes that include the installation, removal or redesign of river management structures, as the resultant change in groundwater levels may have consequences for floodplain meadows and the nutrient status of the aquatic system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000446253500024,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWater%2Band%2Bnitrate%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Ba%2Bmanaged%2Briver%2Band%2Bperi-urban%2Bfloodplain%2Baquifer%253A%2BQuantification%2Band%2Bmanagement%2Bimplications%26rft.aufirst%3DDavid%2BMj%26rft.auinit%3DDM%26rft.aulast%3DMacdonald%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecoleng.2018.09.005%26rft.eissn%3D1872-6992%26rft.epage%3D237%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0925-8574%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D226-237%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D226%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D123%26rft.au%3DMacdonald%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DDixon%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DGooddy%252C%2BDC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Gonzalez-Pinzon, R",Sep 2014 ,Quantifying spatial differences in metabolism in headwater streams,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Stream functioning includes simultaneous interaction among solute transport, nutrient processing, and metabolism. Metabolism is measured with methods that have limited spatial representativeness and are highly uncertain. These problems restrict development of methods for up-scaling biological processes that mediate nutrient processing. We used the resazurin-resorufin (Raz-Rru) tracer system to estimate metabolism at different spatial scales (habitat, subreach, and reach) in 2 headwater streams of the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, USA), and present a mathematical framework for its application. We investigated the relationship between metabolism and hydrodynamics, i.e., geomorphic units (e.g., pool-riffle, pool-cascade), bed materials (i.e., alluvium vs bedrock channels), and type of transient storage (i.e., pure hyporheic exchange, pure surface transient storage, and a combination of both). The metabolic hotspots detected by the Raz-Rru system in both watersheds were related to hydrodynamic conditions known to increase biological processing. Higher respiration rate coefficients were found in subreaches with extensive hyporheic flow and flow through large woody-debris complexes, and higher reaeration rate coefficients were found in subreaches with intensive respiration activity and higher flow velocities. Because such hydrodynamic conditions and their effects on stream processing are difficult to quantify in headwater streams without the use of tracer techniques, the Raz-Rru system proved to be a good integrator of solute transport and stream metabolism processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000340580700011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bspatial%2Bdifferences%2Bin%2Bmetabolism%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DRicardo%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DGonzalez-Pinzon%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F677555%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D811%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D798-811%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D798%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D33%26rft.au%3DGonzalez-Pinzon%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DHaggerty%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DArgerich%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The results show that the water, ecology and economy subsystems changed slightly before 2007. After 2007, the economy developed rapidly, while the water and ecology increased for a short time and then decreased after 2013. The water-ecology-economy coupling coordination was on the verge of dysfunctional decline. Water and ecology were the main influencing factors on the coupling coordination. The coupling coordination showed a cross-county characteristic. Water and ecology in upstream counties had significant positive correlations with the coupling coordination in downstream counties. The economy subsystem in upstream counties, however, had significant negative correlations with water and ecology in downstream counties.

Rivers and watersheds support the livelihoods of surrounding communities. A healthy watershed can help alleviate floods and droughts, nourish forests, replenish groundwater, maintain fisheries, and provide for rich and diverse human life. However, the unreasonable development and use of rivers by human beings has strongly disrupted the natural health of rivers, and freshwater ecosystems are losing species and habitats rapidly. In 2012, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and the Yangtze River Basin Fisheries Resources Management Commission (YFC) came together to form an EcoPartnership to help preserve the natural fisheries of two great rivers in China and America, the Yangtze and the Mississippi.

27,"Ren, JH",Jul 2002 ,Effects of background water composition on stream-subsurface exchange of submicron colloids,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE,"While very fine sediments (colloids) are normally assumed to be readily transported downstream without deposition, recent evidence suggests that these particles will often deposit into streambeds due to a combination of physical and chemical mechanisms. This study investigates a regime of particle deposition where settling is unimportant and thus where particle deposition can only result from advective stream-subsurface exchange followed by deep-bed filtration. Laboratory flume experiments were conducted to examine the deposition of 0.45 mum diameter silica colloids into a silica sand bed. This system was selected for study because submicron sized colloids will not settle and silica colloid filtration by silica sand is generally quite low. Despite the lack of settling and the weak particle-particle interactions, the ongoing interfacial flux of colloids to the subsurface still produced significant filtration of silica colloids over the course of the experiments. Variation of the background ionic strength caused significant modification of filtration behavior and silica colloid deposition. In addition, cleaning the sand surface with mild acid and base washes reduced both filtration and net colloid exchange. These experimental results are interpreted in terms of a fundamentally based physicochemical model which predicts net particle deposition based on stream and subsurface hydrodynamic conditions and subsurface filtration. These results show that both particle surface chemical conditions and background water chemistry play a critical role in controlling the net transport and deposition of fine sediments. It is important to recognize the effects of physicochemical processes both when designing laboratory experiments and when analyzing environmental particle transport.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000176346100008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bbackground%2Bwater%2Bcomposition%2Bon%2Bstream-subsurface%2Bexchange%2Bof%2Bsubmicron%2Bcolloids%26rft.aufirst%3DJH%26rft.auinit%3DJH%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9372%25282002%2529128%253A7%2528624%2529%26rft.epage%3D634%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9372%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BENGINEERING-ASCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D624-634%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D624%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BENG-ASCE%26rft.volume%3D128%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+ENGINEERING-ASCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
28,"Abdelaziz, AH",May 2015 ,Learning Dynamic Stream Weights For Coupled-HMM-Based Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING,"With the increasing use of multimedia data in communication technologies, the idea of employing visual information in automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently gathered momentum. In conjunction with the acoustical information, the visual data enhances the recognition performance and improves the robustness of ASR systems in noisy and reverberant environments. In audio-visual systems, dynamic weighting of audio and video streams according to their instantaneous confidence is essential for reliably and systematically achieving high performance. In this paper, we present a complete framework that allows blind estimation of dynamic stream weights for audio-visual speech recognition based on coupled hidden Markov models (CHMMs). As a stream weight estimator, we consider using multilayer perceptrons and logistic functions to map multidimensional reliability measure features to audiovisual stream weights. Training the parameters of the stream weight estimator requires numerous input-output tuples of reliability measure features and their corresponding stream weights. We estimate these stream weights based on oracle knowledge using an expectation maximization algorithm. We define 31-dimensional feature vectors that combine model-based and signal-based reliability measures as inputs to the stream weight estimator. During decoding, the trained stream weight estimator is used to blindly estimate stream weights. The entire framework is evaluated using the Grid audio-visual corpus and compared to state-of-the-art stream weight estimation strategies. The proposed framework significantly enhances the performance of the audio-visual ASR system in all examined test conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000352281500005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLearning%2BDynamic%2BStream%2BWeights%2BFor%2BCoupled-HMM-Based%2BAudio-Visual%2BSpeech%2BRecognition%26rft.aufirst%3DAhmed%2BHussen%26rft.auinit%3DAH%26rft.aulast%3DAbdelaziz%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTASLP.2015.2409785%26rft.eissn%3D2329-9304%26rft.epage%3D876%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2329-9290%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE-ACM%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BAUDIO%2BSPEECH%2BAND%2BLANGUAGE%2BPROCESSING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D863-876%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D863%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE-ACM%2BT%2BAUDIO%2BSPE%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DAbdelaziz%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DZeiler%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DKolossa%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=IEEE-ACM+TRANSACTIONS+ON+AUDIO+SPEECH+AND+LANGUAGE+PROCESSING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
29,"Boxall, GD",May 2008 ,Landscape topography and the distribution of Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi) in a high desert stream,ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,"Lahontan cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi, are currently limited in their distribution to a patchwork of small isolated populations, the result of habitat degradation and natural variation in landscape and in-stream conditions. The objectives of this study were to determine if landscape topography influences trout distribution, and if water temperatures control this response. The work was carried out in a sub-basin of the Quinn River system, McDermitt Creek, which drains the sagebrush desert of southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada. Head-water tributaries of this creek consist of alternating canyon-confined and valley bounded reaches. Trout within these systems are challenged by low discharge and high temperatures during the summer, and anchor ice during the winter. Contiguous whole stream surveys were used to look at trout distribution during the summer of 2003 and spring and fall of 2004. Our results suggested that topography can affect trout distribution. Trout numbers were highest in areas with greater numbers of nick-points (the transition zones between less confined and more confined valley segments) and greater valley confinement. Additionally, in the downstream portion of our headwater reaches, more trout were found in nickpoints than expected based on the availability of this habitat type. Our data suggest that hyporheic inputs may be high in such areas, thus providing trout with shelter from warm water in the summer, anchor ice in the winter, and shallow stream depths during all seasons. Spatial occurrence of these areas of refugia can be taken into consideration when planning land use activities and restoration efforts. Further research is required to confirm that topography can affect the distribution of Lahontan cutthroat trout in other systems, and to better understand the mechanisms behind these patterns.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000256025500010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLandscape%2Btopography%2Band%2Bthe%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2BLahontan%2Bcutthroat%2Btrout%2B%2528Oncorhynchus%2Bclarki%2Bhenshawi%2529%2Bin%2Ba%2Bhigh%2Bdesert%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DGeorge%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DGD%26rft.aulast%3DBoxall%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10641-007-9254-1%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5133%26rft.epage%3D84%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0378-1909%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BBIOLOGY%2BOF%2BFISHES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D71-84%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D71%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BBIOL%2BFISH%26rft.volume%3D82%26rft.au%3DBoxall%252C%2BGD%26rft.au%3DGiannico%252C%2BGR%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BHW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+BIOLOGY+OF+FISHES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
30,"Timoner, X",Aug 2012 ,"Functional responses of stream biofilms to flow cessation, desiccation and rewetting",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Mediterranean climate regions are characterised by long summer droughts that usually involve flow intermittency in low- to mid-order streams. Flow intermittency implies flow cessation, drying and subsequent rewetting of the streambed, and affects both autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. The balance between these processes, as well as the balance in the use of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) may change because of the ongoing increase in stream flow intermittency caused by global change in many regions. It is therefore crucial to understand better the consequences of this phenomenon. 2. Our two initial hypotheses were (i) that flow intermittency would impact more on autotrophic than on heterotrophic processes in stream biofilms owing to the higher water dependence of autotrophs, as well as differences in the water storage capacity of the stream biofilm compartments where autotrophic and heterotrophic processes mainly occur (surface cobbles versus hyporheic sediments) and (ii) that the C-N-P use by biofilms would change during the dry period (terrestrial phase) owing to the extreme water stress conditions. These hypotheses were tested by analysing the functional response of the main stream biofilms (epilithic, epipsammic and hyporheic) during flow cessation, desiccation and rewetting in a Mediterranean forested stream. The autotrophic response was characterised through changes in the photon yield, whereas the heterotrophic response was characterised by changes in the extracellular enzyme activities. 3. Streambed desiccation had clear effects on the functioning of stream biofilms. Autotrophic biomass decreased by 80% with streambed desiccation, but recovered rapidly after flow resumption. Heterotrophs were more resistant to water stress, especially in the epipsammic and hyporheic biofilms where bacterial cell density decreased only by 20%. 4. Extracellular enzyme activities remained relatively high, and the balance in the C-N-P use by biofilms changed during the dry period. The C and P breakdown capacities were maintained during dry conditions, especially in the epipsammic and hyporheic biofilms, but the degradation of N compounds sharply decreased. Elemental molar ratios (C:N and C:P) of the different biofilms also changed with streambed desiccation. C:P ratios increased from 80 to 300, while the C:N ratios increased from 10 to 16. 5. Given the contrasting responses of autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in the different biofilms, our results suggest that the current increase in flow intermittency extent is likely to increase the relative importance of heterotrophic processes in stream ecosystems, as well as the relative contribution of the hyporheic biofilm to C-N-P use. Our results further suggest that the longer streams remain dry, the more the biofilm stoichiometry will change.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000306139300004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFunctional%2Bresponses%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bbiofilms%2Bto%2Bflow%2Bcessation%252C%2Bdesiccation%2Band%2Brewetting%26rft.aufirst%3DXisca%26rft.auinit%3DX%26rft.aulast%3DTimoner%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2012.02818.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1578%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1565-1578%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1565%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DTimoner%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DAcuna%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DSabater%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
31,"Dallmann, J",Dec 16 2021 ,Bedform segregation and locking increase storage of natural and synthetic particles in rivers,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Here the authors show that hyporheic flow, bed morphology, and bed stability are intimately related, and that this relationship is expressed as distinct locked and segregated states of bedform dynamics, which carries implications for river system behavior in general and the storage of carbon, nutrients, and contaminants in particular.While the ecological significance of hyporheic exchange and fine particle transport in rivers is well established, these processes are generally considered irrelevant to riverbed morphodynamics. We show that coupling between hyporheic exchange, suspended sediment deposition, and sand bedform motion strongly modulates morphodynamics and sorts bed sediments. Hyporheic exchange focuses fine-particle deposition within and below mobile bedforms, which suppresses bed mobility. However, deposited fines are also remobilized by bedform motion, providing a mechanism for segregating coarse and fine particles in the bed. Surprisingly, two distinct end states emerge from the competing interplay of bed stabilization and remobilization: a locked state in which fine particle deposition completely stabilizes the bed, and a dynamic equilibrium in which frequent remobilization sorts the bed and restores mobility. These findings demonstrate the significance of hyporheic exchange to riverbed morphodynamics and clarify how dynamic interactions between coarse and fine particles produce sedimentary patterns commonly found in rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000731101200024,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B7315%26rft.atitle%3DBedform%2Bsegregation%2Band%2Blocking%2Bincrease%2Bstorage%2Bof%2Bnatural%2Band%2Bsynthetic%2Bparticles%2Bin%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DDallmann%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41467-021-27554-4%26rft.eissn%3D2041-1723%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURE%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BCOMMUN%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DDallmann%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DPhillips%252C%2BCB%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=NATURE+COMMUNICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
32,"Whorley, SB",2016 ,Connecting algal taxonomic information to essential fatty acid content in agricultural streams,PHYCOLOGIA,"Benthic algae comprise a diversity of taxonomic lineages and produce important biochemical compounds required by higher trophic levels. Chief among these compounds are essential fatty acids (EFAs) that aquatic consumers require for their metabolic and reproductive processes. However, habitat changes from anthropogenic activities, namely, agriculture, can affect not only which species of algae may be present but also the quantity and quality of EFAs they produce. This study aims to evaluate how benthic algal taxonomic composition and EFA concentrations vary in streams affected by agriculture and remediation through stream-associated best management practices (BMPs). The study was undertaken in the Upper Delaware River watershed in New York state, in which BMPs have been installed over multiple years (-BMP age). Some results indicate that BMPs were able to reduce effects of agriculture. Changes in benthic algal assemblages, the proportions of algal taxonomic groups, and in specific taxonomic members were not significant. The proportion of diatoms in assemblages decreased with increasing agricultural effects (F = 6.313, P = 0.001). Conversely, the proportion of chlorophytes increased in agriculturally affected streams (F = 9.336, P < 0.001). Changes in taxonomic composition were associated with changes in various EFA compound concentrations. Agricultural streams had higher concentrations of total EFAs along with more chlorophytes (r = -0.268, P = 0.010) and fewer diatoms (r = 0.270, P = 0.009) than did reference or minimally affected streams. Particularly, agricultural streams had greater concentrations of key EFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. However, there were no differences among assemblage's nutritional quality (Sigma omega(3)/Sigma omega(6)). The data presented here suggest that analyzing shifts in algal taxonomic groups in conjunction with measurements of fatty acids in broad EFA groups may provide more information when characterizing algal assemblages than examination of algal taxa or analysis of EFA compounds alone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000390261700004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConnecting%2Balgal%2Btaxonomic%2Binformation%2Bto%2Bessential%2Bfatty%2Bacid%2Bcontent%2Bin%2Bagricultural%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DSarah%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DWhorley%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2216%252F15-123.1%26rft.eissn%3D2330-2968%26rft.epage%3D542%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0031-8884%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DPHYCOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D531-542%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D531%26rft.stitle%3DPHYCOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DWhorley%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DWehr%252C%2BJD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=PHYCOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
33,"Cao, ZX",Mar 2002 ,Coupled and decoupled numerical modeling of flow and morphological evolution in alluvial rivers,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Existing numerical river models are mostly built upon asynchronous solution of simplified governing equations. The strong coupling between water flow, sediment transport, and morphological evolution is thus ignored to a certain extent. An earlier study led to the development of a fully coupled model and identified the impacts of simplifications in the water-sediment mixture and global bed material continuity equations as well as of the asynchronous solution procedure for aggradation processes. This paper presents the results of an extended study along this line, highlighting the impacts on both aggradation and degradation processes. Simplifications in the continuity equations for the water-sediment mixture and bed material are found to have negligible effects on degradation. This is, however, in contrast to aggradation processes, in which the errors purely due to simplified continuity equations can be significant transiently. The asynchronous solution procedure is found to entail appreciable inaccuracy for both aggradation and degradation processes. Further, the asynchronous solution procedure can render the physical problem mathematically ill posed by invoking an extra upstream boundary condition in the supercritical flow regime. Finally, the impacts of simplified continuity equations and an asynchronous solution procedure are shown to be comparable with those of largely tuned friction factors, indicating their significance in calibrating numerical river models. It is concluded that the coupled system of complete governing equations needs to be synchronously solved for refined modeling of alluvial rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000174046300008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Band%2Bdecoupled%2Bnumerical%2Bmodeling%2Bof%2Bflow%2Band%2Bmorphological%2Bevolution%2Bin%2Balluvial%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DZX%26rft.auinit%3DZX%26rft.aulast%3DCao%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9429%25282002%2529128%253A3%2528306%2529%26rft.epage%3D321%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9429%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BENGINEERING-ASCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D306-321%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D306%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BENG-ASCE%26rft.volume%3D128%26rft.au%3DCao%252C%2BZX%26rft.au%3DDay%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DEgashira%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+ENGINEERING-ASCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
34,"Koruk, K",May 30 2020 ,A multi-technique approach to determine temporal and spatial variability of groundwater-stream water exchange,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Characterizing the spatio-temporal distribution of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) exchange fluxes is of paramount importance in understanding catchment behavior. A wide range of field-based techniques are available for such characterization. The objective of this study is to quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of the exchange fluxes along the cakit stream (Nigde, Turkey) through coupling a set of geophysical techniques and in-stream measurements in a hierarchical manner. First, geological and water quality information were combined at the catchment scale to determine key areas for reach-scale focus. Second, electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys were conducted along the reach to pinpoint potential groundwater upwelling locations. EMI anomalies guided our focus to a 665 m-long reach of the stream. Along this selected reach, a fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) system was utilized to investigate streambed temperature profiles at fine spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, vertical hydraulic gradients and exchange fluxes were investigated using nested piezometers and vertical temperature profiles, respectively, at two potential upwelling locations and a potential downwelling location identified by previous surveys. The results of the study reveal heterogeneity of vertical water-flow components with seasonal variability. The EMI survey was successful in identifying a localized groundwater upwelling location. FO-DTS measurements revealed a warm temperature anomaly during cold air temperature and low streamflow conditions at the same upwelling site. Our point-based methods, namely vertical temperature profiles and vertical hydraulic gradient estimates, however, did not always provide consistent results with each other and with EMI and FO-DTS measurements. This study, therefore, highlights the opportunities and challenges in incorporating multi-scale observations in a hierarchical manner in characterization of the GW-SW exchange processes that are known to be highly heterogeneous in time and space. Overall, a combination of different methods helps to overcome the limitations of each single method and increases confidence in the obtained results.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000523296200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmulti-technique%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Bdetermine%2Btemporal%2Band%2Bspatial%2Bvariability%2Bof%2Bgroundwater-stream%2Bwater%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DKasimcan%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DKoruk%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13754%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D2627%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2612-2627%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2612%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DKoruk%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DYilmaz%252C%2BKK%26rft.au%3DBinley%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
35,"Xian, Y",May 2017 ,Impact of lateral flow on the transition from connected to disconnected stream-aquifer systems,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Understanding the mechanisms by which stream water infiltrates through streambeds to recharge groundwater systems is essential to sustainable management of scarce water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. An inverted water table (IWT) can develop under a stream in response to the desaturation between the stream and underlying aquifer as the system changes from a connected to disconnected status. However, previous studies have suggested that the IWT can only occur at the bottom of a low permeability streambed in which only the vertical flow between the stream and groundwater during disconnection was assumed. In the present study, numerical simulations revealed that the lateral flow induced by capillarity or heterogeneity also plays an essential role on interactions between streams and aquifers. Three pathways were identified for the transition from connection to disconnection in homogenous systems; notably, the lowest point of an IWT can develop not only at the bottom of the streambed but also within the streambed or the aquifer in response to the initial desaturation at, above, or below the interface between the streambed and aquifer (IBSA), respectively. A sensitivity analysis indicated that in wide streams, the lowest point of an IWT only occurs at the bottom of the streambed; however, for a stream half width of 1 m above a 6 m thick sandy loam streambed, the lowest point occurs in the streambed as stream depth is less than 0.5 m. This critical stream depth increases with streambed thickness and decreases with stream width. Thus, in narrow streams the lowest point can also develop in a thick streambed under a shallow stream. In narrow streams, the lowest point also forms in the aquifer if the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed to that of the aquifer is greater than the ratio of the streambed thickness to the sum of the stream depth and the streambed thickness; correspondingly, the streambed is thin but relatively permeable and the stream is deep. Furthermore, in heterogeneous streambed systems, two or three pathways can simultaneously occur and various parts of the IWT occur at distinct positions relative to the IBSA. This challenges the commonly held assumption that streambed under a disconnected stream is always fully saturated, and limits the methods which introduce a negative or atmospheric pressure value at the IBSA to calculate seepage rate or assess stream-aquifer connectivity.

36,"Wagner, K",Oct 2014 ,Functional and Structural Responses of Hyporheic Biofilms to Varying Sources of Dissolved Organic Matter,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Headwater streams are tightly connected with the terrestrial milieu from which they receive deliveries of organic matter, often through the hyporheic zone, the transition between groundwater and streamwater. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial sources (that is, allochthonous) enters the hyporheic zone, where it may mix with DOM from in situ production (that is, autochthonous) and where most of the microbial activity takes place. Allochthonous DOM is typically considered resistant to microbial metabolism compared to autochthonous DOM. The composition and functioning of microbial biofilm communities in the hyporheic zone may therefore be controlled by the relative availability of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM, which can have implications for organic matter processing in stream ecosystems. Experimenting with hyporheic biofilms exposed to model allochthonous and autochthonous DOM and using 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA (targeting the ""active"" community composition) and of the 16S rRNA gene (targeting the ""bulk"" community composition), we found that allochthonous DOM may drive shifts in community composition whereas autochthonous DOM seems to affect community composition only transiently. Our results suggest that priority effects based on resource-driven stochasticity shape the community composition in the hyporheic zone. Furthermore, measurements of extracellular enzymatic activities suggest that the additions of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM had no clear effect on the function of the hyporheic biofilms, indicative of functional redundancy. Our findings unravel possible microbial mechanisms that underlie the buffering capacity of the hyporheic zone and that may confer stability to stream ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000341887100014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFunctional%2Band%2BStructural%2BResponses%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BBiofilms%2Bto%2BVarying%2BSources%2Bof%2BDissolved%2BOrganic%2BMatter%26rft.aufirst%3DKaroline%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DWagner%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1128%252FAEM.01128-14%26rft.eissn%3D1098-5336%26rft.epage%3D6012%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0099-2240%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BAND%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BMICROBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6004-6012%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6004%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BENVIRON%2BMICROB%26rft.volume%3D80%26rft.au%3DWagner%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DBengtsson%252C%2BMM%26rft.au%3DBattin%252C%2BTJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+AND+ENVIRONMENTAL+MICROBIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
37,"Mary, N",Jan 2000 ,First survey of interstitial fauna in New Caledonian rivers: influence of geological and geomorphological characteristics,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Despite zoogeographical implications and geological anomalies, the interstitial fauna of New Caledonian rivers remains unstudied. During this first survey, 15 different sized rivers varying in sediment grain size and geological substratum were sampled for both benthic (Surber sampler) and interstitial (Karaman-Chappuis pits) invertebrates during summer 1998-99. A total of 34 taxa was collected during the study, of which 22 were present in the sediment interstices. Interstitial assemblages were dominated by the Oligochaeta (present in 80% of the samples), the Chironomidae (in 73%), the Ceratopogonidae (in 73%), the Coleoptera Berosini (in 47%), the Turbellaria (in 47%), the OstracodaVestalenula sp. (in 40%) and the Copepoda Cyclopoida (in 40%). New amphipods close to Bogidiellidae were found in two stations. Some organisms, frequent and abundant in the benthic layer, were rare or absent in the sediment interstices (e.g. Decapoda Atyidae, Ephemeroptera Leptophlebiidae, Trichoptera Hydropsychidae and Leptoceridae, Diptera Simulidae). River size and distance between the station and the ocean were unassociated with abundance, taxonomic richness or composition of interstitial assemblages. In contrast, both abundance and taxonomic richness were significantly lower when sediment grain size decreased (probably because of low exchange with surface assemblages) and when the percentage of peridotitic substratum in the catchment increased (probably because of its high nickel and chromium contents). These preliminary results suggest that interstitial fauna can be used for ecological survey and river management even in tropical regions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000085998100017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFirst%2Bsurvey%2Bof%2Binterstitial%2Bfauna%2Bin%2BNew%2BCaledonian%2Brivers%253A%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bgeological%2Band%2Bgeomorphological%2Bcharacteristics%26rft.aufirst%3DN%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DMary%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1003938629671%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D208%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D199-208%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D199%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D418%26rft.au%3DMary%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

To examine the relationship between sediment texture, biogeochemistry, and biological activity in the Columbia River HZ, the grain size distributions for sediment samples were characterized to define geological facies, and the relationships among physical properties of the facies, physicochemical attributes of the local environment, and the structure and activity of associated microbial communities were examined. Mud and sand content and the presence of microbial heterotrophic and nitrifying communities partially explained the variability in many biogeochemical attributes such as C:N ratio and % TOC. Microbial community analysis revealed a high relative abundance of putative ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospirae. Network analysis showed negative relationships between sets of co-varying organisms and sand and mud contents, and positive relationships with total organic carbon. Our results indicate grain size distribution is a good predictor of biogeochemical properties, and that subsets of the overall microbial community respond to different sediment texture. Relationships between facies and hydrobiogeochemical properties enable facies-based conditional simulation/mapping of these properties to inform multiscale modeling of hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000411185100059,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B12006%26rft.atitle%3DGeochemical%2Band%2BMicrobial%2BCommunity%2BAttributes%2Bin%2BRelation%2Bto%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BGeological%2BFacies%26rft.aufirst%3DZ.%26rft.auinit%3DZ%26rft.aulast%3DHou%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41598-017-12275-w%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2045-2322%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENTIFIC%2BREPORTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BREP-UK%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DHou%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DNelson%252C%2BWC%26rft.au%3DZachara%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=SCIENTIFIC+REPORTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
39,"Mathers, KL",Oct 2021 ,Artificial flood reduces fine sediment clogging enhancing hyporheic zone physicochemistry and accessibility for macroinvertebrates,,"River regulation globally has reduced the riverine connectivity (longitudinal, lateral and vertically) with significant consequences for their abiotic and biotic components. To restore the ecological integrity of regulated rivers, artificial floods are increasingly being employed in large-scale flow restoration efforts. Despite considerable recognition regarding the ecological and geomorphological effects of artificial floods on benthic habitats, understanding the implications for the hyporheic zone is essentially absent. This void in our management knowledge base is considerable given that one of the most widely associated consequences of flow regulation is excessive deposition of fine sediment (sedimentation; particles <2 mm) that often disconnects the hyporheic zone from surface waters. In this study, we examined the effects of an artificial flood on the hyporheic zone of the River Spol in Switzerland. Fine sediment content of shallow benthic substrates (ca. 10 cm) was significantly reduced following the flood. The flushing of fine sediment was also apparent in hyporheic substrates (depths of 0.25 and 0.50 m), resulting in a reconnection of previously clogged interstitial pathways. The opening of interstitial pore space enhanced physicochemical conditions in the hyporheic zone, such as improved dissolved oxygen concentrations, and supported greater taxa richness. Alterations in the composition of shallower hyporheic assemblages (0.25 m) were evident following the flood. These results indicated that benthic pore space became more connected to surface waters following the flood, thereby enhancing accessibility for interstitial organisms. Our results suggest that artificial floods can be an effective management tool to restore spatial heterogeneity in sediment composition and pore space and improve vertical connectivity for macroinvertebrates. We anticipate that artificial floods would be required on a regular basis given the re-accumulation of fine sediment 10 months later in our study system.

We present a lumped parameter model that can be used to quantify the mass loss for nitrate in the HZ operating at the scale of river reaches to the entire catchments. The model is based on using exposure times (ET) to account for the effective timescales of reactive transport in the HZ. Reach scale ET distributions are derived by removing the portion of hyporheic residence times (RT) associated with flow through the oxic zone. The model was used to quantify nitrate removal for two scenarios: (1) a 100 m generic river reach and (2) a small agricultural catchment in Brittany (France). For the field site, hyporheic RT were derived from measured in-stream 222Rn activities and mass balance modeling. Simulations were carried out using different types of RT distributions (exponential, power law, and gamma-type) for which ET were derived. Mass loss of nitrate in the HZ for the field site ranged from 0 to 0.45 kg day-1 depending on the RT distribution and the availability of oxygen in the streambed sediments. Simulations with power law ET distribution models only show very little removal of nitrate due to the heavy weighting toward shorter flow paths that are confined to the oxic sediments. Based on the simulation results, we suggest that using ET will likely lead to more realistic estimates for nutrient removal in river and stream networks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000543939800079,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuantification%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BNitrate%2BRemoval%2Bat%2Bthe%2BReach%2BScale%253A%2BExposure%2BTimes%2BVersus%2BResidence%2BTimes%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFrei%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025540%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D9825%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D9808-9825%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D9808%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DFrei%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DDurejka%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DGilfedder%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Xiong, ML",Apr 2021 ,A New Approach to Three-Dimensional Flow in a Pumped Confined Aquifer Connected to a Shallow Stream: Near-Stream and Far-From-Stream Groundwater Extractions,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Existing analytical models, which have assumed a fully penetrating stream (FPS), give significant error in predicting stream depletion/filtration rate (SDR) for the typical case of a partially penetrating stream. In addition, existing source terms, embedded in flow equations for stream treatment, neglect the effect of small-scale streambed storage. This study develops two new models for describing three-dimensional (3D) flow in a pumped confined aquifer connected to a stream with shallow penetration. One model treats a finite-width stream as a modified source term reflecting the streambed storage effect for the case of near-stream groundwater extraction. The finite element solution of the model is built. The other model considers a rectilinear stream as a source term neglecting the streambed storage effect for the case of far-from-stream groundwater extraction. The semi-analytical solution of the model is derived by the Laplace transform and Fourier transform. The time-domain approximate solution for SDR is also derived. Results suggest the modified source term serves as a convenient and efficient alternative to existing stream treatments in incorporating the streambed storage effect and achieving both accurate solution prediction and coarse aquifer discretization. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates the response of SDR more sensitive to the change in vertical aquifer hydraulic conductivity than that in horizontal one due to shallow penetration of stream. A shallow stream can be regarded as a FPS in predicting SDR under three quantitative conditions. As concluded, this study provides hydrologists with a better understanding of SDR behavior subject to 3D flow in typical stream-aquifer system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000644063800037,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028780%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BNew%2BApproach%2Bto%2BThree-Dimensional%2BFlow%2Bin%2Ba%2BPumped%2BConfined%2BAquifer%2BConnected%2Bto%2Ba%2BShallow%2BStream%253A%2BNear-Stream%2Band%2BFar-From-Stream%2BGroundwater%2BExtractions%26rft.aufirst%3DManling%26rft.auinit%3DML%26rft.aulast%3DXiong%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028780%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DXiong%252C%2BML%26rft.au%3DTong%252C%2BCC%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BCS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Herzog, SP",Sep 18 2018 ,Performance of Engineered Streambeds for Inducing Hyporheic Transient Storage and Attenuation of Resazurin,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Several U.S. programs provide financial incentives for stream restoration to improve degraded water quality. These efforts prioritize hyporheic zone (HZ) restoration to enhance contaminant attenuation, but no stream restoration or stormwater best management practice (BMP) explicitly tailors hyporheic residence times to target specific contaminants of concern. Here we present the first physical demonstration of a new BMP called Biohydrochemical Enhancements for Streamwater Treatment (BEST). BEST are subsurface modules that use hydraulic conductivity modifications to drive hyporheic exchange and control residence times, combined with reactive geomedia to increase HZ reaction rates. Experiments were conducted in 15-m long outdoor flumes: one all-sand control, the other with BEST modules. Sodium chloride (conservative tracer) and resazurin (surrogate for a reactive pollutant) injections were conducted, with observations analyzed by stream transient storage models. Results demonstrated that BEST increased the effective HZ size and resazurin transformation both by similar to 50% compared to the control. Numerical simulations of extended reach lengths showed that BEST could achieve 1-log removal of resazurin in 111 m, versus 172 m in the control, and 414 m and 683 m in two numerically simulated urban streams. These results emphasize the potential of BEST as a novel HZ BMP to improve streamwater quality.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000445441000044,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPerformance%2Bof%2BEngineered%2BStreambeds%2Bfor%2BInducing%2BHyporheic%2BTransient%2BStorage%2Band%2BAttenuation%2Bof%2BResazurin%26rft.aufirst%3DSkuyler%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DSP%26rft.aulast%3DHerzog%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.est.8b01145%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D10636%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D18%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D10627-10636%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D10627%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DHerzog%252C%2BSP%26rft.au%3DHiggins%252C%2BCP%26rft.au%3DMcCray%252C%2BJE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Zheng, Z",Jan 2014 ,A deterministic and Monte Carlo coupling method for PWR cavity radiation streaming calculation,ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY,"PWR cavity radiation streaming calculation is important for the evaluation of the radioactive dose rate in structural materials. Discrete Ordinates (S-N) method has been widely used to solve shielding problems, but it is difficult to apply to a complex geometry. Monte Carlo (MC) method can treat the geometry exactly but requires very long computing time to obtain acceptable statistic deviations. Thus, an S-N-MC coupling method is adopted in order to combine the advantages of both S-N method and MC method in PWR cavity radiation streaming calculations. To develop this coupling method, two surface source models, the combined surface source model (CSSM) and the single surface source model (SSSM), are proposed and analyzed. From the numerical results two conclusions can be drawn. (1) The S-N-MC coupling method offers a speedup factor of 2-20 compared with the MC method to obtain the same statistic deviations. (2) In the S-N-MC coupling method, the CSSM is more efficient than the SSSM in reducing statistic deviations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

44,"Vander Vorste, R",Jan 2017 ,Gammarus pulex (Crustacea: Amphipoda) avoids increasing water temperature and intraspecific competition through vertical migration into the hyporheic zone: a mesocosm experiment,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"The saturated interstices below and adjacent to the riverbed (i.e., the hyporheic zone) can be a refuge for biota during low flows, flow cessation and river drying. Prior to complete drying, organisms are constrained by abiotic and biotic factors (e.g., water temperature, competition) and may respond through vertical migration into the hyporheic zone. However, it remains unclear when temperature and competition become harsh enough to trigger migration. Furthermore, potential consequences of using the hyporheic zone, which is often food-limited, on the survival, effects on ecosystem function and physiology of organisms are unknown. We tested the hypotheses that (1) Gammarus pulex, a widespread detritivore, migrates into the hyporheic zone to avoid increasing surface water temperature and intraspecific competition and (2) that these factors would reduce their survival, leaf mass consumption and energy stores. Using 36 mesocosms, three temperature (15, 20, 25 A degrees C) and species density levels (low, medium, high) were manipulated in a factorial design over 15 days. Increasing temperature to 25 A degrees C and a threefold increase in density both caused G. pulex to vertically migrate, and the interaction of these factors was additive, rather than antagonistic or synergistic. Importantly, survival, leaf consumption and glycogen content were reduced in high temperature and density treatments, suggesting tradeoffs between tolerating harsh surface conditions and limitations of inhabiting the hyporheic zone. Identifying that the hyporheic zone is used by G. pulex to avoid high water temperature and intraspecific competition is a key finding considering the global-scale increases in temperature and flow intermittence.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394107900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGammarus%2Bpulex%2B%2528Crustacea%253A%2BAmphipoda%2529%2Bavoids%2Bincreasing%2Bwater%2Btemperature%2Band%2Bintraspecific%2Bcompetition%2Bthrough%2Bvertical%2Bmigration%2Binto%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2Ba%2Bmesocosm%2Bexperiment%26rft.aufirst%3DR.%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DVander%2BVorste%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-016-0478-z%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D55%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D45-55%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D45%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D79%26rft.au%3DVander%2BVorste%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DMermillod-Blondin%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
45,"Wallace, CD",May 28 2020 ,Nitrate Removal Within Heterogeneous Riparian Aquifers Under Tidal Influence,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Tides in coastal rivers drive river-groundwater (hyporheic) exchange and provide opportunities for nitrate removal that may improve coastal water quality. Silt and sand layers in coastal floodplain sediments can alter the flow and transformation of nitrate. Our goal was to understand how sediment heterogeneity influences nitrogen dynamics near tidal rivers. Numerical simulations show that oxic, variably saturated sand layers and anoxic, organic-rich silt layers are sites of nitrification and denitrification, respectively. The exchange of river water and nitrate through heterogeneous sediments increases with sand fraction, as sand lenses become longer and more connected. The amount of nitrate removed from river water also increases but represents a smaller portion of total nitrate exchange through the hyporheic zone, causing removal efficiency to decline. Our results suggest that accurate characterization of aquifer heterogeneity leads to an improved understanding of sites of nutrient transformation within floodplain sediments.Plain Language Summary Excess nitrate can degrade coastal water quality, but microbial reactions reduce its concentration within the bed and banks of tidal rivers, where surface water and groundwater mix. Spatial arrangements of different sediments (sand and mud) affect the mixing of river water and groundwater and thus affect nitrate removal. Here, we use computer models to simulate nitrate transformation along a tidal river with different amounts of coarse and fine sediments. Coarse sediments promote groundwater flow and nitrate production, while fine sediments promote nitrate removal. The amount of nitrate removed from river water is greater in aquifers with coarser sediments, but the removal efficiency decreases. Removal also varies with the spatial distribution of sand and mud in sediments but to a lesser degree. Computer models of nitrate transport should consider the distribution of different sediment types.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000560371700036,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019GL085699%26rft.atitle%3DNitrate%2BRemoval%2BWithin%2BHeterogeneous%2BRiparian%2BAquifers%2BUnder%2BTidal%2BInfluence%26rft.aufirst%3DCorey%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DCD%26rft.aulast%3DWallace%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019GL085699%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DWallace%252C%2BCD%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DBarnes%252C%2BRT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

These exchange flows are robustly influenced by some mechanisms such as permeability, lithological nature of the soil, landscape, in addition to the difference between the hydrometric height of the river and the piezometric level of groundwater. The study area of Bou Ahmed plain is vulnerable to intensive pumping mainly in the coastal fringe. The increase in water demand, due to demographic development, is accompanied by pressure on groundwater abstraction which causes significant drops of the groundwater level. The main objectives of this study are to develop Geographic Information System database and mathematical models to analyze spatial and temporal hydrogeological characteristics and hydrodynamic functioning of groundwater flow of the Bou Ahmed aquifer. The present work exhibits the characteristics of the river-groundwater exchanges in an alluvial plain. Therefore, we quantified the flows exchanged between a river and its groundwater using GIS tools along with measurements of parameters obtained by the differential gauging, which was carried out in the field, and hydrogeological boreholes data. These quantified flows, moreover, enabled us to eventually estimate the uncertainties related to the use of the GIS method. These results will also be used to support a set of groundwater simulations based on MODFLOW code in the Bou Ahmad aquifer.

47,"Albanese, S",Jun 2013 ,Assessment of the environmental conditions of the Sarno river basin (south Italy): a stream sediment approach,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH,"The Sarno river basin covers an area of 500 km(2) collecting the waters of Solofrana and Cavaiola tributaries. Originally it manly represents a source of livelihood for inhabitants by fishing and transporting goods; currently, the Sarno river, still partially used for irrigation, is affected by an extreme environmental degradation as a result of uncontrolled outflow of industrial waste. Within the framework of a wider geochemical prospecting project aiming at characterizing the whole territory of the Campania region, 89 stream sediment samples with a sampling density of 1 sample per 5 km(2) were collected in the river basin and analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in order to assess the environmental conditions at a regional scale. A GIS-aided technique, based on both the actual distribution of potentially harmful elements and their regional background values, was used to generate the maps of the contamination factors and of the contamination degrees for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn. Furthermore, a factor analysis was performed to assess the nature and the extent of contamination sources for the river sediments. Results showed that the Sarno river basin could be divided in two ""environmental status"" units: one, low contaminated, corresponding to the hilly and mountain areas, and the second, from moderately to very highly contaminated, corresponding to the economically developed areas of the valley floor characterized by a high population density. This work was developed within a project that aims to investigate the relationships between environmental pollution and human health by analyzing environmental media (stream sediments, water, soil and vegetation) together with human hair of resident population. In this context, the spatial correlation between the extremely compromised environmental conditions of developed areas and the incidence rate of liver cancer in the same area was also explored posing the need of a careful costs/benefits analysis to assess whether the deterioration of the environment, that could adversely affect the conditions of public health, is worth the economic development.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000318864900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAssessment%2Bof%2Bthe%2Benvironmental%2Bconditions%2Bof%2Bthe%2BSarno%2Briver%2Bbasin%2B%2528south%2BItaly%2529%253A%2Ba%2Bstream%2Bsediment%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DStefano%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DAlbanese%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10653-012-9483-x%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2983%26rft.epage%3D297%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0269-4042%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BGEOCHEMISTRY%2BAND%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D283-297%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D283%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BGEOCHEM%2BHLTH%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DAlbanese%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DIavazzo%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DDe%2BVivo%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+GEOCHEMISTRY+AND+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Welsh, MK",Jan 3 2020 ,Stream and floodplain restoration impacts riparian zone hydrology of agricultural streams,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"While the influence of stream restoration on vertical and lateral hyporheic exchange has been documented, impacts on broader riparian zone hydrology have not been thoroughly investigated. We quantified riparian water table dynamics, hydraulic gradient, and groundwater flow paths and fluxes across a range of hydrologic conditions following natural channel design restoration (riparian regrading, in-channel cross-vane structure installation). Water table measurements were collected at least once per season for 2.5 years to capture water levels during baseflow conditions from networks of wells and piezometers at sites with different stream morphology (created riffle-cross-vane-scour pool complexes versus natural pools and riffles), restoration status (agricultural restored, unrestored, forested reference), and riparian characteristics (slope, soils, topography) in North Carolina, USA. The regraded riparian zone had higher near-stream water tables (< 0.5 m below ground surface) than the unrestored site. Riffle-cross-vane complexes induced a zone of low hydraulic gradient that spanned 30-40% of the riparian area, similar to groundwater dynamics near beaver dams. This effect persisted regardless of hydrologic condition (wet or dry) or scour pool status (functioning or filled-in). Riffles also promoted a lower near-stream hydraulic gradient at the forested site. Conversely, the influence of stream features on riparian groundwater was minimal at the unrestored site, where groundwater fluxes were controlled by hillslope inputs and riparian geomorphology. Overall, restoration enhanced stream-riparian zone hydrologic interaction beyond the immediate hyporheic zone. Our work stresses that cross-vanes, even when partially buried by sediments post-restoration, impact whole floodplain hydrology in a more significant way than shown by prior stream restoration studies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000514583700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStream%2Band%2Bfloodplain%2Brestoration%2Bimpacts%2Briparian%2Bzone%2Bhydrology%2Bof%2Bagricultural%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DMolly%2BK.%26rft.auinit%3DMK%26rft.aulast%3DWelsh%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10661-019-7795-3%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2959%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0167-6369%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMONITORING%2BAND%2BASSESSMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMONIT%2BASSESS%26rft.volume%3D192%26rft.au%3DWelsh%252C%2BMK%26rft.au%3DVidon%252C%2BPG%26rft.au%3DMcMillan%252C%2BSK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MONITORING+AND+ASSESSMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Zhang, JH",Nov 2019 ,"Water-Exchange Response of Downstream River-Lake System to the Flow Regulation of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China",WATER,"Hydrological regime changes in the river-lake system and their influences on the ecological environment downstream dams have attracted increasingly more attention all over the world. The Dongting lake downstream of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in the Yangtze River has been experiencing a series of hydraulic and hydrological changes over the last decade. The hydrological and ecological influences of the TGD flow regulation on the Dongting river-lake system and its functional mechanism during the impounding periods remain extremely unclear. This study examines the hydrological changes in the Dongting river-lake system based on a 1D/2D coupled hydrodynamic model. In particular, the inflow boundary of the model with and without the TGD was applied with the outflow and inflow of the TGD, respectively, during the same regulation periods. The results show that the diverted flow from the Yangtze River into the Dongting lake and outflow from the lake back to the river drastically decreased during the impounding periods, especially in October. The decreased water exchange between the Yangtze River and the Dongting lake impaired the water residence capacity to some extent in the lake. Stage decrease in the lake area resulted in a significant reduction in the water volume of the Dongting lake with the same time percentage. In addition, the obvious drainage effect in Dongting lake due to the increased stage difference and current speed after the TGD operation was the essential cause of hydrological changes in the lake area. These results provide an improvement in the understanding of impoundment influences on the large river-lake system and give some practical information for ecological environment management in similar river-lake systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000502264500196,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2394%26rft.atitle%3DWater-Exchange%2BResponse%2Bof%2BDownstream%2BRiver-Lake%2BSystem%2Bto%2Bthe%2BFlow%2BRegulation%2Bof%2Bthe%2BThree%2BGorges%2BReservoir%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DJunhong%26rft.auinit%3DJH%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw11112394%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BYP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FB6qKGEx7pPUPpORuxnW&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
