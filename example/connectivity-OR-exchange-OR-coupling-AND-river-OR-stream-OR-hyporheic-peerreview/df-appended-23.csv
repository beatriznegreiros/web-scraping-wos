0,0,"Becouze-Lareure, C",Jan 1 2016 ,Dynamics of toxicity within different compartments of a peri-urban river subject to combined sewer overflow discharges,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) in small pen-urban streams and rivers are potentially toxic for their biocenosis. Improving the management of CSO discharges requires better knowledge of their dynamics and toxicity. In view to characterizing this toxicity, we sampled the different compartments (benthic and hyporheic zone) of a pen-urban stream located near the city of Lyon in France. The samples were taken at different distances from a CSO and at three period characteristic of different hydrological conditions. Their toxic effects were assessed by bioassays on the dissolved fraction (D. magna, V. fished and B. calyciflorus bioassays) and on the particle fraction (V. fished and H. incongruens bioassays). The results highlighted significant toxicity of the particulate fraction for the benthic and hyporheic samples, in particular downstream of the CSO, but with high spatio-temporal variability. This variability can first be attributed to the variability of CSO discharge sampling as a function of season and rainfall, and the dynamics of polluted particles (trapping of transported particles in infiltration zones, mobilization during floods). These parameters play a fundamental role in the distribution of pollutants according to the geomorphology of stream facies. Regarding dissolved pollutants, the chemical exchanges taking place at the ""water-sediment"" interface trigger the transfer of pollutants from one phase to another, after which the dispersion of these pollutants is governed by hydraulic flows. Finally, critical zones and periods are identified for the pen-urban river toxicity studied: benthic sediments under mean flow downstream: hyporheic sediments after a storm event downstream, close to the CSO. Recommendations are made on the basis of the knowledge obtained to optimize the management of these discharges. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1,1,"Dong, L",Mar 2020 ,Distribution Characteristics and Spatial Differences of Phosphorus in the Main Stream of the Urban River Stretches of the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River,WATER,"Excessive phosphorus is the main problem of water pollution in the main stream of the Yangtze River, while it is not clear about the distribution characteristics and spatial differences of phosphorus in the urban river stretches of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In this study, a field survey in June 2014 revealed that the average particulate phosphorus (PP) concentration ranged from 0.195 mg/L to 0.105 mg/L from Wuhan (WH) in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to Shanghai (SH, 1081 km from WH) in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the average PP-to-the total phosphorus (TP) ratio decreased from 85.71% in WH to 45.65% in SH, while the average soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) concentration ranged from 0.033 to 0.125 mg/L, and the average SRP-to-total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) ratio increased from 60.73% in WH to 88.28% in SH. In general, PP was still an important form of TP in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The concentrations of PP and SRP at different sampling locations and water depths in the same monitoring section showed differences, which might be related to the transportation and sedimentation of suspended sediment (SS) and differences in the location of urban sewage outlets. Historical data showed that the concentration and particle size of the SS decreased over time, while the discharge of wastewater also increased over time in the Yangtze River Basin. The measured results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between SS and PP. As a result, the concentration of SRP might increase in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. If the SRP concentration is not properly controlled, the degree of eutrophication of water body could significantly increase in the Yangtze River estuary, the riparian zone of the urban river stretches, the tributary slow-flow section, and the corresponding lakes connected with the Yangtze River.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000529249500295,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B910%26rft.atitle%3DDistribution%2BCharacteristics%2Band%2BSpatial%2BDifferences%2Bof%2BPhosphorus%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMain%2BStream%2Bof%2Bthe%2BUrban%2BRiver%2BStretches%2Bof%2Bthe%2BMiddle%2Band%2BLower%2BReaches%2Bof%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DLei%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DDong%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12030910%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DDong%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DLin%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w12030910,"middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,urban river stretches,phosphorus,spatial distribution,bioavailability,suspended sediment (SS)","PARTICULATE PHOSPHORUS,BIOAVAILABILITY,NITROGEN,RESERVOIR,INPUTS,WATER,LAKES,MAINSTREAM,TRANSPORT,SEDIMENTS",,"Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Basin Water Environm Res Dept, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China"
2,2,"Guenther, SM",Jan 30 2014 ,Stream and bed temperature variability in a coastal headwater catchment: influences of surface-subsurface interactions and partial-retention forest harvesting,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream temperature was recorded between 2002 and 2005 at four sites in a coastal headwater catchment in British Columbia, Canada. Shallow groundwater temperatures, along with bed temperature profiles at depths of 1 to 30cm, were recorded at 10-min intervals in two hydrologically distinct reaches beginning in 2003 or 2004, depending on the site. The lower reach had smaller discharge contributions via lateral inflow from the hillslopes and fewer areas with upwelling (UW) and/or neutral flow across the stream bed compared to the middle reach. Bed temperatures were greater than those of shallow groundwater during summer, with higher temperatures in areas of downwelling (DW) flow compared to areas of neutral and UW flow. A paired-catchment analysis revealed that partial-retention forest harvesting in autumn 2004 resulted in higher daily maximum stream and bed temperatures but smaller changes in daily minima. Changes in daily maximum stream temperature, averaged over July and August of the post-harvest year, ranged from 1.6 to 3 degrees C at different locations within the cut block. Post-harvest changes in bed temperature in the lower reach were smaller than the changes in stream temperature, greater at sites with DW flow, and decreased with depth at both UW and DW sites, dropping to about 1 degrees C at a depth of 30cm. In the middle reach, changes in daily maximum bed temperature, averaged over July and August, were generally about 1 degrees C and did not vary significantly with depth. The pre-harvest regression models for shallow groundwater were not suitable for applying the paired-catchment analysis to estimate the effects of harvesting. However, shallow groundwater was warmer at the lower reach following harvesting, despite generally cooler weather compared to the pre-harvest year.

3,3,"Hart, DR",Jul 1999 ,Relationships between hydraulic parameters in a small stream under varying flow and seasonal conditions,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Twenty conservative tracer injections were carried, out in the same reach of a small woodland stream in order to determine how variation in discharge and leaf accumulation affect stream hydraulic parameters. The injections were made at various discharge rates ranging from 2.6 to 40 l/s. Five of the injections were made during late autumn, when there were large accumulations of leaves in the stream. Estimates of hydraulic parameters were made by fitting a transient storage solute transport model to conservative tracer concentration profiles. Velocity increased almost linearly with increasing discharge, indicating a decline in the Darcy friction factor. Dispersion also increased with increasing discharge, especially for the lower flow injections. The relative size of the storage zone was small (similar to 0.1). There was no definable relationship between discharge and the relative storage zone size, but the rates of exchange between the storage zone and the main channel increased markedly with increasing discharge. The presence of large accumulations of leaves had a clear effect on the hydraulic characteristics of the stream, producing much higher friction factors, larger storage zone sizes and lower velocity than would have been predicted by discharge alone.

4,4,"Wei, S",Aug 2022 ,A distributed domain model coupling open channel flow and groundwater flow to quantify the impact of lateral hydrologic exchange on hydrograph,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) of river-aquifer systems are known to affect water flow, but the quantitative influences of lateral HEFs and the riparian zone's hydraulic conductivity (K) distribution on stream fluxes remain obscure under varying hydrologic conditions. To fill this knowledge gap, this study proposed a physical based, distributed domain, coupled (open channel and groundwater) flow model (DDCM) to quantify the effect of lateral HEFs on hydrograph characteristics, including especially the peak discharge and tailing decay which are practically important. Numerical experiments showed that (1) the interaction between the lateral HEFs and river hydrodynamics reduced the peak discharge and flood flow rates, (2) a heterogeneous K field of the riparian zone generated multi-rate HEFs (which then changed flow response) represented by the hydrographs with various declining rates (varying from exponential to power-law), significantly expanding the flow process, and (3) the probability density function of K also affected the tailing and peak of the hydrograph. A preliminary test showed that the DDCM captured the overall pattern of hydrographs observed from a catchment in the Wadi Ahin West, Oman. This study, therefore, provided a model-based quantification of the mechanisms and factors of the lateral HEFs affecting the hydrograph pattern in flood events, and further applications are needed to test the applicability of the DDCM in capturing real-world hydrographs affected by the lateral HEFs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000811872900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B128010%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bdistributed%2Bdomain%2Bmodel%2Bcoupling%2Bopen%2Bchannel%2Bflow%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bflow%2Bto%2Bquantify%2Bthe%2Bimpact%2Bof%2Blateral%2Bhydrologic%2Bexchange%2Bon%2Bhydrograph%26rft.aufirst%3DSong%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DWei%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2022.128010%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D611%26rft.au%3DWei%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DZheng%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128010,"Lateral HEFs,Distributed-domain coupling model,Spatial heterogeneity,Power-law decay,Multi-rate flow","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,BANK STORAGE,STREAM CHEMISTRY,TRANSPORT,DISCHARGE,EVENTS,SIMULATION,CATCHMENT",,"Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China"
5,5,"Shuai, P",Sep 2017 ,"Denitrification in the banks of fluctuating rivers: The effects of river stage amplitude, sediment hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity, and ambient groundwater flow",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange induced by periodic river fluctuations leads to important biogeochemical processes, particularly nitrogen cycling, in riparian zones (RZs) where chemically distinct surface water and groundwater mix. We developed a two-dimensional coupled flow, reactive transport model to study the role of bank storage induced by river fluctuations on removing river-borne nitrate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantify the effects of river amplitude, sediment hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity, and ambient groundwater flow on nitrate removal rate. The simulations showed that nitrification occurred in the shallower zone adjacent to the bank where oxic river water and groundwater interacted while denitrification occurred deeper into the aquifer and in the riverbed sediments where oxygen was depleted. River fluctuations greatly increased the amount of nitrate being removed; the nitrate removal rate increased as river amplitude increased. Similarly, increasing hydraulic conductivity increased overall nitrate removal since it expanded the denitrifying zone but decreased efficiency. In contrast, increasing sediment dispersivity increased the removal efficiency of nitrate because it promoted mixing between electron acceptors and donors. The presence and direction of ambient groundwater flow had a significant impact on nitrate removal rate when compared to neutral conditions. A losing river showed a larger nitrate removal rate, whereas a gaining river showed a smaller nitrate removal rate. Our results demonstrated that daily river fluctuations created denitrification hot spots within the RZ that would not otherwise exist under naturally neutral or gaining conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000413484200026,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDenitrification%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bbanks%2Bof%2Bfluctuating%2Brivers%253A%2BThe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Briver%2Bstage%2Bamplitude%252C%2Bsediment%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Band%2Bdispersivity%252C%2Band%2Bambient%2Bgroundwater%2Bflow%26rft.aufirst%3DPin%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DShuai%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR020610%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7967%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7951-7967%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7951%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DShuai%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DNeilson%252C%2BBT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017WR020610,"riparian zone,denitrification,numerical modeling,river fluctuation,riverbank aquifer,dam regulation","INDUCED HYPORHEIC ZONES,FRESH-WATER ZONE,NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,PERMEABLE SEDIMENTS,TRANSPORT MODEL,ORGANIC-CARBON,RIPARIAN ZONE,POROUS-MEDIA,BED RIVER,NUTRIENT",,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA"
6,6,"Fritz, KM",Apr 2018 ,Physical and Chemical Connectivity of Streams and Riparian Wetlands to Downstream Waters: A Synthesis,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Streams, riparian areas, floodplains, alluvial aquifers, and downstream waters (e.g., large rivers, lakes, and oceans) are interconnected by longitudinal, lateral, and vertical fluxes of water, other materials, and energy. Collectively, these interconnected waters are called fluvial hydrosystems. Physical and chemical connectivity within fluvial hydrosystems is created by the transport of nonliving materials (e.g., water, sediment, nutrients, and contaminants) which either do or do not chemically change (chemical and physical connections, respectively). A substantial body of evidence unequivocally demonstrates physical and chemical connectivity between streams and riparian wetlands and downstream waters. Streams and riparian wetlands are structurally connected to downstream waters through the network of continuous channels and floodplain form that make these systems physically contiguous, and the very existence of these structures provides strong geomorphologic evidence for connectivity. Functional connections between streams and riparian wetlands and their downstream waters vary geographically and over time, based on proximity, relative size, environmental setting, material disparity, and intervening units. Because of the complexity and dynamic nature of connections among fluvial hydrosystem units, a complete accounting of the physical and chemical connections and their consequences to downstream waters should aggregate over multiple years to decades.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000428882400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPhysical%2Band%2BChemical%2BConnectivity%2Bof%2BStreams%2Band%2BRiparian%2BWetlands%2Bto%2BDownstream%2BWaters%253A%2BA%2BSynthesis%26rft.aufirst%3DKen%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DKM%26rft.aulast%3DFritz%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.12632%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D345%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D323-345%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D323%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DFritz%252C%2BKM%26rft.au%3DSchofield%252C%2BKA%26rft.au%3DPollard%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/1752-1688.12632,"hydrologic connectivity,functional connectivity,river networks,streams,riparian,floodplain wetlands,fluvial hydrosystems","CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS,ORGANIC-CARBON,SEDIMENT TRANSPORT,NETWORK GEOMETRY,FLOOD PULSE,HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY,EPHEMERAL TRIBUTARY,ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS,HEADWATER STREAMS,HYPORHEIC ZONE",,"US EPA, NERL, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA"
7,7,"Saleh, F",Apr 11 2011 ,Modeling the impact of in-stream water level fluctuations on stream-aquifer interactions at the regional scale,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The main objective of this study is to provide a realistic simulation of river stage in regional river networks in order to improve stream-aquifer interactions and better assess stream discharge and hydraulic head in aquifer units.The study focuses on the Oise basin (a 17,000 km(2) sub-basin of the Seine River basin, in Northern France). An upscaling method is proposed to benefit from high resolution hydraulic modeling at local scale to improve the simulation of river stages at regional scale. The methodology is based on simulation of the main rivers with a 1D Saint-Venant approach, from which functional stage-discharge relationships, are derived and projected onto each grid-cell of the regional model.At regional scale, the rating curves are used as boundary conditions and allow to calculate river stage, which is then used to calculate the exchanges between aquifer units and river. The approach is efficient to better simulate water pathways and stream-aquifer interactions at regional scale with low computing cost.The model was used to quantify stream to aquifer exchanges, that are in average 39 mm yr(-1) for aquifer to stream fluxes and 2 mm yr(-1) for stream to aquifer fluxes, mainly due to storage in aquifer units during storm events.

8,8,"Sunjidmaa, N",Sep 1 2022 ,Carbon limitation may override fine-sediment induced alterations of hyporheic nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The hyporheic zone underneath stream channels is considered a biogeochemical hotspot reducing nutrient loads being transported downstream due to its high surface-to-volume ratio in combination with the hyporheic exchange. However, the effect of environmental stressors such as high amounts of fine sediment (FS; grain size <0.2 mm) on nutrient cycling in the hyporheic zone are not well understood. Physical clogging caused by fine sediment (FS) decreases the hyporheic exchange, thus, diminishing its potential to reduce nutrient loads despite increasing its surface-to-volume ratio. We determined the effect of physical clogging on nutrient cycling based on net change rates of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; nitrate-N, ammonium-N), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for a sand and gravel hyporheic zone. We performed three experimental runs in 12 flumes with four-week duration each following a factorial design. First, we determined nutrient cycling in sand and gravel in absence of clogging, and then tested the clogging effect for each sediment type under increasing clogging (0-480 g of FS addition increasing by 60 g per level). Without clogging, gravel acted as a source of nitrate-N; and both sand and gravel released SRP. Regardless of the clogging level and the resulting reduced hyporheic exchange, we found no changes in DOC and nitrate-N dynamics but net-release of ammonium-N and SRP for gravel. In contrast, in sand, physical clogging inhibited DOC release for flumes with the higher FS. We propose that not physical clogging but DOC availability limited the nutrient uptake, as molar ratios of DOC to DIN and SRP ranged 1.2-1.5 and 77-191, respectively, indicating severe C limitation of N-uptake and partial C limitation of P-uptake. Our results suggest an interplay between nutrient molar ratios and physical clogging, which emphasize the interactions between hydrology and the stoichiometry of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000806055400005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B155689%26rft.atitle%3DCarbon%2Blimitation%2Bmay%2Boverride%2Bfine-sediment%2Binduced%2Balterations%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bnitrogen%2Band%2Bphosphorus%2Bdynamics%26rft.aufirst%3DNergui%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DSunjidmaa%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.scitotenv.2022.155689%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1026%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0048-9697%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENCE%2BOF%2BTHE%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D837%26rft.au%3DSunjidmaa%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DMendoza-Lera%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DGraeber%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=SCIENCE+OF+THE+TOTAL+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155689,"Physical clogging,Nutrient net-uptake,Mesocosm experiment,Gravel and sand bed sediment","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,MICROBIAL PROCESSES,TRANSIENT STORAGE,SOLUTE DYNAMICS,NITRATE REMOVAL,UPTAKE LENGTH,STREAM,NUTRIENT,ZONE,DENITRIFICATION",,"Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Aquat Ecosyst Anal, Bruckstrasse 3a, D-39114 Magdeburg, Germany"

The watershed, which drains 76,000 km(2) , is heavily populated with 18 10(6) inhabitants and is thus submitted to large anthropic pressure. The offline coupling of two Reactive Transport Models is used to understand the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon, oxygen and nutrients and quantify the CO2 exchange at the air-water interface along the main axis of the river. The estuarine section of the Seine is simulated by the generic estuarine model C-GEM (for Carbon Generic Estuarine Model), while the upstream part of the network, devoid of tidal influence is simulated by the pyNuts-Riverstrahler modeling platform which also includes an explicit representation of the drainage network ecological functioning. Our simulations provide a process-based representation of nutrients, oxygen, total organic carbon (TOC) and the carbonate system (DIC and alkalinity) over the entire year 2010. Our coupled modeling chain allows quantifying the respective contributions of the estuarine and freshwater sections of the system in the removal of carbon as well as following the fate of TOC and DIC along the river network. Our results also allow calculating an integrated carbon budget of the Seine river network for year 2010.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000467012000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B216%26rft.atitle%3DCarbon%2BDynamics%2BAlong%2Bthe%2BSeine%2BRiver%2BNetwork%253A%2BInsight%2BFrom%2Ba%2BCoupled%2BEstuarine%252FRiver%2BModeling%2BApproach%26rft.aufirst%3DGoulven%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DGG%26rft.aulast%3DLaruelle%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffmars.2019.00216%26rft.eissn%3D2296-7745%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BMARINE%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BMAR%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D6%26rft.au%3DLaruelle%252C%2BGG%26rft.au%3DMarescaux%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DThieu%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+MARINE+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/fmars.2019.00216,"dissolved inorganic and organic carbon,carbon dioxide,reactive-transport model,Seine river and estuary,biogeochemical budget","PHYTOPLANKTON DEVELOPMENT,NUTRIENT FLUXES,NORTH-SEA,CO2,ESTUARY,FRANCE,EUTROPHICATION,BUDGETS,DIOXIDE,WATERS",,"Sorbonne Univ, IPSL, UMR Metis 7619, CNRS,EPHE, Paris, France"
10,10,"Hall, RO",Nov 2009 ,"Hydrologic control of nitrogen removal, storage, and export in a mountain stream",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Nutrient cycling and export in streams and rivers should vary with flow regime, yet most studies of stream nutrient transformation do not include hydrologic variability. We used a stable isotope tracer of nitrogen (N-15) to measure nitrate (NO3-) uptake, storage, and export in a mountain stream, Spring Creek, Idaho, U. S. A. We conducted two tracer tests of 2-week duration during snowmelt and baseflow. Dissolved and particulate forms of N-15 were monitored over three seasons to test the hypothesis that stream N cycling would be dominated by export during floods, and storage during low flow. Floods exported more N than during baseflow conditions; however, snowmelt floods had higher than expected demand for NO3- because of hyporheic exchange. Residence times of benthic N during both tracer tests were longer than 100 d for ephemeral pools such as benthic algae and wood biofilms. Residence times were much longer in fine detritus, insects, and the particulate N from the hyporheic zone, showing that assimilation and hydrologic storage can be important mechanisms for retaining particulate N. Of the tracer N stored in the stream, the primary form of export was via seston during periods of high flows, produced by summer rainstorms or spring snowmelt the following year. Spring Creek is not necessarily a conduit for nutrients during high flow; hydrologic exchange between the stream and its valley represents an important storage mechanism.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000270390200026,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bcontrol%2Bof%2Bnitrogen%2Bremoval%252C%2Bstorage%252C%2Band%2Bexport%2Bin%2Ba%2Bmountain%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BO.%26rft.auinit%3DRO%26rft.aulast%3DHall%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.2009.54.6.2128%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D2142%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2128-2142%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2128%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO%26rft.au%3DBaker%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DKoch%252C%2BBJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.2009.54.6.2128,,"DESERT STREAM,FOREST STREAM,NITRATE REMOVAL,DENITRIFICATION,RETENTION,TRANSPORT,TRANSFORMATION,WATERSHEDS,DYNAMICS,QUANTIFICATION",,"Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA"

Nutrient. storage within, and export from, the river reach, was quantified to assess the impact of WWTP effluent on nutrient dynamics.More than 98% of N and P storage was found in he surficial river bed sediment, where it is available to support epilithic algal and macrophyte growth. Nutrient export from the river reach by sediment, hyporheic water, and biomass were small compared to water column transport. The N:P ratios for the five different compartments suggested that the wafer column was severely P limited, whereas sediment, hyporheic water, and aquatic biomass tended towards co-limitation and N limitation.Within the river reach, he majority of P was stored immediately downstream of he WWTP effluent outfall, whereas N was retained at a higher rate relative to Pin the remainder of the reach. Correlation analysis of nutrient exchange between different compartments suggested that multiple nutrient compartments should be considered when establishing nutrient loading criteria. Nutrient analysis in multiple compartments in the river can add valuable insight into nutrient dynamics and nutrient limitation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

12,12,"Dai, ML",Dec 2017 ,Impact of the Three Gorges Project operation on the water exchange between Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,"The Three Gorges Project (TGP) is a world known project to utilize and manage the water resources of the Yangtze River. The reservoir stores water at the end of the flood season, and replenishes downstream reaches with water in dry seasons. In addition to such benefits, the TGP has irreversibly changed the hydrological process and the river-lake relation of the middle and lower reaches. In this paper, a hydrodynamic model was established to quantify the impact of the TGP's operation on the water exchange between Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River during 2009-2013. The results indicated that: the operation of the TGP has considerably reduced the peak discharge and the flood volume of the main stream and the Dongting Lake area. The inflow volume from the Yangtze River to Dongting Lake via three outlets decreased by 1.9-3.5 billion m(3)/yr, while the outflow volume from Dongting Lake to the Yangtze River at Chenglingji increased by 0.3-1.6 billion m(3) in September and 0.4-0.6 billion m(3) in October, respectively. This research provides valuable information for flood control, irrigation, and water allocation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and serves as a typical case for investigating the impact of other hydropower projects around the world.

13,13,"Shogren, AJ",Mar 1 2020 ,Controls on fine particle retention in experimental streams,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The transport and retention of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) in headwater streams plays a significant role in organic matter processing and represents a critical link between upstream and downstream systems. Benthic biofilms potentially alter substrate characteristics and dynamics. However, the influence of biofilm colonization on FPOM retention has not been well documented, likely due to inherent heterogeneity of natural systems. We expected that biofilm growth would either enhance or diminish FPOM retention in the streambed, whereas biofilm growth would vary depending on the underlying substrate template. We used a short-term FPOM addition technique to estimate transport distances of a fine particle analog (corn pollen: 70 mu m) in four 50-m experimental streams (Q = 1.5 L/s) at the Notre Dame Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility. Streams varied in substrate size (1-cm pea gravel vs 10-cm small cobble) and complexity (homogenous 50/50 mix vs alternating sections). We sampled streams on multiple dates over 5 mo (June-October) of biofilm colonization and senescence. While FPOM transport distances generally increased as biofilm colonization occurred, retention was variable across streams and over time. We found no consistent or simple pattern of FPOM retention in our streams. Rather, one of the strongest effects was an indirect relationship between FPOM removal and transient storage, a factor that is strongly driven by biofilm colonization.

14,14,"Cho, EB",May 2020 ,"Enhanced Exchange Flow During Spring Tide and Its Cause in the Sumjin River Estuary, Korea",ESTUARIES AND COASTS,"Knowledge of exchange flow and its variations is important, because it determines the distribution of salt, nutrient, pollutant, and suspended sediment in estuaries. Although exchange flow has been studied extensively, their variations over the spring-neap tidal cycle remain unclear. Many studies have indicated that the exchange flow is weaker during spring tides than neap tides, but others have reported that it might be stronger during spring tides. Therefore, we investigated the spring-neap variation of an exchange flow and its cause based on intensive observational data and an analytical model applied to the Sumjin River estuary (SRE), Korea. The observations revealed that exchange flow increased during the spring tide but decreased during the neap tide. The horizontal salinity gradient increased about seven times more during spring tide than during neap tide in the middle of the estuary. The analytical model implied that the exchange flow in the SRE is mainly driven by the horizontal salinity gradient. The large horizontal salinity gradient and tidal current amplitude ratio in the SRE between the spring and neap tides suggests that the horizontal pressure gradient driven by the salinity gradient overwhelms vertical mixing in driving exchange flow in the SRE.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000492363300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEnhanced%2BExchange%2BFlow%2BDuring%2BSpring%2BTide%2Band%2BIts%2BCause%2Bin%2Bthe%2BSumjin%2BRiver%2BEstuary%252C%2BKorea%26rft.aufirst%3DEun-Byeol%26rft.auinit%3DEB%26rft.aulast%3DCho%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12237-019-00636-9%26rft.eissn%3D1559-2731%26rft.epage%3D534%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1559-2723%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DESTUARIES%2BAND%2BCOASTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D525-534%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D525%26rft.stitle%3DESTUAR%2BCOAST%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DCho%252C%2BEB%26rft.au%3DCho%252C%2BYK%26rft.au%3DKim%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=ESTUARIES+AND+COASTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12237-019-00636-9,"Exchange flow,Salinity gradient,Sumjin River estuary,Tide","RELATIVE IMPORTANCE,RESIDUAL FLOWS,CIRCULATION,VARIABILITY,REMOTE,STRATIFICATION,MODULATION,SALINITY,DYNAMICS,BAY",,"Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Res Inst Oceanog, Seoul 151742, South Korea"

The new class of single-pass connected components analysis (CCA) algorithms (where a feature vector of each component is extracted during processing) are analysed and compared within this context. Such algorithms have been developed for stream processing, using customised hardware architectures. Many of these use an improved union-find algorithm requiring only a single lookup for its find operation. This paper analyses this optimisation and formally proves that the resulting single lookup connected components algorithm associates each pixel with its correct component when extracting the components' feature vectors. Analysis of the algorithm led to a new double lookup algorithm that reduces the total number of memory accesses and is a step towards unifying pixel-based methods and run-based methods. State-of-the-art CCA algorithms are compared in terms of the number of memory accesses, which is a limiting factor for hardware-based acceleration, with key implementation trade-offs identified between hardware resources and worst-case processing speed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000486310600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DComparative%2BStudy%2Band%2BProof%2Bof%2BSingle-Pass%2BConnected%2BComponents%2BAlgorithms%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DKlaiber%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10851-019-00891-2%26rft.eissn%3D1573-7683%26rft.epage%3D1134%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0924-9907%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMATHEMATICAL%2BIMAGING%2BAND%2BVISION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1112-1134%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1112%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BMATH%2BIMAGING%2BVIS%26rft.volume%3D61%26rft.au%3DKlaiber%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DBailey%252C%2BDG%26rft.au%3DSimon%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+MATHEMATICAL+IMAGING+AND+VISION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10851-019-00891-2,"Connected component analysis,Connected component labelling,Feature extraction,Union-find,Stream processing,FPGA,Hardware architecture",,,"Robert Bosch GmbH, Corp Res Campus, D-71272 Renningen, Germany"

The median value of seepage measured at 24 locations was 24 cm/day, but seepage measured at specific sites ranged from -340 to +237 cm/day. Seepage also varied substantially over periods of hours to days and occasionally reversed direction in response to evolution of the sediment bed. Vertical hydraulic conductivity was related to seepage direction and was larger during upward seepage than during downward seepage; with differences ranging from 4 to 40% in areas of active sediment transport to more than an order of magnitude in areas where current was too slow to mobilize bed sediment. Seepage was poorly related to hydraulic gradient measured over vertical distances of 0.3 m and appeared to be opposite the hydraulic gradient at 18% of the locations where both parameters were measured. Results demonstrate the scale dependence of these measurements in coarse-grained hyporheic settings and indicate that hydraulic gradients should be determined over a much shorter vertical increment if used to indicate exchange across the sediment-water interface.

17,17,"Sina, M",Apr 1 2020 ,WidePLive: a coupled low-delay overlay construction mechanism and peer-chunk priority-based chunk scheduling for P2P live video streaming,IET COMMUNICATIONS,"In recent years, peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming is popularised by the scalability and cost-effectiveness of P2P networks. User satisfaction in P2P live streaming systems depends on several factors, including chunk scheduling techniques and overlay construction mechanisms in these systems. P2P live streaming systems are involved with the peer and chunk selection problems to improve quality parameters of streaming, such as playback continuity, startup delay, and playback latency. In this study, WidePLive as a P2P live video streaming system is proposed. In WidePLive, the authors proposed a low-delay overlay construction mechanism and a mixed strategy based chunk scheduling scheme which are coupled together by a contribution-aware peer selection strategy as a coupling feature to improve the quality parameter. The proposed overlay construction mechanism allows new peers to have the opportunity to connect with previous peers near the server and forms a low-depth and low-delay overlay. The proposed chunk scheduling scheme uses the benefits of Rarest First and Greedy strategies to trade-off between quality parameters. The evaluation of WidePLive simulation results demonstrates an acceptable improvement in streaming performance and shows that WidePLive has lower startup delay and playback latency and higher playback continuity compared to previous works.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000526412600006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWidePLive%253A%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2Blow-delay%2Boverlay%2Bconstruction%2Bmechanism%2Band%2Bpeer-chunk%2Bpriority-based%2Bchunk%2Bscheduling%2Bfor%2BP2P%2Blive%2Bvideo%2Bstreaming%26rft.aufirst%3DMajid%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DSina%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1049%252Fiet-com.2019.0618%26rft.eissn%3D1751-8636%26rft.epage%3D947%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1751-8628%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DIET%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D937-947%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D937%26rft.stitle%3DIET%2BCOMMUN%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DSina%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DDehghan%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DReshadi%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=IET+COMMUNICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1049/iet-com.2019.0618,"video streaming,peer-to-peer computing,telecommunication scheduling,greedy algorithms,overlay construction mechanisms,chunk selection problems,quality parameter,P2P live video streaming system,mixed strategy based chunk scheduling scheme,contribution-aware peer selection strategy,coupling feature,low-depth,WidePLive simulation results,lower startup delay,higher playback continuity,peer-chunk priority-based chunk scheduling,peer-to-peer live streaming,chunk scheduling techniques,coupled low-delay overlay construction mechanism","NEIGHBOR SELECTION,NETWORK,SCHEME,DESIGN,MESH",,"Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran"

In each stream, surface (open) water and interstitial water form downwelling and Upwelling zones were considered. Interstitial habitats of most streams acted as a sink for nitrate, but as a source for ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). The nitrate sink persisted in shallow sediments of downwelling zones, while the source of ammonium and SRP persisted in deeper sediments of upwelling zones, where organic matter was decomposed and microbial uptake was lower than the production of nutrients. Geology (granite versus schist substratum) was the main variable controlling the nutrient contents and the microbial activity within interstitial habitats due to varying sediment grain size and hydraulic properties. Schist streams had the finest sediment grain size and lowest hydrologic connectivity between Surface water and interstitial habitats, and had the highest potential microbial activities, especially for denitrification. Land-use of the catchments (percentage of forested area), channel morphology (river incision), and local characteristics of the benthic sediment (partial clogging) also influenced nutrient concentrations and microbial activities irrespectively of the geology of the catchment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000233664300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNutrient%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Binterstitial%2Bhabitats%2Bof%2Blow-order%2Brural%2Bstreams%2Bwith%2Bdifferent%2Bbedrock%2Bgeology%26rft.aufirst%3DS%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DLefebvre%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F0003-9136%252F2005%252F0164-0169%26rft.epage%3D191%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D169-191%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D169%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D164%26rft.au%3DLefebvre%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DBaudry%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0164-0169,"agriculture,hyporheic zone,nitrogen,denitrification,land-use","FLUORESCEIN DIACETATE HYDROLYSIS,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,SURFACE-WATER,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,FOREST STREAM,DENITRIFICATION,GROUNDWATER,SEDIMENTS,RIPARIAN",,"Univ Rennes 1, UMR 6553, CNRS, Campus Beaulieu,263 Av Gen Leclerc,CS 74205, F-35042 Rennes, France"
19,19,"Zhu, J",2015 ,Nonlinear effects of locally heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields on regional stream-aquifer exchanges,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Computational experiments are performed to evaluate the effects of locally heterogeneous conductivity fields on regional exchanges of water between stream and aquifer systems in the Middle Heihe River basin (MHRB) of north-western China. The effects are found to be nonlinear in the sense that simulated discharges from aquifers to streams are systematically lower than discharges produced by a base model parameterized with relatively coarse effective conductivity. A similar, but weaker, effect is observed for stream leakage. The study is organized around three hypotheses: (H1) small-scale spatial variations of conductivity significantly affect regional exchanges of water between streams and aquifers in river basins, (H2) aggregating small-scale heterogeneities into regional effective parameters systematically biases estimates of stream-aquifer exchanges, and (H3) the biases result from slow paths in groundwater flow that emerge due to small-scale heterogeneities. The hypotheses are evaluated by comparing stream-aquifer fluxes produced by the base model to fluxes simulated using realizations of the MHRB characterized by local (grid-scale) heterogeneity. Levels of local heterogeneity are manipulated as control variables by adjusting coefficients of variation. All models are implemented using the MODFLOW (Modular Three-dimensional Finite-difference Groundwater Flow Model) simulation environment, and the PEST (parameter estimation) tool is used to calibrate effective conductivities defined over 16 zones within the MHRB. The effective parameters are also used as expected values to develop lognormally distributed conductivity (K) fields on local grid scales. Stream-aquifer exchanges are simulated with K fields at both scales and then compared. Results show that the effects of small-scale heterogeneities significantly influence exchanges with simulations based on local-scale heterogeneities always producing discharges that are less than those produced by the base model. Although aquifer heterogeneities are uncorrelated at local scales, they appear to induce coherent slow paths in groundwater fluxes that in turn reduce aquifer-stream exchanges. Since surface watergroundwater exchanges are critical hydrologic processes in basin-scale water budgets, these results also have implications for water resources management.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000365981100009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNonlinear%2Beffects%2Bof%2Blocally%2Bheterogeneous%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bfields%2Bon%2Bregional%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bexchanges%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DZhu%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-19-4531-2015%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D4545%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4531-4545%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4531%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DZhu%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DWinter%252C%2BCL%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/hess-19-4531-2015,,"HEIHE RIVER-BASIN,SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER INTERACTION,SPATIAL VARIABILITY,STOCHASTIC-ANALYSIS,GEOLOGIC MEDIA,FLOW,SCALE,MANAGEMENT,MODEL",,"Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA"
20,20,"Knighton, AD",Sep 1999 ,Downstream variation in stream power,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Stream power has a significant influence on many form and process attributes of the fluvial system. Using a similar approach to that suggested by D.M. Lawler in 1992 and 1995, a model is developed to explore how stream power might vary in the downstream direction, based on the assumption that the longitudinal profile of the river has an exponential form. No particular discharge is necessarily specified, but near-bankfull flows are regarded as significant morphologically and one such discharge is the focus here. Total stream power per unit channel length (Omega = gamma Qs) is predicted to peak at an intermediate location, the position of which depends on the ratio b/beta, where b and beta are the downstream rates of change of discharge and slope respectively. If b is a relatively conservative quantity, then the form of the longitudinal profile and in particular its degree of concavity will have the major influence on the position of maximum stream power. Specific stream power(omega = Omega/w) is even more sensitive to beta and is expected to peak closer to the headwaters, about half way between source and the location of the stream power maximum, although this will depend on how channel width (w) varies with distance from source. The model is tested along three connected streams of different size in the catchment of the River Trent, taking advantage of a relationship between mean annual flood and link magnitude which enables this near-bankfull discharge to be estimated at any point within the network. The model is verified in so far as stream power does attain a mid-basin maximum, but the observed and predicted locations of the maxima do not always correspond, largely because of the distinctive variation in discharge and especially slope along individual pathways. For example, maximum power lies far downstream along the Trent because of the large increase in mid-basin discharge associated with a series of large, closely spaced tributaries. The importance of slope is borne out by the near-headwater locations for specific power maxima, which tend to be further upstream than predicted along all three rivers as a result of the steepness of upper reaches. The variety of geomorphic settings produces deviations from expectation, which has implications for the movement and storage of material in the fluvial system. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

21,21,"Quichimbo, EA",Aug 30 2020 ,Characterising groundwater-surface water interactions in idealised ephemeral stream systems,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Transmission losses from the beds of ephemeral streams are thought to be a widespread mechanism of groundwater recharge in arid and semi-arid regions and support a range of dryland hydro-ecology. Dryland areas cover similar to 40% of the Earth's land surface and groundwater resources are often the main source of freshwater. It is commonly assumed that where an unsaturated zone exists beneath a stream, the interaction between surface water and groundwater is unidirectional and that groundwater does not exert a significant feedback on transmission losses. To test this assumption, we conducted a series of numerical model experiments using idealised two-dimensional channel-transects to assess the sensitivity and degree of interaction between surface and groundwater for typical dryland ephemeral stream geometries, hydraulic properties and flow regimes. We broaden the use of the term 'stream-aquifer interactions' to refer not just to fluxes and water exchange but also to include the ways in which the stream and aquifer have a hydraulic effect on one another. Our results indicate that deep water tables, less frequent streamflow events and/or highly permeable sediments tend to result in limited bi-directional hydraulic interaction between the stream and the underlying groundwater which, in turn, results in high amounts of infiltration. With shallower initial depth to the water table, higher streamflow frequency and/or lower bed permeability, greater 'negative' hydraulic feedback from the groundwater occurs which in turn results in lower amounts of infiltration. Streambed losses eventually reach a constant rate as initial water table depths increase, but only at depths of 10s of metres in some of the cases studied. Our results highlight that bi-directional stream-aquifer hydraulic interactions in ephemeral streams may be more widespread than is commonly assumed. We conclude that groundwater and surface water should be considered as connected systems for water resource management unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000547568300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCharacterising%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Bidealised%2Bephemeral%2Bstream%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DEdisson%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DEA%26rft.aulast%3DQuichimbo%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13847%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D3806%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D18%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3792-3806%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3792%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DQuichimbo%252C%2BEA%26rft.au%3DSinger%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DCuthbert%252C%2BMO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.13847,"dryland hydrology,ephemeral streams,groundwater recharge,stream-aquifer interactions","TRANSMISSION LOSSES,GLOBAL EVALUATION,HYPORHEIC ZONE,RIVER,DYNAMICS,FLOW,TRANSITION,INDICATORS,PATTERNS,EXCHANGE",,"Cardiff Univ, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Cardiff, Wales"
22,22,"Quick, AM",Apr 2019 ,Nitrous oxide from streams and rivers: A review of primary biogeochemical pathways and environmental variables,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,"Atmospheric concentrations of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) have increased dramatically over the last 100 years, and part of these emissions come from streams and rivers. N2O production has been more carefully studied in soils, but runoff of reactive nitrogen, likely from fertilizer, influences lotic N2O emissions. N2O production and consumption are strongly microbially mediated and mostly involve oxidation and reduction of the reactive nitrogen species ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite. Of the four main pathways leading to N2O production in soils and sediments, incomplete denitrification is likely the globally dominant N2O generating pathway and is favored by elevated nitrate concentrations, suboxic conditions, and sufficient organic carbon to promote reduction. The two pathways that oxidize ammonia, nitrifier denitrification and nitrification, are favored with higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen and ammonia. It is often difficult to distinguish these two pathways in field settings, but most evidence suggests that nitrifier-denitrification is likely the globally more significant of the two. The fourth reaction pathway is dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), in which N2O may be produced from intermediate nitrite. This pathway is more recently discovered, and its global relevance remains uncertain.The key variables influencing N2O cycling, concentrations of the primary reactants (nitrate and ammonia), organic carbon, and dissolved oxygen (DO), may vary temporally with season and time of day. Increasing nitrate and ammonia generally result in higher N2O production. Elevated carbon availability generally promotes denitrification. However, N2O yield is generally higher when carbon is less available or less reactive. Efforts to quantify N2O in lotic settings include mostly studies of N2O dissolved in or emitted from surface water, with fewer studies of N2O produced or emitted from sediments. With some exceptions and limits, N2O emissions are generally positively correlated with nitrate concentration (and in some cases, ammonia concentration). Most studies observe more N2O emissions with low DO. Lotic N2O emissions were generally higher in the warmer months and at night. Most studies assume a denitrification source for N2O, except in the case of high DO and NH4+, in which nitrification is assumed.Lotic N2O production and consumption may take place in the hyporheic zone along groundwater flow paths and in the water column of streams and rivers. Because microbial nitrogen processing requires substrate, influx of reactants, appropriate redox conditions, and intermediate residence times, the hyporheic zone is likely the site of most N2O production. However, high rates of N2O production may also occur associated with suspended sediments in turbid streams and rivers. Models that combine hydromorphogical and chemical variables are most likely to provide the best predictions of N2O emissions. Such models and some observations suggest that N2O emissions decrease downstream as sedimentary processes (likely denitrification) decrease relative to processes in the surface water (likely nitrification). Downstream sites could have large N2O emissions, however, due to inputs of nitrate or ammonia. Better quantification of lotic N2O processing will inform the emission factors incorporated into greenhouse gas budgets. Both quantification and mitigation of N2O emissions will benefit from future research that more closely examines the biogeochemical pathways and physical settings for N2O production and consumption.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000464771600012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNitrous%2Boxide%2Bfrom%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%253A%2BA%2Breview%2Bof%2Bprimary%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bpathways%2Band%2Benvironmental%2Bvariables%26rft.aufirst%3DAnnika%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DQuick%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.earscirev.2019.02.021%26rft.eissn%3D1872-6828%26rft.epage%3D262%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-8252%26rft.jtitle%3DEARTH-SCIENCE%2BREVIEWS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D224-262%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D224%26rft.stitle%3DEARTH-SCI%2BREV%26rft.volume%3D191%26rft.au%3DQuick%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DReeder%252C%2BWJ%26rft.au%3DBenner%252C%2BSG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=EARTH-SCIENCE+REVIEWS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.02.021,,"ANAEROBIC AMMONIUM OXIDATION,DISSIMILATORY NITRATE REDUCTION,GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE FLOW,UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER,WASTE-WATER TREATMENT,N2O EMISSIONS,FRESH-WATER,NITRIFIER DENITRIFICATION",,"Boise State Univ, Dept Geosci, Boise, ID 83725 USA"

The boundaries of this site are formed by an oxbow and the current bed of the river Spree, section Muggelspree. Surface and ground water levels were collected in 12 piezometers and at two recording stage gauges of a 300 m long transect throughout a one-year-period. Due to water level fluctuations, alternating periods of infiltration and exfiltration have been observed. However, most of the time groundwater flux is directed into the river Spree and river water infiltration events into the aquifer are usually short and of minor importance. Due to clogging of the oxbow bed, the hydraulic contact between the oxbow and the adjacent aquifer is marginal. These features are modelled quantitatively using MODFLOW in order to simulate ground water flow in the local aquifer.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000269912300004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExchange%2Bbetween%2Bground%2Bwater%2Band%2Bsurface%2Bwater%2Bat%2Bthe%2Blowland%2BRiver%2BSpree%26rft.aufirst%3DGunnar%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DNuetzmann%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00767-009-0110-4%26rft.eissn%3D1432-1165%26rft.epage%3D205%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1430-483X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DGRUNDWASSER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D195-205%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D195%26rft.stitle%3DGRUNDWASSER%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DNutzmann%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=GRUNDWASSER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00767-009-0110-4,"surface water,ground water,lowland river,flood plain,clogging,flow modelling","HYPORHEIC ZONE,FLOODPLAIN HYDROLOGY,TABLE FLUCTUATIONS,STREAMS,MODEL",,"Leibniz Inst Gewasserokol & Binnenfischerei, Abt Okohydrol, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany"

It is a typical Alpine river, flowing from Julian Alps. On entering Croatia, it becomes a typical lowland river. The possible influence of sediments of the sub-basins of Savinja, Krka and Kupa rivers on the sediments of the main course of Sava River was studied.Mineralogical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical composition by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Two different procedures to identify anomalous geochemical data, the box plot method and the median absolute deviation (MAD), were used.Results obtained by the box plot method showed that anomalous concentrations (extremes or outliers) of Zn, Ph, In, Cu, Co, Se, Zr, Cd, As, K, Na, Tl, Ba, B, Mn, and Fe are present in sediments of the Celje region, as well as of Cr, Ni, S, In, Cu, Mo, Ph in Moste dam (pollution traced down to Camping Sobec), and of Hg in Litija-Zagorje mining region. The MAD method is more sensitive, and depicts the same polluted areas, but with more anomalous values, which are above threshold values for toxicity.The results of the selected toxic elements, with concentrations limiting the quality of freshwater sediments, are particularly discussed. Both statistical methods (box plot detection method and MAD method) show two anomalous values for Hg in Sava River near Kranj and Zagorje. The concentrations are much higher than those causing significant toxic effects >>2 ppm. Two locations of Sava River in Croatia (Strelecko and Lukavec Posavski) show a very clean environment with respect to trace elements, although Sava River passed big cities of Zagreb and Sisak. The results clearly indicate self-purification mechanisms of Sava River.A similar future sediment study is recommended on middle and lower Sava drainage basin, of interest for Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, to detect possible pollution centers. In the case of significant pollution, remediation measures should be applied to improve sediment quality and management.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000254383900008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDetection%2Bof%2Bgeochemical%2Banomalies%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bsediments%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bupper%2BSava%2BRiver%2Bdrainage%2Bbasin%2B%2528Slovenia%252C%2BCroatia%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DStanislav%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFranciskovic-Bilinski%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft.eissn%3D1610-2304%26rft.epage%3D196%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1018-4619%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESENIUS%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BBULLETIN%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D188-196%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D188%26rft.stitle%3DFRESEN%2BENVIRON%2BBULL%26rft.volume%3D17&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=FRESENIUS+ENVIRONMENTAL+BULLETIN&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"chemical composition,geochemical anomalies,mineral composition,pollution,Sava River,self-purification,stream sediments","OLD METALLURGICAL AREA,QUALITY,SOIL",,"Rudjer Boskovic Inst, POB 180, Zagreb 10002, Croatia"

In order to gain a harmonious development among water resources and economic development in Lake Watershed, it is urgent to quantify the lake inflow. However, the calculation of inflow simulations is severely limited by the lack of information regarding river runoff. This paper attempts calculated inflow in an ungauged stream through use of the coupling water balance method and the Xin'anjiang model, applying it to calculate the inflow in the Chaohu Lake Basin, China. Results show that the coupled model has been proved to be robust in determining inflow in an ungauged stream. The error of daily inflow calculated by the water balance method is between 1.4 and -19.5%, which is within the standard error range (+/- 20%). The calibration and verification results of the coupled model suggest that the simulation results are best in the high inflow year (2016), followed by the normal inflow year (2007) and the low inflow year (1978). The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies for high inflow year, normal inflow year, and low inflow year are 0.82, 0.72, and 0.63, respectively, all of which have reached a satisfactory level. Further, the annual lake inflow simulation in the normal inflow year is 19.4 x 10(8) m(3), while the annual average land surface runoff of the study area is 18.9 x 10(8) m(3), and the relative error is -2.6% by the two ways. These results of the coupled model offer a new way to calculate the inflow in lake/reservoir basins.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000657308000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B615692%26rft.atitle%3DLake%2BInflow%2BSimulation%2BUsing%2Bthe%2BCoupled%2BWater%2BBalance%2BMethod%2Band%2BXin%2527anjiang%2BModel%2Bin%2Ban%2BUngauged%2BStream%2Bof%2BChaohu%2BLake%2BBasin%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DZijun%26rft.auinit%3DZJ%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffeart.2021.615692%26rft.eissn%3D2296-6463%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BEARTH%2BSC-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BZJ%26rft.au%3DLei%252C%2BXH%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+EARTH+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/feart.2021.615692,"ungauged stream,bivariate model,coupled water balance and Xin'anjiang model,lake inflows simulate,Chaohu Lake Basin","RAIN-GAUGE DENSITY,HYDROLOGICAL MODEL,RUNOFF,CALIBRATION,IMPROVEMENT",,"China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, Peoples R China"
27,27,"Withers, PJA",Aug 1 2008 ,Delivery and cycling of phosphorus in rivers: A review,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Phosphorus (P) supply (concentration and flux) is an important driver for biological activity in flowing waters and needs to be managed to avoid eutrophication impacts associated with urbanisation and agricultural intensification. This paper examines the role of in-stream retention and cycling in regulating river P concentrations in order to better understand the links between P sources and their ecological impacts. In terms of their composition (solubility and concentration), patterns of delivery (mode and timing) and therefore ecological relevance, P sources entering rivers are best grouped into wastewater discharges > runoff from impervious surfaces (roads, farmyards) > runoff from pervious surfaces (forestry, cultivated land and pasture). The localized impacts of soluble P discharges during ecologically sensitive periods can be distinguished from the downstream impacts associated with particulate P discharges under high flows due to the different processes by which these sources are retained, transformed and assimilated within the river channel. The range of physico-chemical processes involved in P cycling and the variable importance of these processes in different river environments according to stream size, stream geomorphology and anthropogenic pressures are summarised. It is concluded that the capacity to retain (process) P within the river channel, and hence regulate the downstream delivery of P without stressing the aquatic communities present, is considerable, especially in headwaters. To help achieve good water quality, there is scope to better manage this ecosystem service through regulation of P supply whilst optimising in-stream P retention according to subsidy-stress theory.

We evaluated the ecosystem effects of river widening to improve sediment relations in the Thur River, Switzerland, 12 years after implementation. We tested if restored and non-restored reaches differed in water physico-chemistry, hyporheic function, primary production, and macroinvertebrate density and composition in relation to the flow regime. Our results showed that (i) spatio-temporal variation in sediment respiration and macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness were driven by interactions between restoration and flow; (ii) riverbed conditions including substrate size, organic matter content, and groundwater-surface water exchange changed due to restoration, but (iii) physico-chemistry, hydraulic conditions, and primary production were not altered by restoration. Importantly, our study revealed that abiotic conditions, except channel morphology, changed only marginally, whereas other ecosystem attributes responded markedly to changes in flow-restoration interactions. These results highlight integrating a more holistic ecosystem perspective in the design and monitoring of restoration projects such as river widening in resource management, preferably in relation to flow-sediment regimes and interactions with the biotic components of the ecosystem.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434954900093,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B439%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluation%2Bof%2BRestoration%2Band%2BFlow%2BInteractions%2Bon%2BRiver%2BStructure%2Band%2BFunction%253A%2BChannel%2BWidening%2Bof%2Bthe%2BThur%2BRiver%252C%2BSwitzerland%26rft.aufirst%3DEduardo%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DEJ%26rft.aulast%3DMartin%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw10040439%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DMartin%252C%2BEJ%26rft.au%3DRyo%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DRobinson%252C%2BCT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w10040439,"flow regime,river restoration,sediment regime,sediment respiration,periphyton,macroinvertebrates,ecosystem structure and function,channelization","ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,EXPERIMENTAL FLOODS,HYPORHEIC ZONE,STREAM,HABITAT,SEDIMENT,EXCHANGE,HETEROGENEITY,VARIABILITY,DISTURBANCE",,"EAWAG, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland"

30,30,"Cranswick, RH",Nov 27 2014 ,Hyporheic zone exchange fluxes and residence times inferred from riverbed temperature and radon data,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Vertical profiles of temperature, radon and electrical conductivity are used to characterise downwelling, neutral and upwelling hyporheic zones along a pool-riffle sequence in the Haughton River in north-eastern Australia. Water residence times and vertical fluxes are derived from temperature and radon data and then directly compared for downwelling profiles. Temperature and radon-derived fluxes in downwelling zones ranged from 0.02 to 24 m day(-1) with a mean of 1.69 m day(-1) while residence times across the study site ranged from tens of minutes to greater than 15 days. The radon approach has the lowest uncertainty for residence times between 0.1 and 15 days while the uncertainty of the temperature approach (using a diel river signal) is lowest for residence times that are less than a few days. For 83% of depths in downwelling profiles, radon-derived residence times were greater (some up to two orders of magnitude greater) than temperature-derived residence times. When the error bounds of the residence time estimates were accounted for, 57% of radon-derived residence times were considerably greater than temperature-derived residence times in downwelling profiles. We suggest that this disparity is due to the different influence of small scale heterogeneity on temperature and radon transport. These field based results indicate that small scale heterogeneity may play a far more important role than has been previously considered in groundwater-surface water interaction studies.

31,31,"Mao, JQ",Dec 2016 ,Optimal operation of a multi-reservoir system for environmental water demand of a river-connected lake,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,"Dongting Lake, a large river-connected lake in the Yangtze River watershed, plays important roles in flood control, drought mitigation, and biodiversity conservation. Its ecosystem has recently been severely affected by upstream water resource development such as reservoir operations. In this study, an optimization model is developed for the operation of a multi-reservoir system, including the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) on the upper Yangtze River and 8 major reservoirs on the tributaries to Dongting Lake. The optimal target in pursuit of the ecological objective is to maximize the environmental water demand (EWD) satisfaction of the lake. A support vector regression-based model is used to predict the response of the lake level to reservoir operations. The optimization is carried out under different scenarios for both normal and dry conditions, and the results show that: (i) the existing operation policy could result in significant hydrologic alteration; (ii) in the normal condition, the proposed optimal joint operation policy could increase the general EWD satisfaction rate of Dongting Lake from 85.4% to 95.7%; and (iii) the improvement of EWD satisfaction in the normal condition is mainly affected by the TGR, while in the dry condition, the southern and western lake regions are more sensitive to the tributaries' reservoirs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000391003300015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOptimal%2Boperation%2Bof%2Ba%2Bmulti-reservoir%2Bsystem%2Bfor%2Benvironmental%2Bwater%2Bdemand%2Bof%2Ba%2Briver-connected%2Blake%26rft.aufirst%3DJingqiao%26rft.auinit%3DJQ%26rft.aulast%3DMao%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fnh.2016.043%26rft.eissn%3D2224-7955%26rft.epage%3D224%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-1277%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D206-224%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D206%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DMao%252C%2BJQ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BPP%26rft.au%3DHu%252C%2BTF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/nh.2016.043,"Dongting Lake,environmental water demand,multi-reservoir system,optimal operation,river-connected lake","3 GORGES RESERVOIR,MULTIRESERVOIR SYSTEMS,DONGTING LAKE,HYDROPOWER,CATCHMENT,MODELS,CHINA",,"Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
32,32,"Berthelsen, A",Aug 2020 ,Relationships in ecological health between connected stream and estuary ecosystems,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Estuaries are the endpoints of rivers, which shape their physical and biological characteristics, yet few tools are available to link the health of estuaries to their upstream sources. As a first step towards the use of macroinvertebrate indices for setting ecological health thresholds in streams that also protect estuaries, we examined relationships between the ecological health of streams and their receiving estuaries over a wide geographic scale in New Zealand. Eight macroinvertebrate biotic indices known to respond to key physico-chemical stressors (fine sediment, organic enrichment and metals) were used. We explored whether correlation strength between the stream and estuary indices varied with survey time difference (i.e., the number of years the stream survey was conducted prior to the estuary survey) and estuary type at the catchment/estuary scale. Significant positive correlations (rho= 0.30-0.78) were detected between many of the stream and estuary indices responding to fine sediment and (either) organic enrichment. Index correlation strength tended to increase with increasing survey time difference (usually up to at least a decade), indicating a temporal lag in ecological health between the streams and estuaries. Correlation strength also varied across estuary type and there was at least one moderate correlation for each of three types (deep and shallow drowned estuaries, tidal lagoons) representing a variety of geomorphological characteristics. We also used linear mixed models to determine the influence of estuary and stream characteristics, as well as survey time difference, on index relationship strength. The relationships were influenced by estuary site location and volume, and survey time difference. For spatially integrated management purposes, our results are a step towards demonstrating that macroinvertebrate indices could be used to set ecological thresholds for streams and that also consider protection of estuary health from impacts of fine sediment and organic enrichment. Overall, our study highlights the value of using biotic indices to compare the ecological health of connected ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000561438700006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B106374%26rft.atitle%3DRelationships%2Bin%2Becological%2Bhealth%2Bbetween%2Bconnected%2Bstream%2Band%2Bestuary%2Becosystems%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DBerthelsen%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecolind.2020.106374%26rft.eissn%3D1872-7034%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1470-160X%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BINDICATORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BINDIC%26rft.volume%3D115%26rft.au%3DBerthelsen%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DCasanovas%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DSinner%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+INDICATORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106374,"Biotic index,Connectivity,Ecological threshold,Environmental stressor,Integrated management,Macroinvertebrate","MARINE BIOTIC INDEX,FRESH-WATER,LAND-USE,CLIMATE-CHANGE,MULTIPLE STRESSORS,COASTAL,SEDIMENT,NUTRIENT,CATCHMENT,INTEGRITY",,"Cawthron Inst, Private Bag 2, Nelson 7042, New Zealand"

Discharge regime at Fuirosos is strongly related to the precipitation regime and showed, during the entire study period, a significant decrease, at a rate of -0.4 L/s/y which represents 1.3 % of the estimated average discharge. Further, drought duration is lengthening at a rate of 1.9 d/y, mainly as a consequence of delay of the rewetting phase. Overall, if these trends continue at their current rates, Fuirosos will be converted into an ephemeral stream during the second half of this century. Fuirosos is at the center of an intense research activity focused on the ecology of this aquatic ecosystem. Research topics range from measuring microbial processes in sand sediments to analyzing solute responses under extreme flow conditions (flood and droughts), including metabolism measurements, nutrient retention balances, macro-benthos diversity and leaf inputs in stream reaches or water/solute exchange at the stream-hyporheic interface. Most of these studies revealed that its ecology is related unequivocally to the hydrological regime.

This has the potential to influence denitrification ratesin particular by increasing the coupling of nitrification and denitrification. To further understand this, we numerically modeled nitrogen cycling under migrating ripples. While the simulated oxygen profiles match with expected behavior, almost no effect on denitrification or coupled nitrification-denitrification was observed with increasing celerity. Instead, denitrification rates were dominantly controlled by the flow velocity of water overlying the sediment.Key PointsShow less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000353046200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bnegligible%2Beffect%2Bof%2Bbed%2Bform%2Bmigration%2Bon%2Bdenitrification%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%2Bof%2Bpermeable%2Bsediments%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DKessler%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014JG002852%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D548%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D538-548%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D538%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D120%26rft.au%3DKessler%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DCook%252C%2BPLM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014JG002852,"permeable sediments,denitrification,hyporheic zone,reactive transport,migrating bed forms,groundwater hydrology","MARINE-SEDIMENTS,ADVECTIVE TRANSPORT,OXYGEN DYNAMICS,FLOW VELOCITY,IMPACT,FLUXES,GROUNDWATER,NITRATE",,"Monash Univ, Water Studies Ctr, Clayton, Vic, Australia"
35,35,"Constantz, J",Jul 1998 ,"Interaction between stream temperature, streamflow, and groundwater exchanges in Alpine streams",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Four alpine streams were monitored to continuously collect stream temperature and streamflow for periods ranging from a week to a year. In a small stream in the Colorado Rockies, diurnal variations in both stream temperature and streamflow were significantly greater in losing reaches than in gaining reaches, with minimum streamflow losses occurring early in the day and maximum losses occurring early in the evening. Using measured stream temperature changes, diurnal streambed infiltration rates were predicted to increase as much as 35% during the day (based on a heat and water transport groundwater model), while the measured increase in streamflow loss was 40%. For two large streams in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, annual stream temperature variations ranged from 0 degrees to 25 degrees C. In summer months, diurnal stream temperature variations were 30-40% of annual stream temperature variations, owing to reduced streamflows and increased atmospheric heating. Previous reports document that one Sierra stream site generally gains groundwater during low flows, while the second Sierra stream site may lose water during low flows. For August the diurnal streamflow variation was 11% at the gaining stream site and 30% at the losing stream site. On the basis of measured diurnal stream temperature variations, streambed infiltration rates were predicted to vary diurnally as much as 20% at the losing stream site. Analysis of results suggests that evapotranspiration losses determined diurnal streamflow variations in the gaining reaches, while in the losing reaches, evapotranspiration losses were compounded by diurnal variations in streambed infiltration. Diurnal variations in stream temperature were reduced in the gaining reaches as a result of discharging groundwater of relatively constant temperature. For the Sierra sites, comparison of results with those from a Small tributary demonstrated that stream temperature patterns were useful in delineating discharges of bank storage following dam releases. Direct coupling may have occurred between streamflow and stream temperature for losing stream reaches, such that reduced streamflows facilitated increased afternoon stream temperatures and increased afternoon stream temperatures induced increased streambed losses, leading to even greater increases in both stream temperature and streamflow losses.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000074461900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInteraction%2Bbetween%2Bstream%2Btemperature%252C%2Bstreamflow%252C%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2BAlpine%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJ%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DConstantz%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F98WR00998%26rft.epage%3D1615%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1609-1615%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1609%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D34&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/98WR00998,,"UPLAND STREAM,TIME-SERIES,INFILTRATION,CREEK",,"US Geol Survey, Div Water Resources, Branch Reg Res, 345 Middlefield Rd,MS-496, Menlo Park, CA 94025 USA"
36,36,"Guseva, S",Nov 2021 ,Variable Physical Drivers of Near-Surface Turbulence in a Regulated River,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Inland waters, such as lakes, reservoirs and rivers, are important sources of climate forcing trace gases. A key parameter that regulates the gas exchange between water and the atmosphere is the gas transfer velocity, which itself is controlled by near-surface turbulence in the water. While in lakes and reservoirs, near-surface turbulence is mainly driven by atmospheric forcing, in shallow rivers and streams it is generated by bottom friction of gravity-forced flow. Large rivers represent a transition between these two cases. Near-surface turbulence has rarely been measured in rivers and the drivers of turbulence have not been quantified. We analyzed continuous measurements of flow velocity and quantified turbulence as the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy over the ice-free season in a large regulated river in Northern Finland. Measured dissipation rates agreed with predictions from bulk parameters, including mean flow velocity, wind speed, surface heat flux, and with a one-dimensional numerical turbulence model. Values ranged from similar to 10-10m2s-3 to 10-5m2s-3. Atmospheric forcing or gravity was the dominant driver of near-surface turbulence for similar fraction of the time. Large variability in near-surface dissipation rate occurred at diel time scales, when the flow velocity was strongly affected by downstream dam operation. By combining scaling relations for boundary-layer turbulence at the river bed and at the air-water interface, we derived a simple model for estimating the relative contributions of wind speed and bottom friction of river flow as a function of depth.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000723106900008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR027939%26rft.atitle%3DVariable%2BPhysical%2BDrivers%2Bof%2BNear-Surface%2BTurbulence%2Bin%2Ba%2BRegulated%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DGuseva%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR027939%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DGuseva%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DAurela%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLorke%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR027939,"river,turbulence,gas exchange,wind","KINETIC-ENERGY DISSIPATION,CARBON-DIOXIDE,BOUNDARY-LAYER,METHANE EMISSIONS,REGIONAL-SCALE,LAKE VICTORIA,CO2 EVASION,STREAMS,OCEAN,VARIABILITY",,"Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Environm Sci, Landau, Germany"
37,37,"Simon, TN",Feb 2011 ,The contribution of man-made ditches to the regional stream biodiversity of the new river watershed in the Florida panhandle,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The role of ditches as reservoirs for or contributors to regional diversity has rarely been assessed. In this study, we aimed (1) to assess the effect of ditches on aquatic faunal assemblages of first order streams and (2) to assess the extent to which the animal communities in altered streams that are crossed by ditches resembled those found in nearby natural streams. We examined the fauna of four different aquatic habitats of the New River watershed in the Florida Panhandle: (1) natural streams, (2) altered streams, (3) ditches that cross the altered streams, and (4) ditches that do not cross the altered streams, sampling these habitats in three geographically distinct sites and visiting each location three times during a summer. Ditches did not have the same environmental features as streams and as a result their faunal community did not completely mimic those of natural streams. Streams contained 50% less aquatic vegetation and more canopy cover, while natural streams were more acidic than any other habitat. The connected altered stream and ditch habitats contained the highest biodiversity, while natural streams contained the lowest. Our ordination of taxonomic composition did not reveal any significant differences between habitats. However, natural streams were more likely to contain Hyalella spp., Oligochaetes, and Palaemonetes spp. than other sites, yet did not contain Baetidae spp., Naucorida spp., Trepobate spp., Dolomedes okefinokensis, Leptolucania ommata, or any Centrarcids. These results indicate the importance of ditches within this system as a reservoir for and contributor to regional stream biodiversity and this finding should be taken into consideration by managers for the conservation of the regional freshwater biodiversity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000285064900014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bcontribution%2Bof%2Bman-made%2Bditches%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bregional%2Bstream%2Bbiodiversity%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bnew%2Briver%2Bwatershed%2Bin%2Bthe%2BFlorida%2Bpanhandle%26rft.aufirst%3DTroy%2BN.%26rft.auinit%3DTN%26rft.aulast%3DSimon%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-010-0521-3%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D177%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D163-177%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D163%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D661%26rft.au%3DSimon%252C%2BTN%26rft.au%3DTravis%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-010-0521-3,"Biodiversity,Connectivity,Ditches,Macroinvertebrates,Streams,Wetlands","COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,GAMBUSIA-HOLBROOKI,PREDATION PRESSURE,HABITAT STRUCTURE,SPECIES RICHNESS,FISH ASSEMBLAGES,DIVERSITY,RESPONSES,INVERTEBRATES,MOSQUITOFISH",,"Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 1033 Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA"
38,38,"Xu, DH",Aug 2022 ,Development of Land-River Two-Way Hydrologic Coupling for Floodplain Inundation in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model,JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS,"Floodplain inundation links river and land systems through significant water, sediment, and nutrient exchanges. However, these two-way interactions between land and river are currently missing in most Earth System Models. In this study, we introduced the two-way hydrological coupling between the land component, E3SM Land Model, and the river component, Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport, in Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to study the impacts of floodplain inundation on land and river processes. We calibrated the river channel geometry and developed a new data-driven inundation scheme to improve the simulation of inundation dynamics in E3SM. The new inundation scheme captures 96% of the spatial variation of inundation area in a satellite inundation product at global scale, in contrast with 7% when the default inundation scheme of E3SM was used. Global simulations including the new inundation scheme performed at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees resolution with and without land-river two-way coupling was used to quantify the impact of coupling. Comparisons show that two-way coupling modifies the water and energy cycle in 20% of the global land cells. Specifically, riverine inundation is reduced by two-way coupling, but inland inundation is intensified. Wetter periods are more impacted by the two-way coupling at the global scale, while regions with different climates exhibit different sensitivities. The two-way exchange of water between the land and river components of E3SM provides the foundation for enabling two-way coupling of land-river sediment and biogeochemical fluxes. These capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the interactions between water and biogeochemical cycles and their response to human perturbations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000838664500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021MS002772%26rft.atitle%3DDevelopment%2Bof%2BLand-River%2BTwo-Way%2BHydrologic%2BCoupling%2Bfor%2BFloodplain%2BInundation%2Bin%2Bthe%2BEnergy%2BExascale%2BEarth%2BSystem%2BModel%26rft.aufirst%3DDonghui%26rft.auinit%3DDH%26rft.aulast%3DXu%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021MS002772%26rft.eissn%3D1942-2466%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BADVANCES%2BIN%2BMODELING%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BADV%2BMODEL%2BEARTH%2BSY%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BDH%26rft.au%3DBisht%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DPan%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ADVANCES+IN+MODELING+EARTH+SYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021MS002772,"floodplain inundation dynamics,Earth System Model,land-river interactions,surface-subsurface interactions,satellite data","SURFACE-WATER,DYNAMICS,EVAPOTRANSPIRATION,INTEGRATION,PERMAFROST,EXCHANGE,DATABASE,WETLANDS,IMPACT,WIDTH",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Atmospher Sci & Global Change Div, Richland, WA 99352 USA"

40,40,"Schaper, JL",Sep 1 2018 ,The fate of polar trace organic compounds in the hyporheic zone,WATER RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is often considered to efficiently remove polar trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from lotic systems, mitigating potential adverse effects of TrOCs on ecosystem functioning and drinking water production. Predicting the fate of TrOCs in the hyporheic zone (HZ) is difficult as the in-situ removal rate constants are not known and the biogeochemical factors as well as hydrological conditions controlling the removal efficiency are not fully understood. To determine the in-situ removal efficiency of the HZ for a variety of TrOCs as a function of the biogeochemical milieu, we conducted a field study in an urban river near Berlin, Germany. Subsurface flow was studied by time series of temperature depth profiles and the biogeochemical milieu of the HZ by concentration depth profiles. These results, in conjunction with a 1D advection-dispersion transport model, were used to calculate first-order removal rate constants of several polar TrOCs in the HZ. For the majority of TrOCs investigated, removal rate constants were strongly dependent on redox conditions, with significantly higher removal rates observed under predominantly suboxic (i.e. denitrifying) compared to anoxic (i.e. Fe and Mn reducing) conditions. Compared to previous studies on the fate of TrOCs in saturated sediments, half-lives within oxic/suboxic sections of the HZ were relatively low, attributable to the site-specific characteristics of the HZ in a stream dominated by wastewater treatment plant effluent. For nine out of thirteen investigated TrOCs, concentrations decreased significantly in the HZ with relative removal percentages ranging from 32% for primidone to 77% for gabapentin. For many TrOCs, removal efficiency decreased drastically as redox conditions became anoxic. For the majority of compounds investigated here, the HZ indeed acts as an efficient bioreactor that is capable of removing TrOCs along relatively short flow paths. Depending on the TrOC, removal capacity may be enhanced by either increasing the magnitude of groundwater-surface exchange fluxes, by increasing the total residence time in the HZ or the exposure time to suboxic zones, respectively.

41,41,"Segatto, PL",Jul 2020 ,Modeling the coupled dynamics of stream metabolism and microbial biomass,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Estimating and interpreting ecosystem metabolism remains an important challenge in stream ecology. Here, we propose a novel approach to model, estimate, and predict multiseasonal patterns of stream metabolism (gross primary production [GPP] and ecosystem respiration [ER]) at the reach scale leveraging on increasingly available long-term, high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO). The model uses DO measurements to estimate the parameters of a simple ecosystem model describing the underlying dynamics of stream autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial biomass. The model has been applied to four reaches within the Ybbs river network, Austria. Even if microbial biomasses are not observed, that is, they are treated as latent variables, results show that by accounting for the temporal dynamics of biomass, the model reproduces variability in metabolic fluxes that is not explained by fluctuations of light, temperature, and resources. The model is particularly data-demanding: to estimate the 11 parameters used in this formulation, it requires sufficiently long, for example, annual, time series, and significant scouring events. On the other hand, the approach has the potential to separate ER into its autotrophic and heterotrophic components, estimate a richer set of ecosystem carbon fluxes (i.e., carbon uptake, loss, and scouring), extrapolate metabolism estimates for periods when DO measurements are unavailable, and predict how ecosystem metabolism would respond to variations of the driving forces. The model is seen as a building block to develop tools to fully appreciate multiseasonal patterns of metabolic activity in river networks and to provide reliable estimations of carbon fluxes from land to ocean.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000547708600009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bthe%2Bcoupled%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bmetabolism%2Band%2Bmicrobial%2Bbiomass%26rft.aufirst%3DPier%2BLuigi%26rft.auinit%3DPL%26rft.aulast%3DSegatto%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Flno.11407%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D1593%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1573-1593%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1573%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D65%26rft.au%3DSegatto%252C%2BPL%26rft.au%3DBattin%252C%2BTJ%26rft.au%3DBertuzzo%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/lno.11407,,"ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,PERIPHYTON DYNAMICS,CARBON FLUXES,ALPINE STREAM,RIVER,RESPIRATION,OXYGEN,TEMPERATURE,GROWTH,PRODUCTIVITY",,"Univ Venice Ca Foscari, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Venice, Italy"

Real-time processing of data streams is arousing interest despite many challenges. Clustering is one of the most suitable methods for real-time data stream processing, because it can be applied with less prior information about the data and it does not need labeled instances. However, data stream clustering differs from traditional clustering in many aspects and it has several challenging issues. Here, we provide information regarding the concepts and common characteristics of data streams, such as concept drift, data structures for data streams, time window models and outlier detection.

43,43,"Loheide, SP",May 15 2006 ,Quantifying stream-aquifer interactions through the analysis of remotely sensed thermographic profiles and in situ temperature histories,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"The interaction between surface and subsurface waters through hyporheic exchange and baseflow is critical to maintaining ecological health in streams. During warm periods, groundwater-surface water interactions have two primary effects on stream temperature: (1) cool groundwater discharging as baseflow lowers stream temperature and (2) hyporheic exchange buffers diurnal stream temperature variations. We demonstrate, for the first time, how high-resolution, remotely sensed forward-looking infrared (FLIR) images and instream temperature data can be used to quantify detailed spatial patterns of groundwater discharge to a 1.7 km reach of Cottonwood Creek in Plumas National Forest, CA. We quantify the individual effects of baseflow and hyporheic exchange on stream temperatures by simulating the stream energy budget under different conceptual models of the stream-aquifer interaction. Observed spatial and temporal patterns of stream temperature are consistent with an increase in baseflow and hyporheic exchange within the middle, restored stream reach when compared to groundwater fluxes in the surrounding, unrestored reaches. One implication is that pond and plug stream restoration may improve the aquatic habitat by depressing maximum stream temperatures by > 3 C ( K).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000237525500036,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bstream-aquifer%2Binteractions%2Bthrough%2Bthe%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Bremotely%2Bsensed%2Bthermographic%2Bprofiles%2Band%2Bin%2Bsitu%2Btemperature%2Bhistories%26rft.aufirst%3DSteven%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DSP%26rft.aulast%3DLoheide%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes0522074%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D3341%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3336-3341%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3336%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DLoheide%252C%2BSP%26rft.au%3DGorelick%252C%2BSM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es0522074,,"NORTHEASTERN OREGON,WATER TEMPERATURE,GROUND-WATER,RIVERS,PERSPECTIVE",,"Stanford Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA"
44,44,"Mcdowell, RW",Aug 2020 ,Likely controls on dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations in baseflow of an agricultural stream,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"Purpose High baseflow phosphorus (P) concentrations increase the likelihood of periphyton blooms. Several physical and chemical factors can control baseflow P concentrations such as hydraulic exchange with groundwater, particle size-sorting, redox chemistry and different sediment sources. We hypothesized that of these sources, anoxic sediments would allow P-rich groundwater to influence baseflow P concentrations the most and that the measurement of the equilibrium P concentration (EPC0) of sediments under oxic conditions would not predict P release in anaerobic sediment or baseflow P concentrations. Materials and methods At four locations along an agricultural stream, we measured dissolved reactive P (DRP), pH, iron, manganese, sulphate, nitrate and dissolved oxygen in streamflow and hyporheic water at 0-200, 200-400 and 400-800 mm depths and P fractions and EPC0 in sediment samples from the 0-200, 200-400 and 400-800 mm depths. Results and discussion Concentrations of DRP in streamflow and shallow hyporheic zone water increased downstream and were mirrored by concentrations in shallow sediment, EPC0 measurements of oxic sediments and deeper hyporheic waters. Groundwater samples and the EPC0 in deeper sediments did not show a pattern or residence time consistent with the supply of P to baseflow despite deeper sediment being anoxic and less likely to sorb upwelling P. There was also no change in pH or particle size downstream ruling out the degassing of groundwater or sediment size-sorting as an influence. However, the composition of sediment and underlying lithology of the catchment pointed to sediment downstream that was different to upstream sediment in that it could store and release more P. Conclusions Given the strong influence of sediment source on baseflow P concentrations, efforts to decrease the likelihood of periphyton blooms under baseflow should focus on reducing the erosion of P-rich sediment. Furthermore, the presence of oxic conditions in surface sediment meant that there was a relationship between EPC0 and hyporheic water P concentrations. However, mixed oxic/anoxic conditions in deeper layer may require EPC0, or release rates, to be measured under reducing conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000530828900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLikely%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bdissolved%2Breactive%2Bphosphorus%2Bconcentrations%2Bin%2Bbaseflow%2Bof%2Ban%2Bagricultural%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DRichard%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DRW%26rft.aulast%3DMcdowell%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11368-020-02644-w%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7480%26rft.epage%3D3265%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1439-0108%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BSOILS%2BAND%2BSEDIMENTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3254-3265%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3254%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BSOIL%2BSEDIMENT%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DMcdowell%252C%2BRW%26rft.au%3DDepree%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DStenger%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+SOILS+AND+SEDIMENTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11368-020-02644-w,"Anaerobic,Hyporheic zone,Groundwater,Lithology,Runoff,Sediment,water interactions","WATER-QUALITY,SEDIMENT,SOIL,RELEASE,SURFACE,MOBILIZATION,MANAGEMENT,CHEMISTRY,SORPTION,SIZE",,"Lincoln Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, POB 84, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand"
45,45,"Nelson, AR",Nov 2019 ,"Heterogeneity in Hyporheic Flow, Pore Water Chemistry, and Microbial Community Composition in an Alpine Streambed",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"The hyporheic zone, where surface water and groundwater mix, is an important microbial habitat where biogeochemical reactions influence water quality. We show that spatial variability in hyporheic flow in the East River near Crested Butte, CO, drives heterogeneity in streambed geochemical conditions and microbial community assemblages, but the diversity of microbial assemblages remains nearly constant throughout the reach. In July 2018, we collected approximately 100 pore water samples at 20-cm depth and analyzed them for anions, cations, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, and basic water quality parameters. Vertical hydraulic head gradients were also measured to assess the potential for upward or downward flow, and heat tracing was used to quantify vertical flux rates at a subset of locations. We found that regions of the streambed that are more groundwater-dominated contain less dissolved oxygen, higher concentrations of reduced metals, and more microbially processed, recalcitrant DOM, while more surface water-dominated locations contain higher dissolved oxygen concentrations and terrestrially derived, labile DOM. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of extracted DNA revealed that microbial community composition varies with geochemical gradients related to hyporheic flow. These findings provide a better understanding of hyporheic controls on streambed biogeochemistry during the baseflow season, which is expected to lengthen with climate change in alpine watersheds due to earlier snowmelt onset and reduced snowpack.Plain Language Summary Groundwater and surface water mixing in streambeds (hyporheic exchange) is important for nutrient and carbon cycling and influences the overall quality of surface water. In this study, we aimed to map relationships between hyporheic exchange, pore water chemistry, and microbial communities in the streambed of an alpine river during low flow conditions. We found that regions of the streambed with greater surface water influence had larger concentrations of dissolved oxygen and microbially available carbon compounds. The composition of streambed microbial communities also shifted with changes in pore water chemistry, though communities were all similarly diverse. As climate change progresses, earlier snowmelt onset and reduced snowpack should alter flow and biogeochemical processes in streambeds. This study provides a baseline for exploring future changes in alpine streambeds.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000505298700015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHeterogeneity%2Bin%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%252C%2BPore%2BWater%2BChemistry%252C%2Band%2BMicrobial%2BCommunity%2BComposition%2Bin%2Ban%2BAlpine%2BStreambed%26rft.aufirst%3DAmelia%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DAR%26rft.aulast%3DNelson%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019JG005226%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D3478%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3465-3478%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3465%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D124%26rft.au%3DNelson%252C%2BAR%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DWilkins%252C%2BMJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019JG005226,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER,RIVER,ZONE,EXCHANGE,INTERFACE,RATES,DENITRIFICATION,TEMPERATURE,3RD-ORDER,INDICATOR",,"Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA"

In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, many glacial meltwater streams flow for only 5-12 weeks a year and yet support extensive benthic microbial communities. We investigated NO3- uptake and denitrification in Green Creek by analyzing small-scale microbial mat dynamics in mesocosms and reach-scale nutrient cycling in two whole-stream NO3- enrichment experiments. Nitrate uptake results indicated that microbial mats were nitrogen (N)-limited, with NO3- uptake rates as high as 16 nmol N cm(-2) h(-1). Denitrification potentials associated with microbial mats were also as high as 16 nmol N cm(-2) h(-1). During two whole-stream NO3--enrichment experiments, a simultaneous pulse of NO2- was observed in the stream water. The one-dimensional solute transport model with inflow and storage was modified to simulate two storage zones: one to account for short time scale hydrologic exchange of stream water into and out of the benthic microbial mat, the other to account for longer time scale hydrologic exchange with the hyporheic zone. Simulations indicate that injected NO3- was removed both in the microbial mat and in the hyporheic zone and that as much as 20% of the NO3- that entered the microbial mat and hyporheic zone was transformed to NO2- by dissimilatory reduction. Because of the rapid hydrologic exchange in microbial mats, it is likely that denitrification is limited either by biotic assimilation, reductase limitation, or transport limitation (reduced NO2- is transported away from reducing microbes).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000224979900039,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDenitrification%2Band%2Bhydrologic%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bin%2Ba%2Bglacial%2Bmeltwater%2Bstream%252C%2BMcMurdo%2BDry%2BValleys%252C%2BAntarctica%26rft.aufirst%3DMN%26rft.auinit%3DMN%26rft.aulast%3DGooseff%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.2004.49.5.1884%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D1895%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1884-1895%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1884%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DDuff%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.2004.49.5.1884,,"NUTRIENT-PERIPHYTON DYNAMICS,HYPORHEIC ZONE,WATER VELOCITY,SCALE PATTERNS,NITRATE,TRANSPORT,SEDIMENTS,EXCHANGE,RIVER,NITRIFICATION",,"Utah State Univ, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA"

Stream-water samples were collected upstream and downstream of the braided section at fortnightly intervals throughout the 2001-2002 hydrological year and subsequently at finer resolution over two rainfall events. The braided reach was found to exert a significant downstream buffering effect on the alkalinity of these waters, particularly at moderate flows (4-8 m(3) s(-1)/congruent toQ(30-70)). Extensive hydrochemical surveys were undertaken to characterize the different source waters feeding the braids. Shallow groundwater flow systems at the edge of the braided floodplain, recharged by effluent streams and hillslope drainage, appeared to be of particular significance. Deeper groundwater was identified closer to the main channel, upwelling through the hyporheic zone. Both sources contributed to the significant groundwater-surface-water interactions that promote the buffering effect observed through the braided reach.

48,48,"Akbari-Moghanjoughi, M",Mar 2017 ,Mode Coupling and Two-Stream Instabilities in Semiconductors,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE,"The quantum hydrodynamic model is used to investigate the arbitrary degenerate electron/hole stream instabilities in ballistic semiconductors or semiconductor plasmas (semiplasmas) for a wide range of impurity doping, number density, and temperatures. It is observed that, while the instability in classical plasma regime is always of single k-range type, the double-range instability can occur in degenerate plasma regime. Different types of carrier counter-streaming instabilities are classified and parametrically studied in arbitrarily doped ballistic semiconductors. The parametric study of counter-stream instability in silicon at room temperature shows that the doping scheme has fundamental effect on electron-electron and hole-hole instabilities but no effect on electron-hole instability. Other parameters, such as the electron temperature and stream speed, have significant effects on the unstable wavenumber range and the growth rate. It is remarked that the electron stream in n-type semiconductors becomes unstable at somewhat lower limit of the stream speed than that of holes in a p-type silicon semiconductors. A description based on the energy exchange between unstable modes is given for different instability types. It is found that the instability in asymmetric doped semiconductors (electron-electron and hole-hole) is of symmetric type without energy exchange between the modes, while, for symmetric doped semiconductors (electron-hole), it is of asymmetric type with the energy exchange. Finally, it is found that the electron and hole spin exchange-correlation effects enhance the two-stream instability.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000395744900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMode%2BCoupling%2Band%2BTwo-Stream%2BInstabilities%2Bin%2BSemiconductors%26rft.aufirst%3DMassoud%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DAkbari-Moghanjoughi%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTPS.2016.2642120%26rft.eissn%3D1939-9375%26rft.epage%3D184%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0093-3813%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BPLASMA%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D174-184%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D174%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BPLASMA%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D45&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+PLASMA+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/TPS.2016.2642120,"Plasmas,plasma applications,plasmons,plasma stability","2 STREAM INSTABILITY,QUANTUM PLASMAS,MAGNETIZED PLASMA,ENERGY,SATURATION,SIMULATION,TURBULENCE,PHYSICS,WAVES,ION",,"Azarbaijan Shahid Madani Univ, Dept Phys, Fac Sci, Tabriz 51745406, Iran"
49,49,"Zheng, LZ",Apr 2016 ,Temperature effects on nitrogen cycling and nitrate removal-production efficiency in bed form-induced hyporheic zones,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Hyporheic flow in aquatic sediment controls solute and heat transport thereby mediating the fate of nutrients and contaminants, dissolved oxygen, and temperature in the hyporheic zone ( HZ). We conducted a series of numerical simulations of hyporheic processes within a dune with different uniform temperatures, coupling turbulent open channel fluid flow, porous fluid flow, and reactive solute transport to study the temperature dependence of nitrogen source/sink functionality and its efficiency. Two cases were considered: a polluted stream and a pristine stream. Sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the influence of stream water [NO3-]/[NH4+]. The simulations showed that in both cases warmer temperatures resulted in shallower denitrification zones and oxic-anoxic zone boundaries, but the trend of net denitrification rate and nitrate removal or production efficiency of the HZ for these two cases differed. For both cases, at high [NO3-]/[NH4+], the HZ functioned as a NO3- sink with the nitrate removal efficiency increasing with temperature. But at low [NO3-]/[NH4+] for the polluted stream, the HZ is a NO3- sink at low temperature but then switches to a NO3- source at warmer temperatures. For the pristine stream case, the HZ was always a NO3- source, with the NO3- production efficiency increasing monotonically with temperature. In addition, although the interfacial fluid flux expectedly increased with increasing temperature due to decreasing fluid viscosity, the total nitrate flux into the HZ did not follow this trend. This is because when HZ nitrification is high, uniformly elevated [NO3-] lowers dispersive fluxes into the HZ. We found that there are numerous confounding and interacting factors that combined to lead to the final temperature dependence of N transformation reaction rates. Although the temperature effect on the rate constant can be considered as the dominant factor, simply using the Arrhenius equation to predict the reaction rate would lead to incomplete insight by ignoring the changes in interfacial fluid and solute fluxes and reaction zone areas. Our study shows that HZ temperature and stream [NO3-]/[NH4+] are key controls for HZ sink/source functions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000378702800004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTemperature%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bnitrogen%2Bcycling%2Band%2Bnitrate%2Bremoval-production%2Befficiency%2Bin%2Bbed%2Bform-induced%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%26rft.aufirst%3DLizhi%26rft.auinit%3DLZ%26rft.aulast%3DZheng%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015JG003162%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D1103%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1086-1103%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1086%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D121%26rft.au%3DZheng%252C%2BLZ%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BLC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39kMyk3JEcbAoWQBnnFfb&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015JG003162,,"MISSISSIPPI RIVER NETWORK,HEADWATER STREAMS,HEAT-TRANSPORT,DENITRIFICATION,EXCHANGE,ECOSYSTEMS,SEDIMENTS,BEDFORMS,DYNAMICS,FLOW",,"Univ Texas Austin, Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA"
