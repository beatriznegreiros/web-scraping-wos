The identification of their life stages allowed considerations regarding their presence in the hyporheos, mainly used as a refuge habitat, particularly during vulnerable phases of their life cycle (neanid stage and pre-imaginal phase). This function is possible, given the more stable environmental conditions and the minor predatory pressures in this habitat. The gut content analyses of the three species assigned them to the engulfers-carnivorous functional feeding group, with slight resource partitions between the two largest species. P intricatus appears to feed on less mobile and fleshy preys while D. fontium prefers more sclerotized and active preys. The results indicate that the hyporheos acts not only as a refuge area but also as a trophic habitat for some Perlodidae species.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000262081300006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFeeding%2Bhabits%2Bof%2BPerlodidae%2B%2528Plecoptera%2529%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bhabitats%2Bof%2BAlpine%2Bstreams%2B%2528Trentino-NE%2BItaly%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DLuana%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DSilveri%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.33338%252Fef.84433%26rft.epage%3D183%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0785-8760%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENTOMOLOGICA%2BFENNICA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D176-183%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D176%26rft.stitle%3DENTOMOL%2BFENNICA%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DSilveri%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3Dde%2BFigueroa%252C%2BJMT%26rft.au%3DMaiolini%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=ENTOMOLOGICA+FENNICA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Brosten, TR",Oct-dec 2006 ,Profiles of temporal thaw depths beneath two arctic stream types using ground-penetrating radar,PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES,"Thaw depths beneath arctic streams may have significant impact on the seasonal development of hyporheic zone hydraulics. To investigate thaw progression over the 2004 summer season we acquired a series of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles at five sites from May-September, using 100, 200 and 400 MHz antennas. We selected sites with the objective of including stream reaches that span a range of geomorphologic conditions on Alaska's North Slope. Thaw depths interpreted from GPR data were constrained by both recorded subsurface temperature profiles and by pressing a metal probe through the active layer to the point of refusal. We found that low-energy stream environments react much more slowly to seasonal solar input and maintain thaw thicknesses longer throughout the late season whereas thaw depths increase rapidly within high-energy streams at the beginning of the season and decrease over the late season period.

2,"Rosenberry, DO",Jul 15 2009 ,Effects of sediment transport and seepage direction on hydraulic properties at the sediment-water interface of hyporheic settings,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Relations between seepage flux and hydraulic properties are difficult to quantify in fluvial settings because of the difficulty in measuring these variables in situ. Tests conducted in a 1.5-m diameter by 1.5-m tall sediment-filled tank indicate that hydraulic gradient increased and hydraulic conductivity (K) decreased following the onset of downward seepage but both parameters were little changed following the onset of upward seepage. Reductions in K during downward seepage were more pronounced when surface-water current was sufficient to mobilize sediment on the bed. Averaged ratios of K determined during upward seepage to K determined during downward seepage (K-up/K-down) through a sand-and-gravel bed increased from 1.4 to 1.7 with increasing surface-water velocity, and decreased to slightly greater than I when the sediment bed became fully mobile. K-up/K-down for tests conducted with a silt veneer on the bed surface was greater than 2 for all but the fastest surface-water velocities. Substantial reductions in K also were associated with a silt floc that formed on the bed surface during and following test runs. Although the silt floc was typically less than 0.5 mm in thickness, most of the hydraulic gradient was distributed across this thin layer. K of the thin silt floc was reduced by two to three orders of magnitude relative to the underlying sediment. Directional bias in K and relation between K and surface-water velocity require the presence or absence of a layer of lower-K sediment at or near the bed surface, without which no reduction in K and corresponding increase in hydraulic gradient can occur at the bed surface. The lack of prior observation of the consistent bias in K associated with seepage direction is somewhat surprising given the numerous studies where K has been measured in fluvial settings, but may be explained by the small value of the bias relative to the typical uncertainty associated with field determinations of K. If shown to exist in field settings. this bias and its relation to fluvial processes will be relevant to many studies conducted in hyporheic settings that require determination of fluxes across the sediment-water interface.

3,"Piper, LR",Jan 2017 ,Colimitation and the coupling of N and P uptake kinetics in oligotrophic mountain streams,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Ecosystem element cycles can be tightly linked by both abiotic and biotic processes. Evidence for multi-element limitation (i.e., colimitation) of a variety of ecosystem processes is growing rapidly, yet our ability to quantify patterns of coupled nutrient dynamics at the ecosystem level has been hindered by logistical and methodological constraints. Here we quantify coupled nitrogen and phosphorus uptake kinetics in three oligotrophic mountain streams by using novel experimental techniques that quantify colimitation dynamics across a range of nutrient concentrations and stoichiometries. We show that relative demand for NO3-N and PO4-P varied across streams, but that short term availability of one nutrient consistently resulted in elevated, but variable, uptake of the other nutrient at all sites. We used temporally offset, pulsed nutrient additions to parameterize dual-nutrient Michaelis-Menten uptake surface models that represent NO3-N and PO4-P uptake at any given concentration or dissolved NO3-N:PO4-P stoichiometry. Our results indicated that the uptake of N and P were strongly enhanced in the presence of the other nutrient. Surface models quantitatively reflect patterns of colimitation and multi-element demand in streams, and should allow for parameterization of more realistic stream network models that explicitly account for interactions among element cycles.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394351700010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DColimitation%2Band%2Bthe%2Bcoupling%2Bof%2BN%2Band%2BP%2Buptake%2Bkinetics%2Bin%2Boligotrophic%2Bmountain%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DLeslie%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DLR%26rft.aulast%3DPiper%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-017-0294-0%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D184%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D165-184%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D165%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D132%26rft.au%3DPiper%252C%2BLR%26rft.au%3DCross%252C%2BWF%26rft.au%3DMcGlynn%252C%2BBL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

5,"Zhao, YP",Jan 2023 ,Streaming Potential in Gas Phase Discrete Unsaturated Pore,ELECTRONICS,"The seismoelectric effect of porous media is the main basis for seismoelectric logging. At present, most of the studies on the seismoelectric effect in unsaturated porous media adopt the model of pores with continuous distribution of gas and liquid. There is a lack of theoretical research on the micro mechanism of the seismoelectric effect of unsaturated porous media with discrete gas phase, and the existing studies do not consider the effect of the electric double layer at the gas-liquid interface on the seismoelectric effect. Based on the capillary model, this work adopted the gas phase discrete model, combined the electric double layer theory and the seepage principle, considered the effect of electric double layer at the pore wall and the gas-liquid interface, and studied the micro principle of the seismoelectric effect of unsaturated porous media. Firstly, we studied the variation of gas-water two-phase flow pattern with saturation in unsaturated pores, then proposed the equivalent principle of series circuits, deduced the effective streaming current and conductance of a pore containing multiple bubbles, and then deduced the streaming potential coupling coefficient in the unsaturated pores. We also studied the effect of pore parameters such as saturation, pore size, bubble spacing, pore fluid viscosity, and salinity on the streaming potential coupling coefficient. The results show that the streaming potential coupling coefficient first increases and then decreases with the decrease in saturation, which is the same as the trend measured in Allegre's experiment, and provide a theoretical explanation for the non-monotonic change in the coupling coefficient with saturation in unsaturated porous media.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000908955400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B72%26rft.atitle%3DStreaming%2BPotential%2Bin%2BGas%2BPhase%2BDiscrete%2BUnsaturated%2BPore%26rft.aufirst%3DYongpeng%26rft.auinit%3DYP%26rft.aulast%3DZhao%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Felectronics12010072%26rft.eissn%3D2079-9292%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DELECTRONICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DELECTRONICS-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BYP%26rft.au%3DSun%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DNie%252C%2BZP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=ELECTRONICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
6,"Cerepi, A",Jul 2017 ,Streaming potential coupling coefficient in unsaturated carbonate rocks,GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL,"The seismoelectric and self-potential methods are showing promises to characterize both the vadose zone of the Earth, hydrocarbon reservoirs and CO2 sequestration. That said, the dependence of a key parameter, the streaming coupling coefficient, with the saturation remains highly debated. We explore here the relationship between the streaming potential coupling coefficient, the electrical resistivity, the capillary pressure curves and the permeability in two saturated and partially saturated carbonate rocks characterized by distinct textures. We investigate a limestone from the Paris basin (the Brauvilliers limestone) and a dolostone from the Aquitain basin (sample labeled LS2), both in France. The two core samples are characterized in terms of their porosity and intrinsic formation factor. A new core flooding system is used to measure simultaneously and, for the first time, both the relative permeability, the resistivity index and the streaming potential coupling coefficient in steady-state two-phase flow conditions as a function of the saturation with CO2 or N-2. The results are compared with a recently developed theoretical model, which can accommodate either the Brooks and Corey model or the van Genuchten model for the capillary pressure curves. This model is predicting a set of relationships between the streaming potential coupling coefficient, the relative permeability and the second Archie's exponent. We found a good agreement between the model based on the van Genuchten approach and experimental data, but still we could not fit all the curves with the same value of the pore size index. or van Genuchten exponent mv especially for the relative permeability.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000409281300021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStreaming%2Bpotential%2Bcoupling%2Bcoefficient%2Bin%2Bunsaturated%2Bcarbonate%2Brocks%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DCerepi%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1093%252Fgji%252Fggx162%26rft.eissn%3D1365-246X%26rft.epage%3D302%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0956-540X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BJOURNAL%2BINTERNATIONAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D291-302%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D291%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BJ%2BINT%26rft.volume%3D210%26rft.au%3DCerepi%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DCherubini%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DRevil%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+JOURNAL+INTERNATIONAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Groundwater-stream water exchange fluxes were estimated on the basis of Rn-222 mass balance approaches under losing and gaining stream conditions, and groundwater inflow type was identified using a spatial survey of Rn-220 in stream water.New hydrological insights for the region: The Rn-222 activities at 20 stations along the stream during four sampling campaigns were higher at high altitudes than low altitudes, regardless of the season. At two sections, which appeared to be gaining systems, the groundwater inflow rates were estimated to be 6.5 x 10(2) and 4.0 x 10(2) m(3) d(-1). At another stream section, where groundwater inflow to the stream and stream water leakage into groundwater may alternatingly occur, the groundwater inflow and stream water leakage were 1.5 x 10(2) and 2.5 x 10(4) m(3) d(-1), respectively.

8,"Wondzell, SM",Mar 2015 ,Groundwater-surface-water interactions: perspectives on the development of the science over the last 20 years,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Freshwater Science published a special series of papers on groundwater-surface-water (GW-SW) interactions in this issue (2015), marking the anniversary of an earlier special series of papers on the hyporheic zone published in 1993. In this concluding paper, I compare the 2 special series of papers and use this comparison to examine the development of the science in the years between 1993 and 2015. The 1993 papers marked the beginning of a period of exponential growth in the study of, and publication of, papers on GW-SW interactions. The 1993 papers tended to be forward looking, proposing conceptual models of GW-SW interactions across stream networks and identifying critical gaps. The 2015 special series of papers contrasts sharply with that of 1993. Broad issue papers are mostly lacking from the current special series. Instead, the special series is dominated by papers focusing on process-based or descriptive studies using empirical approaches. This difference probably stems from major methodological advancements over the past 2 decades that make it possible to study GW-SW interactions with ever greater detail and, thus, allows more complete understanding of specific processes. In contrast, the authors of the 1993 special series were acutely aware of the paucity of GW-SW studies and, thus, posed their conceptual models as hypotheses. Surprisingly, these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested in the decades since their publication. Perhaps it is time to re-examine such broad conceptual models. There remains a critical need for a holistic understanding of how GW-SW interactions vary among streams types and sizes and with changes in discharge among seasons or over storm events and how these GW-SW interactions influence stream ecosystem processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000349995000028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater-surface-water%2Binteractions%253A%2Bperspectives%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bdevelopment%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bscience%2Bover%2Bthe%2Blast%2B20%2Byears%26rft.aufirst%3DSteven%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DWondzell%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F679665%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D376%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D368-376%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D368%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
9,"Hartman, MD",Jan 24 2007 ,"Application of a coupled ecosystem-chemical equilibrium model, DayCent-Chem, to stream and soil chemistry in a Rocky Mountain watershed",ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen species have the potential to acidify terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but nitrate and ammonium are also critical nutrients for plant and microbial productivity. Both the ecological response and the hydrochemical response to atmospheric deposition are of interest to regulatory and land management agencies. We developed a non-spatial biogeochemical model to simulate soil and surface water chemistry by linking the daily version of the CENTURY ecosystem model (DayCent) with a low temperature aqueous geochemical model, PHREEQC. The coupled model, DayCent-Chem, simulates the daily dynamics of plant production, soil organic matter, cation exchange, mineral weathering, elution, stream discharge, and solute concentrations in soil water and stream flow. By aerially weighting the contributions of separate bedrock/talus and tundra simulations, the model was able to replicate the measured seasonal and annual stream chemistry for most solutes for Andrews Creek in Loch Vale watershed, Rocky Mountain National Park. Simulated soil chemistry, net primary production, live biomass, and soil organic matter for forest and tundra matched well with measurements. This model is appropriate for accurately describing ecosystem and surface water chemical response to atmospheric deposition and climate change. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

10,"Arango, CP",Mar 2008 ,Land use influences the spatiotemporal controls on nitrification and denitrification in headwater streams,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"N and C cycles in headwater streams are coupled, and land use can modify these cycles by increasing N availability and removing riparian vegetation. To increase our understanding of how land use modifies the controls on N cycling, we quantified rates of 2 microbial N transformations in a total of 18 agricultural and urban streams (with and without riparian buffers) for 3 y to examine how riparian vegetation and land use influence sediment nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification rates were highest in agricultural streams in late spring. Nitrification was not related to streamwater NH4+ concentrations but was positively related to sediment C content (linear regression, r(2) = 0.72, p < 0.001). This result suggests that benthic decomposition provided NH4+ (via mineralization) to increase sediment nitrification. Denitrification rates did not differ among landuse types but were positively related to sediment C content and streamwater NO3- concentration (multiple linear regression, R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). Sediment C content, the primary predictor of denitrification rates, did not differ among land uses, but strearnwater NO3- concentration, the secondary predictor of denitrification rates, was highest in winter and in agricultural streams, indicating that land use and season were more important determinants of denitrification than coupled nitrification. Substrate availability (N and Q for N transformations generally did not differ between buffered and unbuffered streams within a similar landuse type, probably because of the confounding influence of tile drainage systems, which effectively decouple stream channels from their riparian zones. Land use influenced the delivery of the necessary substrates for N transformations but decreased the role of riparian zones in stream N cycling by simplifying the drainage network of headwater streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000253203100008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLand%2Buse%2Binfluences%2Bthe%2Bspatiotemporal%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bnitrification%2Band%2Bdenitrification%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DCP%26rft.aulast%3DArango%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F07-024.1%26rft.epage%3D107%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D90-107%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D90%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DArango%252C%2BCP%26rft.au%3DTank%252C%2BJL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The results showed that calculation errors of NH4+-N and DO for the model were in the ranges of -15%-13% and -18%-16%, respectively. Despite of the deviations between the monitoring data and simulation result, the calculation accuracy of the model conforms to the practical engineering requirement.

12,"Gomez, JD",Sep 20 2012 ,Residence time distributions in sinuosity-driven hyporheic zones and their biogeochemical effects,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange plays a key role in the biogeochemical evolution of water and in ecosystem functioning at the local, reach, and watershed scales. Residence time is a fundamental metric to describe the possible transformation taking place in this exchange zone. With this in mind, we use a simple conceptual model to explore the residence time distributions (RTDs) of sinuosity-driven hyporheic zones (HZs) and to discriminate the individual effect of sinuosity (sigma), valley slope (J(x)), hydraulic conductivity (K), aquifer dispersivity (alpha(L)), and the biogeochemical timescales ( BTSs) that characterize the degradation of dissolved organic carbon in these hydrologic systems. We find that RTDs are characterized by one early mode and a late time power law behavior. For a given aquifer dispersivity, the shape of these distributions is stretched or compressed by changes in J(x), K, and sigma, having a strong influence on the net biogeochemical transformations within the HZ. Using BTSs proposed in previous studies and sensitivity analyses, we show the potential of sigma, J(x), and K to classify meander HZs as net sinks of nitrates or only modulators of the residence times in the subsurface where nitrate reduction is negligible. These findings can be used as predictive tools to quantify the potential of meanders as biogeochemical reactors at the watershed scale with the aid of remote sensing data and GIS processing techniques. These tools can guide experimental design, suggesting important locations to visit, sample, and/or instrument. Also, hyporheic restoration projects can use them for initial site selection and design of channel modifications.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309137400005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW09533%26rft.atitle%3DResidence%2Btime%2Bdistributions%2Bin%2Bsinuosity-driven%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%2Band%2Btheir%2Bbiogeochemical%2Beffects%26rft.aufirst%3DJesus%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DGomez%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2012WR012180%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DGomez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DWilson%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"Sauvage, S",Aug 1 2018 ,Modelling the role of riverbed compartments in the regulation of water quality as an ecological service,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Water quality is strongly related to a river's ecosystem composition at landscape scale. Key water/sediment interfaces, referred to here as functional compartments (FCs), are the epilithic biofilm, the fine sediment at the bottom of the river and the macroporous medium or hyporheic zone, which is primarily located in the active channel where subsurface flow occurs. The function of each FC (consumption or production of organic matter and nitrate) at river reach scale was examined through modelling and calibrated within field measurements to quantify the regulation service for water quality improvement. These functions were tested on a river reach of a dominant interface function (DIF) river, the Garonne River in south-west France. It was found that: a) functions differed between the FCs as a result of biotic (organisms involved) and abiotic (hydrological and morphological) conditions, b) functions varied within each FC over time (measured, but not discussed) and c) FCs acted as transient storage zones and contributed to the development of the river's self-purification capacity. It was concluded that in relation to the concept of river continuum, the upper reaches in the catchment were dominated by epilithic biofilm, where the main function was the production of organic matter (OM) (mean of 0.3 g.m(-2).d(-1), range from 0.08 to -1.7), the middle course was dominated by the hyporheic zone, where the most important function was to serve as a nitrate sink (-1.25 g.m(-2).d(-1), range from -45.6 to -0.19), and the downstream parts of the river, whose main function was the degradation of OM within the fine sediment FC (mean of - 1000 g.m(-2).d(-1), range from - 960 to - 1440). Hence, the morphological heterogeneity of rivers that mimic the natural mosaic of functional compartments with exchanges of water, organic matter and nutrients between compartments could contribute to enhancing their self-purification function and thus to improving water quality and system health. This study is a first step in testing the influence of the different FCs on the water quality regulation service provided by a river reach. The final objective was to be able to upscale the modelling of the different interfaces involved in a watershed's water quality regulation service. The present study demonstrates the need to take the biophysical diversity of reaches into account in order to accurately model this regulation service. Thus the BIODIF concept of BIO-physical (biological and physical) Diversity for rivers Dominated by river-bed Interface Functions (DIF rivers) was investigated for its ability to identify the theoretical relationships between the structure and the function of regulation of a river.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000432518800003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModelling%2Bthe%2Brole%2Bof%2Briverbed%2Bcompartments%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bregulation%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bquality%2Bas%2Ban%2Becological%2Bservice%26rft.aufirst%3DSabine%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DSauvage%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecoleng.2018.02.018%26rft.eissn%3D1872-6992%26rft.epage%3D30%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0925-8574%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D19-30%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D19%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D118%26rft.au%3DSauvage%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DSanchez-Perez%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DGerino%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

In this study, we explored denitrification in a riparian zone at the land-water interface in a hydropower reservoir of the upper Mekong River. Results demonstrated that hydropower production intensified water level fluctuations in the reservoir and significantly accelerated riparian denitrification process at the land-water interface; the denitrification rate exhibited a strong positive relationship with the period of water level rising-falling cycle (r(2) = 0.98, P < 0.05). Intensified water level fluctuations created frequently alternate wetting-drying cycles and enhanced hyporheic exchanges in the riparian zone, which accelerated organic carbon mineralization and thereby increased carbon source supply to fuel denitrification. In addition, river impoundment after dam construction appreciably enlarged the hot spots for riparian denitrification. The accelerated denitrification as well as the enlarged hot spots area jointly enhanced nitrogen removal from impounded rivers.

15,"Pessoa-Lopes, M",Jun 22 2016 ,Arsenate removal from sulphate-containing water streams by an ion-exchange membrane process,SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY,"A possible limitation of applying Donnan dialysis for arsenate removal from drinking water supplies is when sulphate is present as an accompanying anion in the water to be treated, due to strong competition between arsenate and sulphate transport through standard grade anion-exchange membranes. This work aims at evaluating the feasibility of employing an ion-exchange membrane Donnan dialysis based process with a new strategy of using sulphate as the driving counter-ion for arsenate counter-transport and removal from sulphate-containing drinking water streams. The process performance with different arsenate receiving solutions (containing chloride or sulphate as driving counter-ions and with or without arsenic precipitation) was investigated and compared. Experiments were carried out to separate arsenate from contaminated water comparing the performance of three anion-exchange membranes: one with mono-valent anion permselective properties and two standard grade membranes. As selection criteria, the transport rate of arsenate and its membrane retention were investigated. The effects of pH variation and co-ion (cation) leakage on the Donnan dialysis process efficiency were also studied. Efficient arsenic removal was achieved through integrating Donnan dialytic transport of arsenate with its simultaneous precipitation in the receiving compartment with FeSO4. The process proposed is environmentally friendly and with minimal maintenance requirements, which makes it especially attractive to be applied in rural areas located far from centralized drinking water supply infrastructures.

16,"Tockner, K",May 1999 ,"Hydrological connectivity, and the exchange of organic matter and nutrients in a dynamic river-floodplain system (Danube, Austria)",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The relationship between hydrological connectivity, and the exchange processes of suspended sediments, organic matter and nutrients (NO3-N) was investigated in a dynamically connected river-floodplain segment of the Danube over a 15-month period in 1995 and 1996 in the Alluvial Zone National Park, Austria.2. Based on water level dynamics and water retention times, three phases of river-floodplain connectivity were identified: disconnection (phase I), seepage inflow (phase II) and upstream surface connection (phase III). The frequency of occurrence of these phases was 67.5%, 29.3% and 3.2%, respectively, during the study period.3. A conceptual model is presented linking hydrological connectivity with ecological processes. Generally, the floodplain shifts from a closed and mainly biologically controlled ecosystem during phase I to an increasingly open and more hydrologically controlled system during phases II and III. Phase I, with internal processes dominating, is designated the 'biotic interaction phase'.4. Phase II, with massive nutrient inputs to the floodplain yet relatively high residence times, and therefore, high algal biomass, is classified as the 'primary production phase'. This demonstrates that water level fluctuations well below bankfull may considerably enhance floodplain productivity.5. Finally, since transport of particulate matter is mainly restricted to short flood pulses above bankfull level, phase III has been defined as the 'transport phase'.6. The floodplain served as a major sink for suspended sediments (250 mt ha(-1) year(-1)), FPOM (96 mt ha(-1) year(-1)), particulate organic carbon (POC; 2.9 mt ha(-1) year(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen (0.96 mt ha(-1) year(-1)), but was a source for dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 240 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), algal biomass (chlorophyll-a; 0.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and CPOM (21 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). Considerable quantities of DOC and algal biomass were exported to the river channel during phase II, whereas particulate matter transport was largely restricted to the short floods of phase III.7. The Danube Restoration Project will create a more gradual change between the individual phases by increasing hydrological connectivity between the river channel and the floodplain, and is predicted to enhance productivity by maintaining a balance between retention and export of nutrients and organic matter.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000081362000004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrological%2Bconnectivity%252C%2Band%2Bthe%2Bexchange%2Bof%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Band%2Bnutrients%2Bin%2Ba%2Bdynamic%2Briver-floodplain%2Bsystem%2B%2528Danube%252C%2BAustria%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DK%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DTockner%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.1999.00399.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D535%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D521-535%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D521%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DTockner%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DPennetzdorfer%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BJV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"Li, HY",Dec 2015 ,Modeling stream temperature in the Anthropocene: An earth system modeling approach,JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS,"A new large-scale stream temperature model has been developed within the Community Earth System Model (CESM) framework. The model is coupled with the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART) that represents river routing and a water management model (WM) that represents the effects of reservoir operations and water withdrawals on flow regulation. The coupled models allow the impacts of reservoir operations and withdrawals on stream temperature to be explicitly represented in a physically based and consistent way. The models have been applied to the Contiguous United States driven by observed meteorological forcing. Including water management in the models improves the agreement between the simulated and observed streamflow at a large number of stream gauge stations. It is then shown that the model is capable of reproducing stream temperature spatiotemporal variation satisfactorily by comparing against the observed data from over 320 USGS stations. Both climate and water management are found to have important influence on the spatiotemporal patterns of stream temperature. Furthermore, it is quantitatively estimated that reservoir operation could cool down stream temperature in the summer low-flow season (August-October) by as much as 1 approximate to 2 degrees C due to enhanced low-flow conditions, which have important implications to aquatic ecosystems. Sensitivity of the simulated stream temperature to input data and reservoir operation rules used in the WM model motivates future directions to address some limitations in the current modeling framework.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000368739800009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bstream%2Btemperature%2Bin%2Bthe%2BAnthropocene%253A%2BAn%2Bearth%2Bsystem%2Bmodeling%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DHong-Yi%26rft.auinit%3DHY%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015MS000471%26rft.eissn%3D1942-2466%26rft.epage%3D1679%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BADVANCES%2BIN%2BMODELING%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1661-1679%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1661%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BADV%2BMODEL%2BEARTH%2BSY%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BHY%26rft.au%3DLeung%252C%2BLR%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BXF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ADVANCES+IN+MODELING+EARTH+SYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
18,"Rao, NM",Jul 2005 ,Comparison of dynamic performance for direct and fluid coupled indirect heat exchange systems,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER,"Three different arrangements of heat exchange from a hot fluid stream to a cold fluid stream such as, direct heat exchanger and fluid coupled indirect heat exchanger both with forced circulation loop as well as thermally driven natural circulation loop have been considered in the present work. Dynamic performance of these three arrangements has been studied for four different excitations namely, step, ramp, exponential and sinusoidal. These excitations are imposed at the hot fluid inlet temperature. Finite element technique is used to solve the transient one-dimensional conservation equations. A thorough comparison of the dynamic performance of these three arrangements is made. It is found that the direct heat exchanger does not have any time delay between the response and the excitation function. Moreover, the phase difference between the sinusoidal excitation and response is the lowest in this case. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

19,"Augustsson, P",Mar 2009 ,Buffer medium exchange in continuous cell and particle streams using ultrasonic standing wave focusing,MICROCHIMICA ACTA,"A microfluidic strategy to perform buffer exchange of particle and cell suspensions in a continuous flow format on, chip is presented. Ultrasonic standing wave technology is utilized to confine particulate matter to the centre of a buffer exchange channel while particle free buffer is sequentially aspirated via capillaries that branch off from the buffer exchange channel. At each such branch, clean buffer is supplied at an equal flow-rate from a capillary at the opposing channel wall, generating a sideways translation of the original buffer, laminated with a wash buffer stream. Each such junction increases the buffer exchange ratio accordingly. The reported buffer exchange system provides means to adjust buffer exchange conditions on-line by tuning the ratio of the cross-flow wash buffer relative the sample suspension flow, rate. The system performance was evaluated using 5 mu m polystyrene microbeads and a dye as the model contaminant. Wash efficiencies up to 96.4% were accomplished with a 0.2% solid content bead suspension, using eight cross-flow junctions, effectively exchanging the carrier buffer twice. The corresponding data for erythrocyte washing was recorded to be 98.3% at a haematocrit of 2%.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000263381600006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBuffer%2Bmedium%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bcontinuous%2Bcell%2Band%2Bparticle%2Bstreams%2Busing%2Bultrasonic%2Bstanding%2Bwave%2Bfocusing%26rft.aufirst%3DPer%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DAugustsson%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00604-008-0084-4%26rft.epage%3D277%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0026-3672%26rft.issue%3D3-4%26rft.jtitle%3DMICROCHIMICA%2BACTA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D269-277%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D269%26rft.stitle%3DMICROCHIM%2BACTA%26rft.volume%3D164%26rft.au%3DAugustsson%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DAberg%252C%2BLB%26rft.au%3DLaurell%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=MICROCHIMICA+ACTA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Payn, RA",Nov 25 2009 ,"Channel water balance and exchange with subsurface flow along a mountain headwater stream in Montana, United States",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Channel water balances of contiguous reaches along streams represent a poorly understood scale of stream-subsurface interaction. We measured reach water balances along a headwater stream in Montana, United States, during summer base flow recessions. Reach water balances were estimated from series of tracer tests in 13 consecutive reaches delineated evenly along a 2.6 km valley segment. For each reach, we estimated net change in discharge, gross hydrologic loss, and gross hydrologic gain from tracer dilution and mass recovery. Four series of tracer tests were performed during relatively high, intermediate, and low base flow conditions. The relative distribution of channel water along the stream was strongly related to a transition in valley structure, with a general increase in gross losses through the recession. During tracer tests at intermediate and low flows, there were frequent substantial losses of tracer mass (>10%) that could not be explained by net loss in flow over the reach, indicating that many of the study reaches were concurrently losing and gaining water. For example, one reach with little net change in discharge exchanged nearly 20% of upstream flow with gains and losses along the reach. These substantial bidirectional exchanges suggest that some channel interactions with subsurface flow paths were not measurable by net change in flow or transient storage of recovered tracer. Understanding bidirectional channel water balances in stream reaches along valleys is critical to an accurate assessment of stream solute fate and transport and to a full assessment of exchanges between the stream channel and surrounding subsurface.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000272149300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW11427%26rft.atitle%3DChannel%2Bwater%2Bbalance%2Band%2Bexchange%2Bwith%2Bsubsurface%2Bflow%2Balong%2Ba%2Bmountain%2Bheadwater%2Bstream%2Bin%2BMontana%252C%2BUnited%2BStates%26rft.aufirst%3DR.%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DRA%26rft.aulast%3DPayn%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007644%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DPayn%252C%2BRA%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Hitt, NP",Jun 2008 ,Evidence for fish dispersal from spatial analysis of stream network topology,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Developing spatially explicit conservation strategies for stream fishes requires an understanding of the spatial structure of dispersal within stream networks. We explored spatial patterns of stream fish dispersal by evaluating how the size and proximity of connected streams (i.e., stream network topology) explained variation in fish assemblage structure and how this relationship varied with local stream size. We used data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in wadeable streams of the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region (n = 308 sites). We quantified stream network topology with a continuous analysis based on the rate of downstream flow accumulation from sites and with a discrete analysis based on the presence of mainstem river confluences (i.e., basin area >250 km(2)) within 20 fluvial km (flan) from sites. Continuous variation in stream network topology was related to local species richness within a distance of similar to 10 fkm, suggesting an influence of fish dispersal within this spatial grain. This effect was explained largely by catostomid species, cyprinid species, and riverine species, but was not explained by zoogeographic regions, ecoregions, sampling period, or spatial autocorrelation. Sites near mainstem river confluences supported greater species richness and abundance of catostomid, cyprinid, and ictalurid fishes than did sites >20 fkm from such confluences. Assemblages at sites on the smallest streams were not related to stream network topology, consistent with the hypothesis that local stream size regulates the influence of regional dispersal. These results demonstrate that the size and proximity of connected streams influence the spatial distribution of fish and suggest that these influences can be incorporated into the designs of stream bioassessments and reserves to enhance management efficacy.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000256178200007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvidence%2Bfor%2Bfish%2Bdispersal%2Bfrom%2Bspatial%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%2Btopology%26rft.aufirst%3DNathaniel%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DNP%26rft.aulast%3DHitt%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F07-096.1%26rft.epage%3D320%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D304-320%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D304%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DHitt%252C%2BNP%26rft.au%3DAngermeier%252C%2BPL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Fischer, CD",Dec 3 2014 ,Hydrogen recovery from the purge stream of a cyclohexane production process using a mass exchange heuristic,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY,"In this paper, we propose a novel hydrogen recovery structure in a cyclohexane production process, arrived at by following a mass exchange heuristic developed in previous works [1,2].In the cyclohexane production process considered, we explore the effect of process design variables and find the optimal design for a mass exchange between the purge stream and the feed of benzene to the process. We compare our results with a conventional process design lacking hydrogen recovery from the purge, and with a process design which implements a conventional membrane recovery system at the optimum setup of the decision variables. The process with recovery through mass exchange here proposed obtained a respectable 7.12% reduction of hydrogen consumption, resulting in an increase of the plant Net Annual Income of a 4.24% respect to the conventional process design without recovery. These figures are similar to the ones that result from implementing a process design with a conventional membrane recovery system. These results highlight the importance of considering a mass exchange between the process feed and purge stream as an alternative design of the recovery system.

Here, we have explored electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) of hyporheic exchange in Cement Creek near Silverton. Colorado, which is affected by ferricrete precipitation. To quantify flows through the HZ. we have conducted 4 h salt injection tracer tests and collected time-lapse ERT of the streambed and banks of Cement Creek at high and low flow. We have installed piezometers to conduct slug tests, which suggest a low-permeability zone at 44 cm depth likely composed of ferricrete that cemented the cobbles together. Based on the ERT, the tracer released into the stream is constrained within the shallow streambed with little subsurface flow through the banks. The tracer is detected in the HZ for a longer time at high flow compared to low flow, suggesting that more flow paths were available to connect the stream to the HZ. The tracer is confined above the ferricrete layer during the high- and low-flow tests. Mass transfer and storage area parameters are calculated from combined analysis of apparent hulk conductivity derived from ERT and numerical modeling of the tracer breakthrough curves. The hyporheic storage area estimated at low discharge (0.1 m(2)) is smaller than that at high discharge (0.4 m(2)) and residence times are 2.7 h at low discharge and 4.1 h at high discharge. During high discharge. in-stream breakthrough curves display slower breakthrough and longer tails, which is consistent with the time-lapse electrical inversions and ID transport with inflow and storage modeling.

25,"Michel, G",Jan 10 2019 ,Strong wave-mean-flow coupling in baroclinic acoustic streaming,JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS,"The interaction of an acoustic wave with a stratified fluid can drive strong streaming flows owing to the baroclinic production of fluctuating vorticity, as recently demonstrated by Chini et al. (J. Fluid Mech., 744, 2014, pp. 329-351). In the present investigation, a set of wave/mean-flow interaction equations is derived that governs the coupled dynamics of a standing acoustic-wave mode of characteristic (small) amplitude and the streaming flow it drives in a thin channel with walls maintained at differing temperatures. Unlike classical Rayleigh streaming, the resulting mean flow arises at rather than at . Consequently, fully two-way coupling between the waves and the mean flow is possible: the streaming is sufficiently strong to induce rearrangements of the imposed background temperature and density fields, which modifies the spatial structure and frequency of the acoustic mode on the streaming time scale. A novel Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys analysis is developed to average over the fast wave dynamics, enabling the coupled system to be integrated strictly on the slow time scale of the streaming flow. Analytical solutions of the reduced system are derived for weak wave forcing and are shown to reproduce results from prior direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the compressible Navier-Stokes and heat equations with remarkable accuracy. Moreover, numerical simulations of the reduced system are performed in the regime of strong wave/mean-flow coupling for a fraction of the computational cost of the corresponding DNS. These simulations shed light on the potential for baroclinic acoustic streaming to be used as an effective means to enhance heat transfer.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000526777100021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStrong%2Bwave-mean-flow%2Bcoupling%2Bin%2Bbaroclinic%2Bacoustic%2Bstreaming%26rft.aufirst%3DGuillaume%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DMichel%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1017%252Fjfm.2018.785%26rft.eissn%3D1469-7645%26rft.epage%3D564%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1120%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFLUID%2BMECHANICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D536-564%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D536%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BFLUID%2BMECH%26rft.volume%3D858%26rft.au%3DMichel%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DChini%252C%2BGP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+FLUID+MECHANICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
26,"Runkel, RL",Aug 2015 ,On the use of rhodamine WT for the characterization of stream hydrodynamics and transient storage,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Recent advances in fluorometry have led to increased use of rhodamine WT as a tracer in streams and rivers. In light of this increased use, a review of the dye's behavior in freshwater systems is presented. Studies in the groundwater literature indicate that rhodamine WT is transported nonconservatively, with sorption removing substantial amounts of tracer mass. Column studies document a two-step break-through curve in which two structural isomers are chromatographically separated. Although the potential for nonconservative transport is acknowledged in the surface water literature, many studies assume that sorptive losses will not affect the characterization of physical transport processes. A literature review and modeling analysis indicates that this assumption is valid for quantification of physical properties that are based on the bulk of the tracer mass (traveltime), and invalid for the characterization of processes represented by the tracer tail (transient storage attributable to hyporheic exchange). Rhodamine WT should be considered nonconservative in the hyporheic zone due to nonconservative behavior demonstrated for similar conditions in groundwater. As such, rhodamine WT should not be used as a quantitative tracer in hyporheic zone investigations, including the study of long flow paths and the development of models describing hyporheic zone processes. Rhodamine WT may be used to qualitatively characterize storage in large systems, where there are few practical alternatives. Qualitative investigations should rely on early portions of the tracer profile, making use of the temporal resolution afforded by in situ fluorometry, while discarding later parts of the tracer profile that are adversely affected by sorption.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000363402800015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2Bthe%2Buse%2Bof%2Brhodamine%2BWT%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bcharacterization%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bhydrodynamics%2Band%2Btransient%2Bstorage%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DRL%26rft.aulast%3DRunkel%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017201%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6142%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6125-6142%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6125%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"Suren, AM",Nov 2009 ,Using Macrophytes in Urban Stream Rehabilitation: A Cautionary Tale,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,"Native macrophytes were transplanted into a small urban stream as part of a rehabilitation program, that also meandered the previously channeled stream, naturalized stream banks, and planted native riparian vegetation. Transplanted macrophytes minimized spread of introduced macrophytes and were viewed beneficially by residents, as was the stream rehabilitation. We transplanted the native macrophyte Myriophyllum triphyllum into five larger streams dominated by exotic macrophytes-some of which were weeded prior to transplanting-to see whether Myriophyllum could prevent regrowth of weeded plants. Transplanted Myriophyllum plants were washed away in two streams, reflecting high shear stresses there. Myriophyllum cover in the other streams decreased as weeded plants regrew. Our attempt at eliminating exotic macrophytes in patches in large streams was unsuccessful. Furthermore, council authorities weeded other experimental sections following complaints from residents of excess macrophyte growth. This problem highlighted conflicting multiple values placed on urban streams by managers and the public. A repeat survey of residents living near the original rehabilitated stream showed that many respondents were now critical of excessive plant growth-both in-stream and riparian. A recurring comment made concerned the apparent lack of maintenance to the stream, giving it an untidy appearance. Difficulties with propagating and transplanting native macrophytes into larger streams, coupled with a negative perception of native vegetation (both in-stream and riparian) if it looks unmanaged, suggest that planting macrophytes or riparian plants as part of urban stream rehabilitation programs may be more problematic than realized.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000272131700013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2BMacrophytes%2Bin%2BUrban%2BStream%2BRehabilitation%253A%2BA%2BCautionary%2BTale%26rft.aufirst%3DAlastair%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DSuren%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1526-100X.2008.00446.x%26rft.epage%3D883%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1061-2971%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DRESTORATION%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D873-883%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D873%26rft.stitle%3DRESTOR%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D17&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=RESTORATION+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
28,"Sok, T",Mar 2022 ,Nutrient transport and exchange between the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"The Mekong River in Asia is one of the world's longest rivers. Although it has some of the highest levels of biodiversity and productivity in Asia, the water quality in the basin has recently deteriorated as a consequence of land use changes, dam reservoir construction, population growth, and climate change. For the first time, this study estimates the interannual and monthly variabilities of nutrient fluxes (nitrate - NO3-) and total phosphorus - TP) in the lower Mekong River and Tonle Sap River in Cambodia, and assesses the nutrient linkage between the them. Long-term monitoring data were obtained from Kratie station (in the upper reach of the Mekong River), Chroy Changva station (just upstream of the lower Mekong River-Tonle Sap River confluence), and Prek Kdam station (on the Tonle Sap River similar to 40 km upstream of the confluence and 70 km downstream of Tonle Sap Lake). From 1995 to 2017, the estimated interannual flux of NO3- was 364 +/- 45 kt/y at Kratie and 557 +/- 109 kt/y at Chroy Changva. From 2005 to 2017, the estimated interannual flux of TP was 100 +/- 16 kt/y at Kratie and 73 +/- 19 kt/y at Chroy Changva. Considerable seasonal differences were observed in both fluxes in the Mekong River, with 80-90% of the annual NO3- flux occurring from May to October. The results of the nutrient exchange budget indicated that the NO3- and TP fluxes from the Mekong River into Tonle Sap Lake were similar to 35.8 +/- 12.5 kt/y and similar to 8.7 +/- 3.3 kt/y, respectively, while these were 34.0 +/- 13.8 kt/y and 6.6 +/- 1.4 kt/y, respectively, from Tonle Sap Lake into the Mekong system.

30,"Millot, R",Feb 2021 ,Lithium isotopes in the Loire River Basin (France): Hydrogeochemical characterizations at two complementary scales,APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"We illustrate two different, but complementary, applications of lithium (Li) isotope tracers for river-basin characterization at two different scales within the Loire River basin (LRB) in France. The first example deals with the behaviour of Li and the fractionation of its isotopes during river weathering at the basin scale of the LRB (117,800 km2). The wide delta 7Li range (+5.0 to +13.3%o) in Loire basin streams, spatialized between the headwaters and the lowlands, is consistent with distinct weathering conditions and the distribution of Li from bedrock in the basin between the rivers and secondary mineral phases during water/rock interaction. Additionally, suspended sediments in the LRB streams are significantly 6Li enriched (delta 7Li from-8.7 to-7.6%o) compared to average river waters that range from +5.0 to +13.3%o. The second example focuses on the smaller scale Egoutier watershed (13 km2), part of the LRB, which shows that Li isotopes can be useful for distinguishing between natural input and anthropogenic pollution, like effluents from a water treatment plant connected to a hospital. Overall, we confirm that Li isotopes cannot be used as lithological tracers for river waters. However, we did find that Li isotopes can be good tracers of weathering conditions and of anthropogenic sources in an urbanized watershed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000612516700008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B104831%26rft.atitle%3DLithium%2Bisotopes%2Bin%2Bthe%2BLoire%2BRiver%2BBasin%2B%2528France%2529%253A%2BHydrogeochemical%2Bcharacterizations%2Bat%2Btwo%2Bcomplementary%2Bscales%26rft.aufirst%3DRomain%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DMillot%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.apgeochem.2020.104831%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9134%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0883-2927%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BGEOCHEM%26rft.volume%3D125%26rft.au%3DMillot%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DNegrel%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+GEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
31,"Datry, T",Aug 2008 ,River flow controls ecological processes and invertebrate assemblages in subsurface flowpaths of an ephemeral river reach,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"We present the first measurements of solutes, invertebrates, and microbial activity in the semi-perched hyporheic, parafluvial, and riparian flowpaths of an ephemeral river channel. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC). nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP) concentrations decreased as water from an adjacent river mainstem moved through the flowpaths. DOC, DON, and DOP processing rates decreased with increasing mainstem flow and increased with parafluvial zone length. These patterns suggest that the surface water zones of perched river systems are organic nutrient sources to subsurface flowpaths and that parafluvial zones of these systems are strong sinks for organic matter. No longitudinal changes were detected in NO3- concentrations, and relationships between NO3- processing and hydrological variables were not significant. NO3- concentrations were uniformly high, and microbial activity and DOC and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations were low, suggesting that biological NO3- removal was carbon- or phosphorus-limited. Invertebrate assemblages also varied between subsurface zones: density and taxon richness in the hyporheic and parafluvial zones were higher than in the riparian zone, and evenness was higher in the riparian zone than in the hyporheic or parafluvial zones.

The largest shallow lake, Poyang Lake, as well as the most typical river-connected lake in China was selected as the research area. In view of the complicated water-sediment conditions induced by its frequent water exchange with external rivers, the dominant factors driving water transparency were determined against the field investigated data from 2003 to 2013 and a specific driving function was established. A numerical model coupling suspended sediment, Chl-a and chemical oxygen demand was developed and validated, and the spatial water transparency distributions under three typical current structures in Poyang Lake, Gravity-style, Jacking-style and Backflow-style, were quantitatively estimated. The following results stood out: water transparency in the lake varied distinctly with the current status; Backflow-style current was basically characterized by the lowest water transparency, while that under Jacking-style was the highest due to the lower sediment carrying capacity. In some outlying regions in the lake, where the water current is hardly influenced by the mainstream, the water transparency was always kept at a stable level.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000392395800018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWater%2Btransparency%2Bdistribution%2Bunder%2Bvaried%2Bcurrents%2Bin%2Bthe%2Blargest%2Briver-connected%2Blake%2Bof%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DHua%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fwst.2016.534%26rft.eissn%3D1996-9732%26rft.epage%3D417%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0273-1223%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D406-417%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D406%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D75%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BYJ%26rft.au%3DLiang%252C%2BDF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=WATER+SCIENCE+AND+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
33,"Jonoski, A",Dec 2019 ,Analysis of Flood Storage Area Operations in Huai River Using 1D and 2D River Simulation Models Coupled with Global Optimization Algorithms,GEOSCIENCES,"This article addresses the issue of flood management using four flood storage areas in the middle section of Huai River in China which protect the important downstream city of Bengbu. The same areas are also used by the local population as residential and agricultural zones. An optimization problem is therefore posed, with two objectives of simultaneously minimizing the downstream flood risk in Bengbu city and the storage areas' economic damages. The methodology involved development of river flood models using HEC-RAS, with varying complexity, such as 1-dimensional (1D) model with storage areas represented as lumped conceptual reservoirs, and 2-dimensional (2D) models with detailed representation of the terrain, land-use and hydrodynamics in the storage areas. Experiments of coupling these models with global optimization algorithms (NSGA-II, PESA-II and SPEA-II) were performed (using the HEC-RAS Controller), in which the two objective functions were minimized, while using stage differences between the river and the storage areas as decision variables for controlling the opening/closing of the gates at the lateral structures that link the river with the storage areas. The comparative analysis of the results indicate that more refined optimal operational strategies that spread the damages across all storage areas can be obtained only with the detailed flood simulation models, regardless of the optimization algorithm used.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000506643100023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B509%26rft.atitle%3DAnalysis%2Bof%2BFlood%2BStorage%2BArea%2BOperations%2Bin%2BHuai%2BRiver%2BUsing%2B1D%2Band%2B2D%2BRiver%2BSimulation%2BModels%2BCoupled%2Bwith%2BGlobal%2BOptimization%2BAlgorithms%26rft.aufirst%3DAndreja%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DJonoski%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fgeosciences9120509%26rft.eissn%3D2076-3263%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOSCIENCES%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DJonoski%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DPopescu%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DHe%252C%2BYQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=GEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

35,"Li, SY",Feb 4 2019 ,Gas transfer velocities of CO2 in subtropical monsoonal climate streams and small rivers,BIOGEOSCIENCES,"CO2 outgassing from rivers is a critical component for evaluating riverine carbon cycle, but it is poorly quantified largely due to limited measurements and modeling of gas transfer velocity in subtropical streams and rivers. We measured CO2 flux rates and calculated k and partial pressure (pCO(2)) in 60 river networks of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region, a typical area in the upper Yangtze River with monsoonal climate and mountainous terrain. The determined k(600) (gas transfer velocity normalized to a Schmidt number of 600 (k(600)) at a temperature of 20 degrees C) value (48.4 +/- 53.2 cm h(-1)) showed large variability due to spatial variations in physical processes related to surface water turbulence. Our flux-derived k values using chambers were comparable with k values using the model derived from flow velocities based on a subset of data. Unlike in open waters, e.g., lakes, k(600) is more pertinent to flow velocity and water depth in the studied river systems. Our results show that TGR river networks emitted approx. 0.69 to 0.71 TgCO(2) (1 Tg = 10(12) g) during the monsoon period using varying approaches such as chambers, derived k(600) values and models. This study suggests that incorporating scale-appropriate k measurements into extensive pCO(2) investigations is required to refine basin-wide carbon budgets in subtropical streams and small rivers. We concluded that the simple parameteri-zation of k(600) as a function of morphological characteristics is site specific for regions and watersheds and hence highly variable in rivers of the upper Yangtze. k(600) models should be developed for stream studies to evaluate the contribution of these regions to atmospheric CO2.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000457558000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGas%2Btransfer%2Bvelocities%2Bof%2BCO2%2Bin%2Bsubtropical%2Bmonsoonal%2Bclimate%2Bstreams%2Band%2Bsmall%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DSiyue%26rft.auinit%3DSY%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fbg-16-681-2019%26rft.eissn%3D1726-4189%26rft.epage%3D693%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1726-4170%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D681-693%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D681%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft.volume%3D16%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BSY%26rft.au%3DMao%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DSarma%252C%2BVVSS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

An aqua regia digestion coupled to ICP-MS analysis has been performed on the samples. The distribution of Cr and Ni concentration as a function of grain size was also investigated, comparing finer samples (<63 mu m) and coarse samples (<2000 mu m). In Possera Creek samples, a left tributary of the Cecina River, another sieve fraction (< 125 mu m) was sampled. The high levels of Cr and Ni in the stream sediments often exceed the thresholds of the Italian law currently in force (Legislative Decree No. 152/2006). Multivariate data analysis techniques (Hierarchical Clustering Analysis, HCA) were used to obtain information about the potential sources of heavy metals. The results indicate an Cr and Ni enrichment in stream sediments due to the presence of some extensive outcrops of serpentinized ultramafic rocks (ophiolites).

37,"Sedell, ER",Dec 2015 ,Predicting spatial distribution of postfire debris flows and potential consequences for native trout in headwater streams,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Habitat fragmentation and degradation and invasion of nonnative species have restricted the distribution of native trout. Many trout populations are limited to headwater streams where negative effects of predicted climate change, including reduced stream flow and increased risk of catastrophic fires, may further jeopardize their persistence. Headwater streams in steep terrain are especially susceptible to disturbance associated with postfire debris flows, which have led to local extirpation of trout populations in some systems. We conducted a reach-scale spatial analysis of debris-flow risk among 11 high-elevation watersheds of the Colorado Rocky Mountains occupied by isolated populations of Colorado River Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus). Stream reaches at high risk of disturbance by postfire debris flow were identified with the aid of a qualitative model based on 4 primary initiating and transport factors (hillslope gradient, flow accumulation pathways, channel gradient, and valley confinement). This model was coupled with a spatially continuous survey of trout distributions in these stream networks to assess the predicted extent of trout population disturbances related to debris flows. In the study systems, debris-flow potential was highest in the lower and middle reaches of most watersheds. Colorado River Cutthroat Trout occurred in areas of high postfire debris-flow risk, but they were never restricted to those areas. Postfire debris flows could extirpate trout from local reaches in these watersheds, but trout populations occupy refugia that should allow recolonization of interconnected, downstream reaches. Specific results of our study may not be universally applicable, but our risk assessment approach can be applied to assess postfire debris-flow risk for stream reaches in other watersheds.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000364815000028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPredicting%2Bspatial%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2Bpostfire%2Bdebris%2Bflows%2Band%2Bpotential%2Bconsequences%2Bfor%2Bnative%2Btrout%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DEdwin%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DER%26rft.aulast%3DSedell%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F684094%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D1570%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1558-1570%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1558%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DSedell%252C%2BER%26rft.au%3DGresswell%252C%2BRE%26rft.au%3DMcMahon%252C%2BTE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
38,"Hansen, HH",Nov 25 2022 ,Resilient rivers and connected marine systems: a review of mutual sustainability opportunities,,"Non-technical summaryRivers are crucial to the water cycle, linking the landscape to the sea. Human activities, including effluent discharge, water use and fisheries, have transformed the resilience of many rivers around the globe. Sustainable development goal (SDG) 14 prioritizes addressing many of the same issues in marine ecosystems. This review illustrates how rivers contribute directly and indirectly to SDG 14 outcomes, and also provides ways to potentially address them through a river to sea view on policy, management and research. Technical summaryThe United Nations initiated the SDGs to produce 'a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future'. Established in 2015, progress of SDGs directed at the aquatic environment is slow despite an encroaching 2030 deadline. The modification of flow regimes combined with other anthropogenic pressures underpin ecological impacts across aquatic ecosystems. Current SDG 14 targets (life below water) do not incorporate the interrelationships of rivers and marine systems systematically, nor do they provide recommendations on how to improve existing management and policy in a comprehensive manner. Therefore, this review aims to illustrate the linkages between rivers and marine ecosystems concerning the SDG 14 targets and to illustrate land to sea-based strategies to reach sustainability goals. We provide an applied case study to show how opportunities can be explored. We review three major areas where mutual opportunities are present: (1) rivers contribute to marine and estuary ecosystem resilience (targets 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.5); (2) resilient rivers are part of the global fisheries sustainability concerns (targets 14.4, 14.6, 14.7, 14.B) and (3) enhancing marine policy and research from a river and environmental flows perspective (targets 14.A, 14.C).

39,"Imholt, C",Jun 2013 ,Influence of contrasting riparian forest cover on stream temperature dynamics in salmonid spawning and nursery streams,ECOHYDROLOGY,"In this paper, we investigated the influence of contrasting riparian forest types on upland stream temperatures and the links between thermal regime and standard indices of forest cover. Stream temperature was measured for two hydrological years at multiple sites along two tributaries of the River Dee, Scotland. Riparian cover in the upper reaches of both streams was dominated by Calluna moorland while the lower sections comprised either dense alluvial broadleaved forest (Girnock Burn) or native Scots Pine stands (Tanar). The Point-Centered-Quarter Method was used to quantify stem density (SD) and tree coverage (TC) as an indicator of channel shading comprising either dense alluvial broadleaved forest (Girnock Burn) or native Scots Pine stands (Tanar). The greatest reductions in maximum temperature (4 degrees C) and diel amplitude (6 center dot 6 degrees C) were observed where TC and SD were greatest in areas of relatively dense broadleaved riparian cover. Analysis of the relationship between forest characteristics and temperature summary statistics revealed that SD and TC were significant predictors of mean and maximum temperatures, as well as daily temperature ranges for both rivers during the summer. The relationship between summer thermal indices and indicators of channel shading (SD or TC) was independent of forest type. However, as SD and TC were greater in the deciduous reaches of Glen Girnock than the mature Scots pine reaches of Glen Tanar, maximum reductions in stream temperature were greater in Glen Girnock. Given that maximum temperatures were strongly influenced by measures of shading, it suggested that riparian planting may offer a suitable mitigation against high temperatures under climate change.

40,"Mesa, LM",2012 ,"Bidirectional exchanges of benthic invertebrates in a large river-floodplain system (Parana River, Argentina)",ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"The flood pulse regime and the hydrological connectivity determine the lateral bidirectional exchanges of water, chemical compounds, and biota between the river and the floodplain habitats. The primary goal of the present research was to analyze the effect of water flow on macroinvertebrates in two water levels in a lateral connectivity gradient, from the main channel through a connection channel to a permanently connected lake. We tested the hypothesis that the water flow from the main channel to the floodplain habitats during high water level causes a decrease in beta diversity between the sites, increasing similarity in the system. To test this hypothesis, we sampled a river-floodplain-lake system of the Middle Parana River during two water levels, and analyzed the spatial and temporal turnover of species between sites and habitats. Local physical characteristics, such as depth, benthic particulate organic matter, and grain size of bottom sediments influenced assemblage composition. Taxa richness, density, and Shannon diversity differed among habitats within the river-lake system, but did not show significant differences between water levels. Richness, density, and diversity were higher in the lake and the connection channel than in the Parana River bank. Beta diversity was significantly higher during high water period. During low water period, benthic assemblage composition was homogenized, as reflected by the lower values of species turnover between the sites situated in the main channel-lake corridor during this phase. The lateral bidirectional exchanges among the habitats are essential for maintaining the specific invertebrate diversity of large river corridors.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000315949800008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBidirectional%2Bexchanges%2Bof%2Bbenthic%2Binvertebrates%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Briver-floodplain%2Bsystem%2B%2528Parana%2BRiver%252C%2BArgentina%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DLeticia%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DLM%26rft.aulast%3DMesa%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Flimn%252F2012030%26rft.eissn%3D2100-000X%26rft.epage%3D436%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-4088%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DANNALES%2BDE%2BLIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D425-436%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D425%26rft.stitle%3DANN%2BLIMNOL-INT%2BJ%2BLIM%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DMesa%252C%2BLM%26rft.au%3DMarchese%252C%2BMR%26rft.au%3DZilli%252C%2BFL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=ANNALES+DE+LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Rosamond, MS",Jan-feb 2011 ,"Coupled Cycles of Dissolved Oxygen and Nitrous Oxide in Rivers along a Trophic Gradient in Southern Ontario, Canada",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY,"Diel (24-h) cycling of dissolved O-2 (DO) in rivers is well documented, but evidence for coupled diel changes in DO and nitrogen cycling has only been demonstrated in hypereutrophic systems where DO approaches zero at night. Here, we show diel changes in N2O and DO concentration at several sites across a trophic gradient. Nitrous oxide concentration increased at night at all but one site in spring and summer, even when gas exchange was rapid and minimum water column DO was well above hypoxic conditions. Diel N2O curves were not mirror images of DO curves and were not symmetrical about the mean. Although inter-and intrasite variation was high, N2O peaked around the time of lowest DO at most of the sites. These results suggest that N2O must be measured several times per diel period to characterize curve shape and timing. Nitrous oxide concentration was not significantly correlated with NO3- concentration, contrary to studies in agricultural streams and to the current United Nations Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change protocols for N2O emission estimation. The strong negative correlation between N2O concentration and daily minimum DO concentration suggested that N2O production was limited by DO. This is consistent with N2O produced by nitrite reduction. The ubiquity of diel N2O cycling suggests that most DO and N2O sampling strategies used in rivers are insufficient to capture natural variability. Ecosystem-level effects of microbial processes, such as denitrification, are sensitive to small changes in redox conditions in the water column even in low-nutrient oxic rivers, suggesting diel cycling of redox-sensitive compounds may exist in many aquatic systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000285715300029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2BCycles%2Bof%2BDissolved%2BOxygen%2Band%2BNitrous%2BOxide%2Bin%2BRivers%2Balong%2Ba%2BTrophic%2BGradient%2Bin%2BSouthern%2BOntario%252C%2BCanada%26rft.aufirst%3DMadeline%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DMS%26rft.aulast%3DRosamond%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2134%252Fjeq2010.0009%26rft.eissn%3D1537-2537%26rft.epage%3D270%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0047-2425%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BQUALITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D256-270%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D256%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BQUAL%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DRosamond%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DThuss%252C%2BSJ%26rft.au%3DElgood%252C%2BRJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+QUALITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Packman, AI",Aug 2000 ,A physicochemical model for colloid exchange between a stream and a sand streambed with bed forms,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Fine sediment exchange between a stream and the surrounding subsurface influences downstream contaminant transport and stream ecology. Fundamental models for this exchange were developed on the basis of (1) the hydraulics of bed form-driven advective pore water flow and (2) subsurface colloid transport processes. First, a model was developed to predict the advective flow induced in a sand bed by stream flow over bedforms. The resulting ""pumping"" exchange rate was calculated based on the streamflow conditions, bed form geometry, and bed depth. The pumping exchange of suspended sediment was then calculated by superimposing advective transport and particle setting in the bed and including the effect of physicochemical filtration by bed sediment. The filtration coefficient approach was used to predict the reduction in the concentration of transported particles. Both settling and filtration cause colloids to be trapped in stream beds, producing a higher net exchange rate relative to conservative solutes. When transported particles are completely trapped in a single pass through the bed, the exchange calculation is simplified because only the particle flux to the bed must be considered. In this case, the net exchange rate may be adequately represented by an effective piston velocity (flux/concentration) or loss rate to the bed in the advection-dispersion equation for the stream. Solute and colloid exchanges are predicted by the models without the use of fitting coefficients; only measurable hydraulic and particle parameters were used as model inputs. Simulations are presented which show the effect of stream parameters, settling, and filtration on net particle exchange. This fundamental approach to modeling stream-subsurface exchange potentially has great utility for understanding and predicting the transport and fate of reactive substances in streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000088554500029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bphysicochemical%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bcolloid%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Ba%2Bstream%2Band%2Ba%2Bsand%2Bstreambed%2Bwith%2Bbed%2Bforms%26rft.aufirst%3DAI%26rft.auinit%3DAI%26rft.aulast%3DPackman%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2000WR900059%26rft.epage%3D2361%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2351-2361%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2351%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DBrooks%252C%2BNH%26rft.au%3DMorgan%252C%2BJJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Broecker, T",Jul 2019 ,Integral Flow Modelling Approach for Surface Water-Groundwater Interactions along a Rippled Streambed,WATER,"Exchange processes of surface and groundwater are important for the management of water quantity and quality as well as for the ecological functioning. In contrast to most numerical simulations using coupled models to investigate these processes, we present a novel integral formulation for the sediment-water-interface. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model OpenFOAM was used to solve an extended version of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations which is also applicable in non-Darcy-flow layers. Simulations were conducted to determine the influence of ripple morphologies and surface hydraulics on the flow processes within the hyporheic zone for a sandy and for a gravel sediment. In- and outflowing exchange fluxes along a ripple were determined for each case. The results indicate that larger grain size diameters, as well as ripple distances, increased hyporheic exchange fluxes significantly. For higher ripple dimensions, no clear relationship to hyporheic exchange was found. Larger ripple lengths decreased the hyporheic exchange fluxes due to less turbulence between the ripples. For all cases with sand, non-Darcy-flow was observed at an upper layer of the ripple, whereas for gravel non-Darcy-flow was recognized nearly down to the bottom boundary. Moreover, the sediment grain sizes influenced also the surface water flow significantly.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000480632300202,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1517%26rft.atitle%3DIntegral%2BFlow%2BModelling%2BApproach%2Bfor%2BSurface%2BWater-Groundwater%2BInteractions%2Balong%2Ba%2BRippled%2BStreambed%26rft.aufirst%3DTabea%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DBroecker%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw11071517%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2073-4441%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DBroecker%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DTeuber%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DHinkelmann%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
44,"Tranmer, AW",Apr 15 2020 ,Coupled reservoir-river systems: Lessons from an integrated aquatic ecosystem assessment,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Sustainable reservoir-river management requires balancing complex trade-offs and decision-making to support both human water demands and ecological function. Current numerical simulation and optimization algorithms can guide reservoir-river operations for optimal hydropower production, irrigation, nutrient management, and municipal consumption, yet much less is known about optimization of associated ecosystems. This ten-year study demonstrates an ecosystem assessment approach that links the environmental processes to an ecosystem response in order to evaluate the impact of climatic forcing and reservoir operations on the aquatic ecosystems of a coupled headwater reservoir-river system. The approach uses a series of numerical, statistical, and empirical models to explore reservoir operational flexibility aimed at improving the environmental processes that support aquatic ecosystem function. The results illustrate that understanding the seasonal biogeochemical changes in reservoirs is critical for determining environmental flow releases and the ecological trajectory of both the reservoir and river systems. The coupled models show that reservoir management can improve the ecological function of complex aquatic ecosystems under certain climatic conditions. During dry hydrologic years, the high post-irrigation release can increase the downstream primary and macroinvertebrate production by 99% and 45% respectively. However, this flow release would reduce total fish biomass in the reservoir by 16%, providing management tradeoffs to the different ecosystems. Additionally, low post-irrigation flows during the winter season supports water temperature that can maintain ice cover in the downstream river for improved ecosystem function. The ecosystem assessment approach provides operational flexibility for large infrastructure, supports transparent decision-making by management agencies, and facilitates framing of environmental legislation.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000517661900013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B110107%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Breservoir-river%2Bsystems%253A%2BLessons%2Bfrom%2Ban%2Bintegrated%2Baquatic%2Becosystem%2Bassessment%26rft.aufirst%3DAndrew%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DAW%26rft.aulast%3DTranmer%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jenvman.2020.110107%26rft.eissn%3D1095-8630%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0301-4797%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BMANAGE%26rft.volume%3D260%26rft.au%3DTranmer%252C%2BAW%26rft.au%3DWeigel%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DImberger%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
45,"Langhans, SD",Aug 1 2016 ,Coupling systematic planning and expert judgement enhances the efficiency of river restoration,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Ineffectiveness of current river restoration practices hinders the achievement of ecological quality targets set by country-specific regulations. Recent advances in river restoration help planning efforts more systematically to reach ecological targets at the least costs. However, such approaches are often desktop-based and overlook real-world constraints. We argue that combining two techniques commonly used in the conservation arena - expert judgement and systematic planning - will deliver cost-effective restoration plans with a high potential for implementation. We tested this idea targeting the restoration of spawning habitat, i.e. gravel bars, for 11 rheophilic fish species along a river system in Germany (Havel-Spree rivers). With a group of local fish experts, we identified the location and extent of potential gravel bars along the rivers and necessary improvements to migration barriers to ensure fish passage. Restoration cost of each gravel bar included the cost of the action itself plus a fraction of the cost necessary to ensure longitudinal connectivity by upgrading or building fish passages located downstream. We set restoration targets according to the EU Water Framework Directive, i.e. relative abundance of 11 fish species in the reference community and optimised a restoration plan by prioritising a subset of restoration sites from the full set of identified sites, using the conservation planning software Marxan. Out of the 66 potential gravel bars, 36 sites which were mainly located in the downstream section of the system were selected, reflecting their cost-effectiveness given that fewer barriers needed intervention. Due to the limited overall number of sites that experts identified as being suitable for restoring spawning habitat, reaching abundance-targets was challenged. We conclude that coupling systematic river restoration planning with expert judgement produces optimised restoration plans that account for on-the-ground implementation constraints. If applied, this approach has a high potential to enhance overall efficiency of future restoration efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This review considers riparian areas alongside small streams in forested, mountainous areas of the Pacific Northwest and asks if there are fundamental ecological differences from larger streams and from other regions and if there are consequences for management from any differences. In the moist forests along many small streams of the Pacific Northwest, the contrast between the streamside and upslope forest is not as strong as that found in drier regions. Small streams typically lack floodplains, and the riparian area is often constrained by the hillslope. Nevertheless, riparian-associated organisms, some unique to headwater areas, are found along small streams. Disturbance of hillslopes and stream channels and microclimatic effects of streams on the riparian area provide great heterogeneity in processes and diversity of habitats. The tight coupling of the terrestrial riparian area with the aquatic system results from the closed canopy and high edge-to-area ratio for small streams. Riparian areas of the temperate, conifer dominated forests of the Pacific Northwest provide a unique environment. Forest management guidelines for small streams vary widely, and there has been little evaluation of the local or downstream consequences of forest practices along small streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000231549900010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiparian%2Bcommunities%2Bassociated%2Bwith%2BPacific%2BNorthwest%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%253A%2BAssemblages%252C%2Bprocesses%252C%2Band%2Buniqueness%26rft.aufirst%3DJS%26rft.auinit%3DJS%26rft.aulast%3DRichardson%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1752-1688.2005.tb04471.x%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D947%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D935-947%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D935%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DRichardson%252C%2BJS%26rft.au%3DNaiman%252C%2BRJ%26rft.au%3DHibbs%252C%2BDE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
47,"Bolpagni, R",Jan 2017 ,Role of ephemeral vegetation of emerging river bottoms in modulating CO2 exchanges across a temperate large lowland river stretch,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Rivers and marginal wetlands contribute significantly to the carbon (C) exchange rate per unit area compared to adjacent terrestrial ecosystems, due to high C inputs, metabolic activity and CO2 supersaturation. Within riverscapes, the contribution of emerging bottoms (i.e. parafluvial zones) and ephemeral vegetation (i.e. microphytobenthos or annual vascular plant communities) to the C metabolism is understudied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CO2 exchange rates at the water- and emergent sand bar-atmosphere interfaces within a lowland large temperate river stretch. CO2 fluxes were measured seasonally, in summer (August 2007) and winter (March 2008) via static closed chambers, together with the primary producers' biomass (microphytobenthos and vascular macrophytes). Our results showed that the river was a CO2 source (between 0.2 and 7.6 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1)), whilst the vegetated parafluvial zones acted as a net sink, with assimilation rates peaking at 623.4 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1). Emerging bare sediments were on the contrary net emitting CO2 systems (2.7-60.1 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1)). Within lotic environments, seasonally emergent vegetated sand bars may represent important C fixation hot spots, with summer primary production particularly contributing to offsetting CO2 emissions and counterbalancing the heterotrophic metabolism of the saturated zones. Based on these outcomes, we suggest that studies addressing the strictly aquatic fluvial environment, which is generally a CO2 emitter, should be linked to those from transitional areas in order to better integrate terrestrial and aquatic C budgets.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394107900012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRole%2Bof%2Bephemeral%2Bvegetation%2Bof%2Bemerging%2Briver%2Bbottoms%2Bin%2Bmodulating%2BCO2%2Bexchanges%2Bacross%2Ba%2Btemperate%2Blarge%2Blowland%2Briver%2Bstretch%26rft.aufirst%3DRossano%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DBolpagni%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-016-0486-z%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D158%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D149-158%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D149%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D79%26rft.au%3DBolpagni%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DFolegot%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DBartoli%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Yu, K",Nov 2 2019 ,Development and performance of a 1D?2D coupled shallow water model for large river and lake networks,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH,"A one-dimensional (1D) ? two-dimensional (2D) coupled numerical model for shallow-water flows is developed, inspired by a large river-lake network. The model includes an improved method of coupling subdomains as part of the water stage prediction-correction (WSPC) approach, exploiting the characteristic curves of the shallow-water equations. Compared to other coupling methods, the one presented here results in better computational efficiency, convergence and stability. The coupling method uses parameters with a clear physical meaning, which can be set directly without appealing to empirical values. With the help of the WSPC approach, individual submodels are solved separately with their coupling parameters being consistent with each other at the coupling boundaries. The coupling method proposed herein allows large time-stepping for the coupled model. Practical approaches to achieve large time steps are discussed and analysed by comparing two different solution algorithms for the 2D submodel. The proposed method and model are examined by applying to a real-life case in China, and the results indicate their good validity, practicality and computational superiority.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000494494400009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDevelopment%2Band%2Bperformance%2Bof%2Ba%2B1D%253F2D%2Bcoupled%2Bshallow%2Bwater%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Blarge%2Briver%2Band%2Blake%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DKang%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DYu%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F00221686.2018.1534286%26rft.eissn%3D1814-2079%26rft.epage%3D865%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1686%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D852-865%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D852%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DYu%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BYC%26rft.au%3DLin%252C%2BJQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Xiang, L",Aug 2020 ,Water diversion and allocation for typical confined polder river-net in Taihu Basin,WATER POLICY,"Hydraulic restoration in a confined polder river-net is a new issue under the concept of the Interconnected River System Network (IRSN) proposed by the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) in China. This paper studies the typical hydrographic connection in the polder, and analyses the current situation of the hydrographic river-net in the typical area of Subaiwei in Changshu City by setting up a one-dimensional unsteady hydrodynamic model. The best water diversion-allocation schemes in the confined polder river-net are simulated and optimized in various scheduling rules. In order to recover the ability of hydro-connection and stream function, the effects of different scheduling rules and the duration time of water diversion under the ability of pump stations around polder boundary are compared. The results show that the optimized injects can enhance the total flow velocity and the exchange rate is more than 20% on average in various streams. This study is critical for the sustainable utilization of limited clean water in a confined river-net polder, and for quantifying the water ecological recharge for hydrodynamic connection.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000566241000004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWater%2Bdiversion%2Band%2Ballocation%2Bfor%2Btypical%2Bconfined%2Bpolder%2Briver-net%2Bin%2BTaihu%2BBasin%26rft.aufirst%3DLong%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DXiang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fwp.2020.107%26rft.epage%3D573%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1366-7017%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BPOLICY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D561-573%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D561%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BPOLICY%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DXiang%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DMa%252C%2BMT%26rft.au%3DLiao%252C%2BZM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84zRrfeQWL39e2KcJixyK&SrcJTitle=WATER+POLICY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
