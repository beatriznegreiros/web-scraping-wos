0,0,"Fox, A",May 16 2018 ,Interactions Between Suspended Kaolinite Deposition and Hyporheic Exchange Flux Under Losing and Gaining Flow Conditions,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Fine particle deposition and streambed clogging affect many ecological and biogeochemical processes, but little is known about the effects of groundwater flow into and out of rivers on clogging. We evaluated the effects of losing and gaining flow on the deposition of suspended kaolinite clay particles in a sand streambed and the resulting changes in rates and patterns of hyporheic exchange flux (HEF). Observations of clay deposition from the water column, clay accumulation in the streambed sediments, and water exchange with the bed demonstrated that clay deposition in the bed substantially reduced both HEF and the size of the hyporheic zone. Clay deposition and HEF were strongly coupled, leading to rapid clogging in areas of water and clay influx into the bed. Local clogging diverted exchanged water laterally, producing clay deposit layers that reduced vertical hyporheic flow and favored horizontal flow. Under gaining conditions, HEF was spatially constrained by upwelling water, which focused clay deposition in a small region on the upstream side of each bed form. Because the area of inflow into the bed was smallest under gaining conditions, local clogging required less clay mass under gaining conditions than neutral or losing conditions. These results indicate that losing and gaining flow conditions need to be considered in assessments of hyporheic exchange, fine particle dynamics in streams, and streambed clogging and restoration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434111700037,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInteractions%2BBetween%2BSuspended%2BKaolinite%2BDeposition%2Band%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BFlux%2BUnder%2BLosing%2Band%2BGaining%2BFlow%2BConditions%26rft.aufirst%3DAryeh%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DFox%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018GL077951%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D4085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4077-4085%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4077%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DFox%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DArnon%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018GL077951,"clay transport,sediment transport,clogging,hyporheic exchange,deposition,stream-groundwater interactions","STREAM-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,PARTICLE DEPOSITION,COLLOID TRANSPORT,NITRATE USE,LOW-ENERGY,SEDIMENT,RIVER,FILTRATION,PATTERNS",,"Ben Gurion Univ Negev, J Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Zuckerberg Inst Water Res, Beer Sheva, Israel"
1,1,"Trauth, N",Sep 2013 ,Coupled 3-D stream flow and hyporheic flow model under varying stream and ambient groundwater flow conditions in a pool-riffle system,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Exchange of water and solutes across the stream-sediment interface is an important control for biogeochemical transformations in the hyporheic zone (HZ). In this paper, we investigate the interplay between turbulent stream flow and HZ flow in pool-riffle streams under various ambient groundwater flow conditions. Streambed pressures, derived from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, are assigned at the top of the groundwater model, and fluxes at the bottom of the groundwater model domain represent losing and gaining conditions. Simulations for different Reynolds numbers (Re) and pool-riffle morphologies are performed. Results show increasing hyporheic exchange flows (m(3)/d) for larger Re and a concurrent decrease in residence time (RT). Losing and gaining conditions were found to significantly affect the hyporheic flow field and diminish its spatial extent as well as rates of hyporheic exchange flow. The fraction of stream water circulating through the hyporheic zone is in the range of 1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-6) per meter stream length, decreasing with increasing discharge. Complex distributions of pressure across the streambed cause significant lateral hyporheic flow components with a mean lateral travel distance of 20% of the longitudinal flow paths length. We found that the relationship between pool-riffle height and hyporheic exchange flow is characterized by a threshold in pool-riffle amplitude, beyond which hyporheic exchange flow becomes independent of riffle height. Hyporheic residence time distributions (RTD) are log-normally distributed with medians ranging between 0.7 and 19 h.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000325991100051,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2B3-D%2Bstream%2Bflow%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bmodel%2Bunder%2Bvarying%2Bstream%2Band%2Bambient%2Bgroundwater%2Bflow%2Bconditions%2Bin%2Ba%2Bpool-riffle%2Bsystem%26rft.aufirst%3DNico%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DTrauth%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20442%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D5850%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5834-5850%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5834%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DTrauth%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DSchmidt%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DFleckenstein%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20442,"hyporheic exchange,computational fluid dynamics,groundwater-surface water exchange,pool-riffle,residence times,undular hydraulic jump","SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,BED FORMS,EXCHANGE PROCESSES,HYDRAULIC JUMPS,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS,RIVERS,ZONE,HETEROGENEITY",,"Helmholtz Ctr Environm Research UFZ, Dept Hydrogeol, Permoserstr 15, DE-04318 Leipzig, Germany"

We show through linked modeling of open channel turbulent flow, groundwater flow, and solute transport that the residence time distributions of solutes advected by hyporheic flow induced by current-bedform interaction follow power-laws. This tailing behavior of solutes exiting the sediments is explained by the presence of multiple path lengths coupled with very large variability in Darcy flow velocity, both occurring without heterogeneity in sediment permeability. Hyporheic exchange through bedforms will result in short-time fractal scaling of stream water chemistry. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

3,3,"Betterle, A",Mar 2021 ,Hyporheic exchange in recirculating flumes under heterogeneous bacterial and morphological conditions,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Hyporheic exchange (HE) contributes to the biogeochemical turnover of macro- and micro-pollutants in rivers. However, the spatiotemporal complexity and variability of HE hinder understanding of its role in the overall functioning of riverine ecosystems. The present study focuses on investigating the role of bacterial diversity and sediment morphology on HE using a multi-flume experiment. A fully coupled surface-subsurface numerical model was used to highlight complex exchange patterns between surface water and the underlying flow field in the sediments. Under the experimental conditions, the surface water flow induced by bedforms has a prominent effect on both local trajectories and residence time distributions of hyporheic flow paths, whereas mean hyporheic retention times are mainly modulated by average surface flowrates. In case of complex bedform morphologies, the numerical model successfully reproduces the HE estimated by means of salt dilution tests. However, the 2D numerical representation of the system falls short in predicting HE in absence of bedforms, highlighting the intrinsic complexity of water circulation patterns in real scenarios. Finally, results show that higher bacterial diversities in the stream sediments can significantly reduce hyporheic fluxes. This work provides a framework to interpret micropollutants turnover in light of the underlying physical transport processes in the hyporheic zone. The study emphasizes the importance of better understanding the tradeoff between physically driven transport processes and bacterial dynamics in the hyporheic zone to quantify the fate of pollutants in streams and rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000629640300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B234%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Brecirculating%2Bflumes%2Bunder%2Bheterogeneous%2Bbacterial%2Band%2Bmorphological%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DAndrea%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DBetterle%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-021-09472-2%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D80%26rft.au%3DBetterle%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DJaeger%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSchirmer%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-021-09472-2,"Hyporheic exchange,Biodegradation,Pollutants,Hyporheic zone,Modelling,Surface water porewater interaction",,,"Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Water Resources & Drinking Water, Dubendorf, Switzerland"

Wells were established beneath the wetted perimeter of the surface stream and beneath exposed alluvial sediments lateral to surface water. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was reduced in the interstitial environment (<50% saturation), but hyporheic water was enriched in nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Time-of-day and location of wells interacted significantly to produce distinct patterns of diel variation in NO3-N and SRP in wells located beneath the wetted perimeter. In lateral wells, NO3-N concentration showed significant spatial variation, but exhibited no significant variation among sampling times within a day. Vertical hydraulic gradient varied from +0.29 to -0.84 over a 90 m study reach and hydraulic heads varied by as much as 9 cm on a diel basis. Concentration and flux of NO3-N was greatest in surface water overlying upwelling regions at night when upwelling heads were greatest. Downstream decreases in NO3-N reflected loss of groundwater discharge into surface water and strong assimilatory demand by surface algal communities. Hydrologically mediated exchange can have strong influence on physical-chemical and biologic conditions in the hyporheic zone, benthic environment and associated surface water.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1993LM01600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSURFACE-HYPORHEIC%2BINTERACTIONS%2BIN%2BA%2BSONORAN%2BDESERT%2BSTREAM%2B-%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BEXCHANGE%2BAND%2BDIEL%2BPERIODICITY%26rft.aufirst%3DHM%26rft.auinit%3DHM%26rft.aulast%3DVALETT%26rft.date%3D1993%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00006593%26rft.epage%3D144%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D133-144%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D133%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D259&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/BF00006593,"DESERT STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,DIEL,VERTICAL HYDRAULIC GRADIENT","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,NUTRIENT DYNAMICS,DIURNAL-VARIATION,MARINE-SEDIMENTS,3RD-ORDER STREAM,WATER,GROUNDWATER,METABOLISM,PATTERNS,DENITRIFICATION",,

A test in a semi-natural and a regulated river,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"River-groundwater exchanges are crucial for several ecological processes, but difficult to localize. Hyporheic oligochaetes may represent efficient biological indicators of these exchanges, but hydrological disturbance may alter oligochaete distribution and blur the spatial patterns of river-groundwater exchanges. Oligochaete assemblages were compared in the Drome River, which is a semi-natural braided river with an unmodified discharge, and the Ain River, which has reduced sediment mobility and hydropeaking due to several upstream dams. In the semi-natural river, the oligochaete distribution was mostly controlled by the origin of the water: some stygoxene species (e.g., Chaetogaster spp. and Vejdovskyella intermedia) were restricted to or more abundant in downwellings, whereas a set of stygophiles (e.g., Stylodrilus sp. and Cernovitoviella sp.) and stygobites (e.g., Aberrantidrilus cuspis) were present or more abundant only in upwellings. Species living in fine sediment (e.g., Potamothrix sp. and Tubifex sp.) also occurred in upwellings due to their location at the border of the braided strip. Conversely, in the regulated river, oligochaete assemblages were abundant and diversified, with species living in fine sediment being dominant in the partially clogged stations. The spatial distribution of most species did not follow typical surface-hyporheic exchange patterns: most stygophiles (e.g., Proppapus volki and Marionina argentea) and some stygobites (e.g., Haber turquini) were found in both upwellings and downwellings or even at stations without water exchanges (e.g., Rhyacodrilus balmensis). In rivers subjected to hydrological disturbance and hydropeaking, oligochaetes became poor indicators of river-groundwater exchanges.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000597224400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAre%2Bhyporheic%2Boligochaetes%2Befficient%2Bindicators%2Bof%2Bhydrological%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Briver%2Bbed%2Bsediment%253F%2BA%2Btest%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsemi-natural%2Band%2Ba%2Bregulated%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DMichel%2BCreuze%26rft.auinit%3DMC%26rft.aulast%3Ddes%2BChatelliers%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.3758%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D407%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D399-407%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D399%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D37%26rft.au%3Ddes%2BChatelliers%252C%2BMC%26rft.au%3DDoledec%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/rra.3758,"aquatic oligochaeta,braided river,ecological indicator,hyporheic zone,invertebrates,meandering river","CO-INERTIA ANALYSIS,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,AIN RIVER,SURFACE,WATER,ASSEMBLAGES,BIODIVERSITY,PATTERNS,FLOW,BIOTURBATION",,"Univ Lyon, Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, ENTPE, UMR 5023,LEHNA,CNRS, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"
6,6,"Boano, F",Jul 2013 ,Modeling hyporheic exchange with unsteady stream discharge and bedform dynamics,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Water exchange between streams and hyporheic zones is highly dynamic, and its temporal variation is related to the hydrologic fluctuations of stream discharge and groundwater levels. Unfortunately, predictions of temporal patterns of exchange are difficult due to the many hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes that are involved and also to their complex nonlinear interactions. Examples of these processes include the evolution of streambed morphology in response to changing streamflow as well as the feedback on surface flow induced by drag resistance due to evolving bed forms. In this work, we have employed a stochastic method to analyze the temporal dynamics of bed form-driven hyporheic exchange in a stream characterized by subcritical flow and daily discharge variations. The method is an extension of previous studies that includes current-induced alterations of bedform size and celerity and their effect on water exchange. The modeling results show that during high flows, stream water penetrates deeper and for longer times in the sediments. At the same time, the predicted rate of water exchange per unit streambed area decreases because the streambed area occupied by each bed form increases faster than the volumetric rate of stream water exchange induced by the same bed form. This reduction can be compensated by the increase in wetted area with discharge, which may provide additional streambed area for water exchange.

8,8,"Hancock, PJ",Jun 2002 ,Human impacts on the stream-groundwater exchange zone,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Active exchanges of water and dissolved material between the stream and groundwater in many porous sand- and gravel-bed rivers create a dynamic ecotone called the hyporheic zone. Because it lies between two heavily exploited freshwater resources-rivers and groundwater-the hyporheic zone is vulnerable to impacts coming to it through both of these habitats, This review focuses on the direct and indirect effects of human activity on ecosystem functions of the hyporheic zone, River regulation, mining, agriculture, urban, and industrial activities all have the potential to impair interstitial bacterial and invertebrate biota and disrupt the hydrological connections between the hyporheic zone and stream, groundwater, riparian, and floodplain ecosystems. Until recently, our scientific ignorance of hyporheic processes has perhaps excused the inclusion of this ecotone in river management policy, However, this no longer is the case as we become increasingly aware of the central role that the hyporheic zone plays in the maintenance of water quality and as a habitat and refuge for fauna. To fully understand the impacts of human activity on the hyporheic zone, river managers need to work with scientists to conduct long-term studies over large stretches of river. River rehabilitation and protection strategies need to prevent the degradation of linkages between the hyporheic zone and surrounding habitats while ensuring that it remains isolated from toxicants. Strategies that prevent anthropogenic restriction of exchanges may include the periodic release of environmental flows to flush silt and reoxygenate sediments, maintenance of riparian buffers, effective land use practices, and suitable groundwater and surface water extraction policies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000175552200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHuman%2Bimpacts%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bstream-groundwater%2Bexchange%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DPJ%26rft.auinit%3DPJ%26rft.aulast%3DHancock%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00267-001-0064-5%26rft.eissn%3D1432-1009%26rft.epage%3D781%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0364-152X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D763-781%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D763%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMANAGE%26rft.volume%3D29&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00267-001-0064-5,"human impacts,hyporheic zone,mining impacts,agricultural impacts,urban impacts,industrial pollution,river regulation,sedimentation,stream restoration,stream management","INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY RESPONSES,SURFACE-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,AQUIFER INTERACTION ZONE,FALL CHINOOK SALMON,HYPORHEIC ZONE,HEAVY-METALS,CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS,BENTHIC COMMUNITIES,BOTTOM SEDIMENTS,WATER CHEMISTRY",,"Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia"
9,9,"Huang, P",Jul 2021 ,Hyporheic Exchange in a Straight Pool-Riffle Stream With Floodplain,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange (HE) is the exchange between surface water, including suspended and dissolved matter, and pore water in the sediment surrounding a stream. It is essential to physicochemical and biological processes in both the stream and the surrounding sediment. This study systematically investigated the effects of the stream characteristics (i.e., stream discharge, bedform amplitude and wavelength, stream bed slope and groundwater flow) on the characteristics of HE (i.e., flowrate, scale, and residence time) in a straight pool-riffle stream with floodplain using laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The HE in the stream bank and streambed and its controlling factors were evaluated using numerical models. The results show that the HE flowrate and volume in the stream banks (i.e., in the floodplain) and streambed are significant and comparable at a high discharge. The discharge, bedform amplitude and bed slope directly affect the flow state in the pool, and the flow state determines the patterns of the effects of these three factors on the HE flowrate. The HE flowrate shows a linear relationship with discharge and bed slope when the surface flow in the pool remains subcritical. If the flow state in the pool changes from subcritical to supercritical conditions as discharge or bed slope increase, the HE flowrate becomes non-monotonic with discharge and it first increases and then decreases with increasing bed slope. The flowrate, scale, and flux-weighted mean residence time of HE linearly increase with bedform wavelength and exponentially decrease with both gaining and losing groundwater flow, independent of discharge.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000680092200038,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR029182%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bin%2Ba%2BStraight%2BPool-Riffle%2BStream%2BWith%2BFloodplain%26rft.aufirst%3DPeng%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DHuang%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR029182%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DChui%252C%2BTFM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR029182,"bedform,floodplain,groundwater flow,hyporheic exchange,pool-riffle","NONSORBING SOLUTES,WATER,FLOW,MODEL",,"Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China"
10,10,"Ward, AS",May 2017 ,Dynamic hyporheic and riparian flow path geometry through base flow recession in two headwater mountain stream corridors,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hydrologic connectivity between streams and their valley bottoms (stream corridor) is a critical determinant of their ecological function. Ecological functions are known to be spatially and temporally variable, but spatial dimensions of the problem are not easily quantified and thus they are usually overlooked. To estimate the spatial patterns of connectivity, and how connectivity varies with changes in discharge, we developed the hyporheic potential model. We used the model to interpret a series of solute tracer injections in two headwater mountain streams with contrasting valley bottom morphologies to estimate connectivity in the stream corridor. The distributions of flow path origination locations and the lengths of hyporheic flow paths appear to vary with base flow recession, even in cases where transport timescales are apparently unchanged. The modeled distribution of origination locations further allowed us to define a spatial analog to the temporal window of detection associated with solute tracer studies, and enables assessment of connectivity dynamics between streams and their corridors. Altogether, the reduced complexity hyporheic potential model provides an easy way to anticipate the spatial distribution and origination locations of hyporheic flow paths from a basic understanding of the valley bottom characteristics and solute transport timescales.Plain Language Summary The manuscript details a simple method to assess the spatial connectivity of streams and their riparian zones. While the timescales of exchange in the river corridor have been broadly studied, the complimentary spatial dimension (i.e., the geometry of exchange flowpaths) remains largely unknown. The major challenge in assessing the spatial dimensions of exchange is the limited information available in the subsurface. Here, we develop a reduced complexity model of valley bottom transport to overcome these information limitations. With this model, relatively simple field site characterization and solute tracer data are combined to assess the spatial distribution of downwelling along a headwater mountain stream. We validate the model with a numerical experiment, and demonstrate its application in two watersheds of contrasting geology, repeated through baseflow recession.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000403712100028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDynamic%2Bhyporheic%2Band%2Briparian%2Bflow%2Bpath%2Bgeometry%2Bthrough%2Bbase%2Bflow%2Brecession%2Bin%2Btwo%2Bheadwater%2Bmountain%2Bstream%2Bcorridors%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019875%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4003%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3988-4003%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3988%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DSchmadel%252C%2BNM%26rft.au%3DSingha%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR019875,"solute transport,solute tracer,riparian,stream corridor,hyporheic,transit time,river corridor","SURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,RIVER CORRIDOR,FREEDOM SPACE,MANAGEMENT,ZONE,MODELS,RESTORATION,MORPHOLOGY",,"Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA"
11,11,"Gooseff, MN",Dec 7 2002 ,Weathering reactions and hyporheic exchange controls on stream water chemistry in a glacial meltwater stream in the McMurdo Dry Valleys,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, dilute glacial meltwater flows down well-established streambeds to closed basin lakes during the austral summer. During the 6-12 week flow season, a hyporheic zone develops in the saturated sediment adjacent to the streams. Longer Dry Valley streams have higher concentrations of major ions than shorter streams. The longitudinal increases in Si and K suggest that primary weathering contributes to the downstream solute increase. The hypothesis that weathering reactions in the hyporheic zone control stream chemistry was tested by modeling the downstream increase in solute concentration in von Guerard Stream in Taylor Valley. The average rates of solute supplied from these sources over the 5.2 km length of the stream were 6.1 x 10(-9) mol Si L-1 m(-1) and 3.7 x 10(-9) mol K L-1 m(-1), yielding annual dissolved Si loads of 0.02-1.30 mol Si m(-2) of watershed land surface. Silicate minerals in streambed sediment were analyzed to determine the representative surface area of minerals in the hyporheic zone subject to primary weathering. Two strategies were evaluated to compute sediment surface area normalized weathering rates. The first applies a best linear fit to synoptic data in order to calculate a constant downstream solute concentration gradient, dC/dx (constant weathering rate contribution, CRC method); the second uses a transient storage model to simulate dC/dx, representing both hyporheic exchange and chemical weathering (hydrologic exchange, HE method). Geometric surface area normalized dissolution rates of the silicate minerals in the stream ranged from 0.6 x 10(-12) mol Si m(-2) s(-1) to 4.5 x 10(-12) mol Si m(-2) s(-1) and 0.4 x 10(-12) mol K m(-2) s(-1) to 1.9 x 10(-12) mol K m(-2) s(-1). These values are an order of magnitude lower than geometric surface area normalized weathering rates determined in laboratory studies and are an order of magnitude greater than geometric surface area normalized weathering rates determined in a warmer, wetter setting in temperate basins, despite the cold temperatures, lack of precipitation and lack of organic material. These results suggest that the continuous saturation and rapid flushing of the sediment due to hyporheic exchange facilitates weathering in Dry Valley streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000181021000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1279%26rft.atitle%3DWeathering%2Breactions%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bstream%2Bwater%2Bchemistry%2Bin%2Ba%2Bglacial%2Bmeltwater%2Bstream%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMcMurdo%2BDry%2BValleys%26rft.aufirst%3DMN%26rft.auinit%3DMN%26rft.aulast%3DGooseff%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2001WR000834%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DBlum%252C%2BAE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2001WR000834,"hyporheic zone,chemical weathering,flow path,Antarctica,stream","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,LAKE FRYXELL BASIN,TRANSIENT STORAGE,VICTORIA LAND,SURFACE-WATER,FLUVIAL GEOCHEMISTRY,EASTERN SIBERIA,TAYLOR VALLEY,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,SOLUTE TRANSPORT",,"Utah State Univ, Dept Aquat Watershed & Earth Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA"
12,12,"Stofleth, JM",Jun 15 2008 ,"Hyporheic and total transient storage in small, sand-bed streams",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Key processes in stream ecosystems are linked to hydraulic retention, which is the departure of stream flow from ideal 'plug flow', and reflects fluid movement through surface and hyporheic storage zones. Most existing information about hyporheic exchange is based on flume studies or field measurements in relatively steep streams with beds coarser than sand. Stream tracer studies may be used to quantify overall hydraulic retention, but disaggregation of surface and hyporheic retention remains difficult. A stream tracer approach was used to compute the rates at which stream water is exchanged with water in storage zones (total storage) in short reaches of two small, sand-bed streams under free and obstructed flow conditions. Tracer curves were fit to the one-dimensional transport with inflow storage model OTIS-P. Networks of piezometers were used to measure specific discharge between the stream and the groundwater. In the sand-bed streams studied, parameters describing total retention were in the upper 50% of data compiled from the literature, most of which represented streams with beds coarser than sand. However, hyporheic storage was an insignificant component of total hydraulic retention, representing only 0.01-0-49% of total exchange, and this fraction did not increase after installation of flow obstructions. Total retention did not vary systematically with bed material size, but increased 50-100% following flow obstruction. Removal of roughness elements, such as large wood and debris dams, is detrimental to processes dependent upon transient storage in small, sand-bed streams.

13,13,"Zaramella, M",Jul 31 2003 ,Application of the transient storage model to analyze advective hyporheic exchange with deep and shallow sediment beds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydrodynamic exchange between a stream and its bed plays an important role in solute transport in rivers. Stream-subsurface exchange is known to occur due to several different mechanisms and different approaches have been used to model the resulting solute transport, but there has been little investigation of the ability of the various models to represent specific exchange processes. This work evaluates the ability of the semiempirical transient storage model (TSM) to represent advective hyporheic exchange driven by bed form-induced pore water flows. The TSM is based on the idealized hypothesis that the flux of contaminants is proportional to the difference in concentration between the bed and the stream. To evaluate the ability of this simplified mass transfer relationship to reproduce advective hyporheic exchange, we apply the TSM to data sets for the exchange of conservative solutes with sand beds in laboratory flumes where bed form-induced pumping is the dominant exchange mechanism. The results show that the simplified expressions used in the TSM can represent some but not all aspects of the pumping process. The TSM can represent advective exchange with shallow beds that have a defined exchange layer restricted by the presence of an impermeable boundary. In this case, transient storage parameters can be directly related to the streamflow conditions and the channel geometry. However, the TSM does not do a good job of representing exchange with a relatively deep sediment bed, where flow along different advective paths in the bed yields a wide distribution of exchange timescales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000184712200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1198%26rft.atitle%3DApplication%2Bof%2Bthe%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bmodel%2Bto%2Banalyze%2Badvective%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bwith%2Bdeep%2Band%2Bshallow%2Bsediment%2Bbeds%26rft.aufirst%3DM%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DZaramella%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2002WR001344%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DZaramella%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DMarion%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2002WR001344,"hyporheic exchange,transient storage,solute transport,streams,stream-subsurface interactions,modeling","STREAM-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,WATER EXCHANGE,TRACER,RIVERS,FORMS,GROUNDWATER",,"Univ Padua, Dept Hydraul Maritime & Geotech Engn, Via Loredan 20, I-35100 Padua, Italy"
14,14,"Roche, KR",Feb 2019 ,Modeling Benthic Versus Hyporheic Nutrient Uptake in Unshaded Streams With Varying Substrates,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Assessments of riverine ecosystem health and water quality require knowledge of how headwater streams transport and transform nutrients. Estimates of nutrient demand at the watershed scale are commonly inferred from reach-scale solute injections, which are typically reported as uptake velocities (v(f)). Multiple interacting processes control v(f), making it challenging to predict how v(f) responds to physical changes in the stream. In this study, we link v(f) to a continuous time random walk model to quantify how v(f) is controlled by in-stream (velocity, dispersion, and benthic reaction) and hyporheic processes (exchange rate, residence times, and hyporheic reaction). We fit the model to conservative (NaCl) and nitrate (NO3--N) pulse tracer injections in unshaded replicate streams at the Notre Dame Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility, which differed only in substrate size and distribution. Experiments were conducted over the first 25days of biofilm colonization to examine how the interaction between substrate type and biofilm growth influenced modeled processes and v(f). Model fits of benthic reaction rates were approximate to 8x greater than hyporheic reaction rates for all experiments and did not vary with substrate type or over time. High benthic reactivity was associated with filamentous green algae coverage on the streambed, which dominated total algal biomass. Finally, v(f) was most sensitive to benthic reaction rate and stream velocity, and sensitivity varied with stream conditions due to its nonlinear dependence on all modeled processes. Together, these results demonstrate how reach-scale nutrient demand reflects the relative contributions of biotic and abiotic processes in the benthic layer and the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000460859100012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2BBenthic%2BVersus%2BHyporheic%2BNutrient%2BUptake%2Bin%2BUnshaded%2BStreams%2BWith%2BVarying%2BSubstrates%26rft.aufirst%3DKevin%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DKR%26rft.aulast%3DRoche%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018JG004684%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D383%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D367-383%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D367%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D124%26rft.au%3DRoche%252C%2BKR%26rft.au%3DShogren%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DBolster%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018JG004684,"stream,nutrient,hyporheic exchange,CTRW,nitrate,solute","REACTIVE TRACER TESTS,TRANSIENT STORAGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,NITROGEN REMOVAL,NITRATE,DENITRIFICATION,DYNAMICS,EXPORT,SIMULATION,BIOFILMS",,"Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA"
15,15,"Chow, R",Jul 2021 ,How Do Fractures Influence Hyporheic Exchange in Sedimentary Rock Riverbeds?,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bedrock rivers represent a hydrogeological environment in which surface water flows along an exposed bedrock surface. Studies of hyporheic exchange have exclusively involved rivers composed of unconsolidated fluvial sediments, leaving a critical knowledge gap. This study evaluates the conditions that could support bedform-scale hyporheic exchange within a fractured sedimentary bedrock river based on field data collected near Guelph, Canada. Hyporheic exchange at the bedform-scale was evaluated by numerically modeling the migration of a conservative solute tracer through a bedrock riverbed within a two-dimensional vertical cross-section along the flow direction. A stochastic discrete fracture-matrix framework was developed to represent measured subsurface fractured bedrock properties, producing a probabilistic distribution of potential hyporheic exchange pathways. Flow and transport model results indicate that: (a) bedform-scale hyporheic exchange within a bedrock river exists with high fluid flow velocities in fractures, yet long solute residence times due to diffusion across the fracture-matrix boundary; (b) the coincidence of fractures and hydrodynamic head gradients across the riverbed controls the spatial extent of bedform-scale hyporheic exchange; and (c) the potential variability in hyporheic exchange residence time is large (i.e., tens of years) due to the inherent variability in facture network properties. Our field-based numerical study indicates that the average (median) residence time may not be a good proxy for the potential natural attenuation capacity of a fractured sedimentary bedrock riverbed and that hyporheic exchange has the potential to emplace surface water contaminants within the fractured porous rock matrix that could become a long-term source of trace contaminants.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000680092200049,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028476%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2BDo%2BFractures%2BInfluence%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bin%2BSedimentary%2BRock%2BRiverbeds%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DR.%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DChow%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028476%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DChow%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DParker%252C%2BBL%26rft.au%3DNowak%252C%2BW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR028476,"hyporheic exchange,bedrock river,stochastic framework,dual porosity,fracture connectivity","SILURIAN DOLOMITE,WATER INTERACTION,BEDROCK,FLOW,TEMPERATURE,TRANSPORT,MECHANICS,NETWORK",,"Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Stellenbosch, South Africa"
16,16,"Kasahara, T",Oct 2007 ,Instream restoration: Its effects on lateral stream-subsurface water exchange in urban and agricultural streams in Southern Ontario,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Instream restoration strategies do not generally consider the subsurface environment. The study of recently restored stream reaches can provide an opportunity to assess the impacts of restoration on surface-subsurface exchange. In this study, lateral hyporheic zones occurring in a constructed gravel bar and re-meandered stream reach were examined, using hydrometric data in combination with differences in background conservative ion and tracer injection experiments. Both the constructed gravel bar and the meander bends induced lateral hyporheic exchange flow. In the gravel bar, lateral hyporheic exchange increased after a riffle-pool sequence was constructed in the channel adjacent to the bar. The substrate in the meander bends had low saturated hydraulic conductivity, and the stream-subsurface exchange was limited despite the large change in channel configuration. These results suggest that to enhance and maintain stream-subsurface water exchanges, restoration projects that modify horizontal geometry should involve construction of vertical morphologic features, and where floodplain sediments are fine-grained, the addition of coarse sediments should also be incorporated in the design.

17,17,"Wondzell, SM",Feb 15 2006 ,"Effect of morphology and discharge on hyporheic exchange flows in two small streams in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream-tracer injections were used to examine the effect of channel morphology and changing stream discharge on hyporheic exchange flows. Direct observations were made from well networks to follow tracer movement through the hyporheic zone. The reach-integrated influence of hyporheic exchange was evaluated using the transient storage model (TSM) OTIS-P. Transient storage modelling results were compared with direct observations to evaluate the reliability of the TSM. Results from the tracer injection in the bedrock reach supported the assumption that most transient storage in headwater mountain streams results from hyporheic exchange. Direct observations from the well networks in colluvial reaches showed that subsurface flow paths tended to parallel the valley axis. Cross-valley gradients were weak except near steps, where vertical and cross-valley hydraulic gradients indicated a strong potential for stream water to downwell into the hyporheic zone. The TSM parameters showed that both size and residence time of transient storage were greater in reaches with a few large log-jam-formed steps than in reaches with more frequent, but smaller steps. Direct observations showed that residence times in the unconstrained stream were longer than in the constrained stream and that little change occurred in the location and extent of the hyporheic zone between low- and high-baseflow discharges in any of the colluvial reaches. The transient storage modelling results did not agree with these observations, suggesting that the TSM was insensitive to long residence-time exchange flows and was very sensitive to changes in discharge. Disagreements between direct observations and the transient storage modelling results highlight fundamental problems with the TSM that confound comparisons between the transient storage modelling results for tracer injections conducted under differing flow conditions. Overall, the results showed that hyporheic exchange was little affected by stream discharge (at least over the range of baseflow discharges examined in this study). The results did show that channel morphology controlled development of the hyporheic zone in these steep mountain stream channels.

The objective of this study was to evaluate two important factors in the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the hyporheic zone: a considerable change in water flow conditions and various origins of riverbed sections, natural and artificial. To identify the spatial variation of the hydraulic gradient in the hyporheic zone of the river, a gradientmeter was applied. The measurements show that at low water stages, upwelling was dominant, with an evidently inactive zone, whereas downwelling was inconsiderable. However, the morphology of the riverbed changed during the flood flow, and downwelling clearly dominated. Upwelling zones retained their activity despite a major change in hydrological conditions. Present studies on the artificially dug Moszczenica Canal have documented outflow of water from an artificial medieval canal to a naturally formed drainage base. This means that despite the passage of hundreds of years, the natural drainage base of the Moszczenica River is still active. Studies have demonstrated the applicability of the gradientmeter for evaluating the interaction between surface and groundwaters in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000844942100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVARIABILITY%2BOF%2BWATER%2BEXCHANGE%2BIN%2BTHE%2BHYPORHEIC%2BZONE%2BOF%2BA%2BLOWLAND%2BRIVER%2BIN%2BPOLAND%2BBASED%2BON%2BGRADIENTOMETRIC%2BSTUDIES%26rft.aufirst%3DMarek%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DMarciniak%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2478%252Fquageo-2022-0030%26rft.eissn%3D2081-6383%26rft.epage%3D156%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0137-477X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DQUAESTIONES%2BGEOGRAPHICAE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D141-156%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D141%26rft.stitle%3DQUAEST%2BGEOGR%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DMarciniak%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DZiulkiewicz%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DGorecki%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=QUAESTIONES+GEOGRAPHICAE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2478/quageo-2022-0030,"groundwater-river water interactions,hyporheic zone,gradientmeter,Moszczenica River,Poland","GROUNDWATER INTERACTIONS,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,STREAM,INTERFACE,DYNAMICS,ECOLOGY",,"Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Hydrometry Res Unit, Inst Phys Geog & Environm Planning, Poznan, Poland"
19,19,"Shrivastava, S",Feb 2021 ,Influence of Bioturbation on Hyporheic Exchange in Streams: Conceptual Model and Insights From Laboratory Experiments,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bioturbation occurs in streambeds by the action of a range of faunal species, but little is known about how it could modify the hyporheic exchange in streams. Previous experimental work investigating the effects of sediment-biota interaction on exchange across the sediment-water interface has been largely conducted in small mesocosms or infiltration columns that do not represent the lotic environment adequately. Therefore, the experimental findings from these studies may not be transferable to flowing water environments (e.g., streams). In this work, we first present a conceptual model demonstrating the causal pathways through which the sediment reworking and burrow ventilation processes (together referred to as bioturbation) could potentially modify the hyporheic flow regime. Next, to study the role of activities of faunal organisms in lotic environments and test some of the arguments presented in the model, laboratory experiments are conducted in re-circulating flumes. The experiments involved investigating the modification of dune-induced hyporheic flow due to the activities of a model bioturbating organism, Lumbriculus variegatus, following a control (without organisms) and treatment (with organisms) based experimental design. The sediment reworking activities such as surficial deposition of fecal pellets and burrowing by L. variegatus caused significantly higher hyporheic flux, longer mean residence times, and deeper solute penetration in the treatment flumes relative to the control flumes. We advocate that more intensive laboratory experiments and field investigations must be conducted to test the propositions put forward in the conceptual model and advance our understanding of the role of bioturbation process in fluvial ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000624603200058,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028468%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2BBioturbation%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bin%2BStreams%253A%2BConceptual%2BModel%2Band%2BInsights%2BFrom%2BLaboratory%2BExperiments%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DShrivastava%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028468%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DShrivastava%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DStewardson%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DArora%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR028468,"bioturbation,hyporheic exchange,lotic environment",,,"Univ Melbourne, Environm Hydrol & Water Resources Grp, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia"
20,20,"Hall, RO",Jan 2020 ,Gas exchange in streams and rivers,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Gas exchange across the air-water boundary of streams and rivers is a globally large biogeochemical flux. Gas exchange depends on the solubility of the gas of interest, the gas concentrations of the air and water, and the gas exchange velocity (k), usually normalized to a Schmidt number of 600, referred to as k(600). Gas exchange velocity is of intense research interest because it is problematic to estimate, is highly spatially variable, and has high prediction error. Theory dictates that molecular diffusivity and turbulence drives variation in k(600) in flowing waters. We measure k(600) via several methods from direct measures, gas tracer experiments, to modeling of diel changes in dissolved gas concentrations. Many estimates of k(600) show that surface turbulence explains variation in k(600) leading to predictive models based upon geomorphic and hydraulic variables. These variables include stream channel slope and stream flow velocity, the product of which, is proportional to the energy dissipation rate in streams and rivers. These empirical models provide understanding of the controls on k(600), yet high residual variation in k(600) show that these simple models are insufficient for predicting individual locations. The most appropriate method to estimate gas exchange depends on the scientific question along with the characteristics of the study sites. We provide a decision tree for selecting the best method to estimate k(600) for individual river reaches to scaling to river networks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000491657200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be1391%26rft.atitle%3DGas%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BO.%26rft.auinit%3DRO%26rft.aulast%3DHall%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwat2.1391%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2049-1948%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWILEY%2BINTERDISCIPLINARY%2BREVIEWS-WATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWIRES%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO%26rft.au%3DUlseth%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WILEY+INTERDISCIPLINARY+REVIEWS-WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wat2.1391,"energy dissipation rate,gas exchange,gas tracer experiments,hydraulics,k(600),river metabolism,rivers,scaling,streams","MACROPHYTE RICH STREAMS,CARBON-DIOXIDE,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,TRANSFER VELOCITIES,TRACER MEASUREMENT,CO2 EVASION,REAERATION,WATER,RATES,AIR",,"Univ Montana, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Polson, MT 59860 USA"
21,21,"Larson, LN",Sep 25 2013 ,Hydrogeochemical niches associated with hyporheic exchange beneath an acid mine drainage-contaminated stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Biological low-pH Fe(II)-oxidation creates terraced iron formations (TIFs) that remove Fe(III) from solution. TIFs can be used for remediation of acid mine drainage (AMD), however, as sediment depth increases, Fe(III)-reduction in anoxic subsurface areas may compromise treatment effectiveness. In this study we used near-surface electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) and in situ pore-water samplers to spatially resolve bulk conductivity changes within a TIF formed in a stream emanating from a large abandoned deep clay mine in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, USA. Because of the high fluid electrical conductivity of the emergent AMD (1860 mu S), fresh water (42 mu S) was added as a dilution tracer to visualize the spatial and temporal extent of hyporheic exchange and to characterize subsurface flow paths. Distinct hydrogeochemical niches were identified in the shallow subsurface beneath the stream by overlaying relative groundwater velocities (derived from ERI) with pore-water chemistry profiles. Niches were classified based on relatively ""fast"" versus ""slow"" rates of hyporheic exchange and oxic versus anoxic conditions. Pore-water concentrations and speciation of iron, pH, and redox potential differed between subsurface flow regimes. The greatest extent of hyporheic exchange was beneath the center of the stream, where a shallower (<10 cm) Fe(II)-oxidizing zone was observed. Meanwhile, less hyporheic exchange was observed near the channel banks, concurrent with a more pronounced, deeper (>70 cm) Fe(II)-oxidizing zone. At these locations, relatively slower groundwater exchange may promote biotic Fe(II)-oxidation and improve the long-term stability of Fe sequestered in TIFs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

22,22,"Liu, DS",Dec 2020 ,Hyporheic exchange mechanism driven by flood wave,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"To study the hyporheic exchange driven by a single peak flood-induced water level fluctuation (i.e., flood wave), a method combining numerical simulation with theoretical derivation was proposed based on the Inbuk Stream, Korea, where flooding occurs frequently. The hyporheic exchanges induced by different flood waves were investigated by varying amplitude (A), duration (T), wave type parameter (r), and rising duration (t(p)), which were adopted from the real-time stream stage fluctuations. Additionally, the idea of constant upstream flood volume (CUFV) condition for flood waves was put forward, and the effects of ""Botan"" (T/A) and peak number (N) on hyporheic exchange were studied. The results showed that the hyporheic exchange flux (q) was controlled by the water level h (sine-type) and its change rate v (cosine-type), and was proportional to the polynomial of them q proportional to (omega center dot h + v), where omega is the angular frequency of the flood wave. Based on this mechanism, the influence principles on hyporheic exchanges of the typical flood wave parameters (A, T, r and t(p)) as well as T/A and N under CUFV condition were clarified. The main characteristic variables of hyporheic exchange, which were maximum aquifer storage and residence time, were positively correlated. They also had positive relations to the integral of the flood wave over time, which increased when the wave became higher, wider, rounder and less skewed. However, when CUFV condition was imposed, the residence time was positively correlated with T/A, whereas the maximum aquifer storage was negatively correlated with T/A. With the increase in N, water exchanged more frequently and some water returned to the stream early, leading to the slight decrease in maximum aquifer storage and residence time. These findings enriched the theory of hyporheic exchange driven by surface water fluctuation and be of great significance to enhance pollutant degradation in the hyporheic zone downstream of reservoirs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000583224600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bmechanism%2Bdriven%2Bby%2Bflood%2Bwave%26rft.aufirst%3DDongsheng%26rft.auinit%3DDS%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13956%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D5440%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D26%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5429-5440%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5429%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BDS%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BQH%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BJY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.13956,"flood wave,hyporheic exchange,numerical simulation,theoretical derivation","WATER INFILTRATION,BANK STORAGE,RIVER STAGE,ZONE,AQUIFER,DENITRIFICATION,DISCHARGE,FLUCTUATIONS,PERSPECTIVES,ECOSYSTEMS",,"Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China"
23,23,"Kaser, DH",May 2013 ,ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING CHANNEL MICROFORMS IN GROUNDWATER MODELS OF HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The infiltration of stream water in the sediment and its return to the streama process known here as hyporheic exchange flows (HEF)is a critical control of the structure and functions of the stream ecosystem. River restoration programmes will increasingly require quantitative methods for evaluating this influence. Previous studies have already shown the potential of numerical groundwater models to characterize HEF and compare restoration scenarios. Although various sources of uncertainty are acknowledged, the potential effect of small streambed structures (or microforms), such as grains or ripples, embedded in channel-unit scale structures (or macroforms), such as riffle-pool sequences, is commonly ignored. Here, a simple conceptualization through a 2-D vertical model is used to test whether (i) ignoring microforms in groundwater models at the macroform scale can impact estimations of residence times; (ii) microforms can influence HEF patterns driven by macroforms; and conversely (iii) the uncertainty of head measurements in stream piezometers can affect our understanding of HEF patterns. Results show that (i) residence times and flux estimations can be strongly affected by the modeller's choice to represent microform-induced HEF or not; (ii) the interaction of the microform and macroform scales can induce various subsurface flow patterns; and (iii) the perceived significance of microform-induced HEF is highly sensitive to the uncertainty of in-stream measurements of subsurface heads. Little is known about the relative efficiency of these microform and macroform scales, which are effectively influencing exchange at different depths and interacting with each other. Future studies that consider biogeochemical cycling or streambed ecology should be placed in this context. It is also necessary to find ways of including this source of uncertainty in groundwater models of HEF.

However, the impact of different metal pollution levels and hyporheic exchange on the microbial communities are still unclear. In this study, we further explored the effects of different degrees of heavy metals pollution and the strength of hyporheic exchange on the structures and functions of microbial community in hyporheic zone sediment ecosystem. Sediments were collected from the Weihe River to determine the concentrations of heavy metals, grain size distribution, and hydraulic conductivity, and the microbial information were obtained by eDNA technology. The comprehensive pollution status of the study area was at the slight and moderate level. The hydraulic conductivity (Kv) varied between 0.20 and 3.65 (m/d). The microbial community structures had complex temporal and spatial heterogeneity. The microbial molecular ecological network had modular characteristics and significant differences in different periods (p < 0.05). Metabolic functional genes in microbial communities had the highest relative abundance. In particular, there is a significant negative correlation between heavy metals and microorganisms (p < 0.05), with Cu and Zn contributing the most to microbial community changes (p < 0.05). Moreover, grain size had a significant impact on microorganisms, heavy metals and grain size significantly affect the predictive functions of microbial communities.

25,25,"Hester, ET",May 2018 ,Comparing reach scale hyporheic exchange and denitrification induced by instream restoration structures and natural streambed morphology,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Excess nutrients commonly lead to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. Stream restoration is increasingly popular for nutrient removal enhancing exchange with the reactive hyporheic zone. Hyporheic reactions such as denitrification are often transport-limited and instream restoration structures have been proposed to enhance hyporheic exchange and nutrient removal. However, the comparative effects of instream structure types and watershed setting (i.e. environmental characteristics such as sediment hydraulic conductivity, stream slope) are still poorly understood. Here we used MIKE SHE to model groundwater and surface water interaction and nitrate removal (denitrification) in a 200 m second order stream reach. We simulated various in-stream structures (channel-spanning weirs, partially spanning structures such as cross veins, buried structures) and investigated the effect of controlling environmental characteristics that vary with watershed setting. We found that the environmental characteristics had the greatest effect on surface water-groundwater exchange and therefore denitrification, including streambed hydraulic conductivity, natural or background stream topography and slope, and groundwater levels. Type and number of instream structures also influenced surface water-groundwater exchange and denitrification, but to a lesser degree. Human effects at the watershed scale from agriculture and urbanization likely play a role in whether reach-scale restoration practices succeed in achieving water quality goals both through effect on exchange itself (e.g., altering bed sediment texture) and on nitrate sources. More broadly, restoration efforts at the watershed scale itself, such as reducing fertilizer use or improving stormwater management, may be necessary to achieve ambitious water quality goals. Nevertheless, reach-scale restoration efforts such as in-stream structures may play a useful role in certain watershed settings, for example where groundwater conditions induce neither strong gaining nor strong losing conditions. The interaction of reachscale modifications and watershed setting must be understood to optimize nutrient removal from stream restoration through enhanced hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000427580600012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DComparing%2Breach%2Bscale%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bdenitrification%2Binduced%2Bby%2Binstream%2Brestoration%2Bstructures%2Band%2Bnatural%2Bstreambed%2Bmorphology%26rft.aufirst%3DErich%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecoleng.2018.01.011%26rft.eissn%3D1872-6992%26rft.epage%3D121%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0925-8574%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D105-121%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D105%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D115%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DBrooks%252C%2BKE%26rft.au%3DScott%252C%2BDT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.01.011,"Surface water,groundwater exchange,Hyporheic,Stream restoration,River restoration,Instream structures,Buried structures,Denitrification","GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,RIVER RESTORATION,INSET FLOODPLAINS,NITRATE REMOVAL,BED FORMS,WATER,ZONE,FLOW,NITROGEN,HETEROGENEITY",,"Virginia Polytech & State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 220-D Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
26,26,"Fox, A",Sep 2016 ,The effect of losing and gaining flow conditions on hyporheic exchange in heterogeneous streambeds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bed form-induced hyporheic exchange flux (q(H)) is increasingly viewed as a key process controlling water fluxes and biogeochemical processes in river networks. Despite the fact that streambeds are inherently heterogeneous, the majority of bed form flume-scale studies were done on homogeneous systems. We conducted salt and dye tracer experiments to study the effects of losing and gaining flow conditions on q(H) using a laboratory recirculating flume system packed with a heterogeneous streambed, and equipped with a drainage system that enabled us to apply losing or gaining fluxes. We found that when either losing or gaining fluxes increased (regardless of whether the flux was upward or downward), q(H) followed an exponential decline, the volume of the hyporheic flow cell drastically reduced, and the mean residence times declined moderately. A numerical flow model for the heterogeneous streambed was set up and fitted against the experimental data in order to test whether an equivalent homogeneous case exists. The measured q(H) were accurately predicted with the heterogeneous model, while it was underestimated using a homogeneous model characterized by the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity. It was also shown that in order to produce the results of the heterogeneous model with an equivalent hydraulic conductivity, the latter had to be increased as the losing or gaining fluxes increase. The results strongly suggest that it is critical to adequately account for the heterogeneous streambed structure in order to accurately predict the effect of vertical exchange fluxes between the stream and groundwater on hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000386977900042,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Beffect%2Bof%2Blosing%2Band%2Bgaining%2Bflow%2Bconditions%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bheterogeneous%2Bstreambeds%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DFox%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR018677%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7477%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7460-7477%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7460%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DFox%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DLaube%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DArnon%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR018677,"hyporheic exchange flux,heterogeneous streambeds,stream-aquifer interaction,losing stream,gaining stream","RIFFLE-POOL SEQUENCE,SAND-BED STREAM,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,ALLUVIAL AQUIFERS,SPATIAL-PATTERNS,WATER INTERFACE,POROUS-MEDIA,LOW-ENERGY,RIVER",,"Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Zuckerberg Inst Water Res, IL-84993 Sede Boqer, Israel"
27,27,"Fabian, MW",May 15 2011 ,"Seasonal variation in cascade-driven hyporheic exchange, northern Honduras",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"A characterization of hyporheic exchange for dry and wet season baseflow, as well as partially dewatered discharge, was done in Prieta Creek, a first-order cascade in northern Honduras. The cascade had discharges from 1 to 15 1 s(-1), had average slopes of 12%, pool spacing of 3 m, and shallow substrate of sand and gravel. Tracer tests were conducted in a 15-m sub-reach, a length considered to be adequate for the experiment based on the DaI test, a ratio of exchange and transport processes. In the three tests, between 9 and 18% of tracer was not recovered, possibly due to entrainment in flowpaths passing beneath the downstream monitoring location. Tracer data were analysed by the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) transient storage model (TSM) to derive standard exchange parameters, and by the solute transport in rivers (STIR) model to examine hyporheic residence time distributions (RTDs). The best fit of the observed tracer breakthrough curves was obtained by using the STIR model with a combination of two exponential RTDs to represent hyporheic retention. With increasing discharge, the OTIS model predicted increasing storage exchange fluxes and exchange coefficients and decreasing storage zone areas and transient storage times, which are trends supported by riparian and streambed piezometric head data. Riparian water levels rose during the transition from the dry to wet season, which could constrict the hyporheic storage zone. Thirteen of the 19 streambed piezometers recorded seasonal changes in hydraulic gradients and flux direction, with fewer yet stronger upwelling zones during higher discharges. The MODFLOW model missed the observed seasonal changes, possibly due to subtle changes in the seasonal change in water surface profiles. We conclude that partially dewatered dry season exchange, compared to wet season exchange, was initiated and terminated with smaller pressure gradients and, in different streambed locations, was smaller in volume, had longer residence times, and may connect with deeper and longer flow paths.

29,29,"Boulton, AJ",Jul 2007 ,Hyporheic invertebrate community composition in streams of varying salinity in southwestern Australia: Diversity peaks at intermediate thresholds,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Man), streams of southwestern Australia have become secondarily saline through land clearance and other human activities in their catchments. Elevated salinities impact on aquatic biota and ecological processes of surface streams but little is known of the effects on the diversity and community composition of hyporheic (subsurface) invertebrates occupying the saturated sediments where surface and groundwaters exchange. We hypothesized that biodiversity of hyporheic invertebrates would decline with increasing salinity, especially where saline groundwater upwelled into the surface stream. We also predicted changes in community composition associated with salinity and direction of vertical hydrological exchange. Water and hyporheic invertebrates were sampled from downwelling and upwelling zones of 13 streams in southwestern Australia ranging in median surface water salinity from 0.27 to 17.86 g L-1. Overall, taxa richness of hyporheic invertebrates was uncorrelated with salinity but. surprisingly, correlated positively with the salinity of upwelling water. However, when the sites were divided into 'fresh' (<3 g L-1) and 'mesosaline' (<3 g L-1) groups, this relationship became non-significant. Instead, taxa richness and total abundance were correlated positively with salinity of downwelling water in fresh sites and negatively in mesosaline sites, resulting in a peak in richness at intermediate salinities. Community composition was unrelated to direction of hydrological exchange but was strongly associated with hyporheic salinity. Hyporheic assemblages of 'fresh' rivers were typified by harpacticoid copepods and candoniid ostracods, whereas the amphipod Austrochiltonia and several dipteran groups were more common below 'mesosaline' rivers. Although many hyporheic taxa collected in this study apparently have broad tolerances to salinity, secondary salinization due to human activities potentially changed community composition, possibly altering rates of ecological processes such as organic matter breakdown occurring within the sediments of streams undergoing salinization.

A three-dimensional numerical model of a natural in-stream gravel bar (20 m x 6 m) is presented. Multiple steady state streamflow is simulated with a computational fluid dynamics code that is sequentially coupled to a reactive transport groundwater model via the hydraulic head distribution at the streambed. Ambient groundwater flow is considered by scenarios of neutral, gaining, and losing conditions. The transformation of oxygen, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon by aerobic respiration and denitrification in the hyporheic zone are modeled, as is the denitrification of groundwater-borne nitrate when mixed with stream-sourced carbon. In contrast to fully submerged structures, hyporheic exchange flux decreases with increasing stream discharge, due to decreasing hydraulic head gradients across the partially submerged structure. Hyporheic residence time distributions are skewed in the log-space with medians of up to 8 h and shift to symmetric distributions with increasing level of submergence. Solute turnover is mainly controlled by residence times and the extent of the hyporheic exchange flow, which defines the potential reaction area. Although streamflow is the primary driver of hyporheic exchange, its impact on hyporheic exchange flux, residence times, and solute turnover is small, as these quantities exponentially decrease under losing and gaining conditions. Hence, highest reaction potential exists under neutral conditions, when the capacity for denitrification in the partially submerged structure can be orders of magnitude higher than in fully submerged structures.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000354733500022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydraulic%2Bcontrols%2Bof%2Bin-stream%2Bgravel%2Bbar%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Breactions%26rft.aufirst%3DNico%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DTrauth%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR015857%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2263%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2243-2263%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2243%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DTrauth%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DSchmidt%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DFleckenstein%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014WR015857,"in-stream gravel bar,groundwater-surface water interaction,aerobic respiration,denitrification,computational fluid dynamics,reactive transport model","SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,NONSORBING SOLUTES,FLUVIAL ISLAND,GROUNDWATER,ZONE,DENITRIFICATION,TRANSPORT,RIVER,FLOW",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Hydrogeol, Leipzig, Germany"

We investigated how cobble clusters embedded in a finer-grained sand bed affect the near-bed channel flow and the exchange of surface and subsurface water. We tested how the spacing and embeddedness of cobbles altered hyporheic exchange through a three-dimensional fully coupled surface-subsurface model. The 3D modeling framework captured the full physics of the exchange process locating the lateral position of upwelling zones on the side of the cobble. As the cobbles protrude more into the channel, eddies appear downstream, with smaller vortices where cobbles are closer together. In our simulations, hyporheic exchange increased with the spacing and protrusion ratio. The travel time in the hyporheic zone also increased with the protrusion ratio because the hyporheic flow paths are longer when the cobble is more protruded. With different spacings at the highest protrusion ratio, the average slope of early time breakthrough curve was steeper for large spacing settings: the travel time increases as the spacing decreases.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000751310200046,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030164%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BExchange%2BDue%2Bto%2BCobbles%2Bon%2BSandy%2BBeds%26rft.aufirst%3DAnzy%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DLee%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030164%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DAubeneau%252C%2BAF%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BXF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR030164,"cobble clusters,hyporheic exchange","LARGE WOODY DEBRIS,BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES,SEDIMENT TRANSPORT,RESIDENCE TIMES,FLOW,HABITAT,ZONE,DENITRIFICATION,RESTORATION,HYDRAULICS",,"Utah State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Logan, UT 84322 USA"

This water exchange is generally explained by pressure gradients on the riverbed that are induced by fluvial geomorphological features or by turbulent coherent structures. In this work we discuss a different exchange mechanism due to density gradients between the in-stream and the hyporheic water. We present laboratory results that show how weak density gradients are able to induce significant hyporheic fluxes.

The hyporheic zone connects the stream to uplands and other terrestrial environments. It is a zone of distinct faunal communities, high biological diversity and ecological complexity, and is the site of chemical processing and transformations of ground- and stream waters. The hyporheic zone is important to the overall ecosystem ecology of the stream, and it can influence stream water chemistry. Flows, reactions, and biota in the hyporheic zone are heterogeneous and patchy, making it difficult to clearly describe the ecotone in a straightforward, general way. Nitrogen processing, especially denitrification, appears to be widespread in the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone, as with most aquatic systems, is often impacted by human activities. Stream restorations rarely consider potential effects on the hyporheic zone, but careful project choices can enhance the condition of the hyporheic zone, and so increase uptake of nitrogen by stream-associated environments as partial mitigation of continuing and increasing releases of reactive nitrogen, potentially reaping short-term benefits to estuarine environments that may not be as quickly realized from source control measures.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000341816800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BReview%2Bof%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%252C%2BStream%2BRestoration%252C%2Band%2BMeans%2Bto%2BEnhance%2BDenitrification%26rft.aufirst%3DLeanne%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DMerill%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F10643389.2013.829769%26rft.eissn%3D1547-6537%26rft.epage%3D2379%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1064-3389%26rft.issue%3D21%26rft.jtitle%3DCRITICAL%2BREVIEWS%2BIN%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2337-2379%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2337%26rft.stitle%3DCRIT%2BREV%2BENV%2BSCI%2BTEC%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DMerill%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DTonjes%252C%2BDJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=CRITICAL+REVIEWS+IN+ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/10643389.2013.829769,"hyporheic zone,stream restoration,denitrification,groundwater-surface water interactions","SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,GRAVEL-BED STREAM,SURFACE-WATER,TRANSIENT STORAGE,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,RIPARIAN ZONE,LAND-USE,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,RIVER RESTORATION,ECOLOGICAL THEORY",,"SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA"
34,34,"Lautz, LK",Oct 15 2010 ,Heat tracing of heterogeneous hyporheic exchange adjacent to in-stream geomorphic features,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"There are many field techniques used to quantify rates of hyporheic exchange, which can vary in magnitude and direction spatially over distances of only a few metres, both within and between morphological features. We used in-stream mini-piezometers and heat transport modelling of stream and streambed temperatures to quantify the rates and directions of water flux across the streambed interface upstream and downstream of three types of in-stream geomorphic features: a permanent dam, a beaver dam remnant and a stream meander. We derived hyporheic flux estimates at three different depths at six different sites for a month and then paired those flux rates with measurements of gradient to derive hydraulic conductivity (K) of the streambed sediments. Heat transport modelling provided consistent daily flux estimates that were in agreement directionally with hydraulic gradient measurements and also identified vertical heterogeneities in hydraulic conductivity that led to variable hyporheic exchange. Streambed K varied over an order of magnitude (1.9 x 10(-6) to 5.7 d 10(-5) m/s). Average rates of hyporheic flux ranged from static (q < +/- 0.02 m/day) to 0.42 m/day. Heat transport modelling results suggest three kinds of flow around the dams and the meander.

35,35,"Yuan, Y",Jun 2021 ,Hyporheic Exchange Driven by Submerged Rigid Vegetation: A Modeling Study,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Flow-vegetation interaction affects fluid flow hydraulics and associated material transport in river corridors. Concomitant changes in pressure within the flow field due to the presence of vegetation may act as a driver for the formation of hyporheic flow across the sediment-water interface. This potentially important process, however, has yet to be studied. In order to investigate vegetation-induced hyporheic exchange, a series of numerical models of interlinked surface-subsurface flow modified by plant stems was conducted. Periodically staggered plant stem arrays on a flat sediment bed were considered within a coupled multiphysics computational fluid dynamics approach. Plants were idealized as rigid cylinders and arranged in different streamwise and spanwise spacing distances. Each vegetation array was then subjected to a broad range of flow Reynolds Numbers (Re). The results showed that hyporheic flow occurs in all conditions with the presence of vegetation. The vegetation-induced hyporheic flux is found to be a function of Re via a power law. The flux increases with interstem space until the space reaches the distance that rigid stems no longer affect the flow structures in the vicinity of each other. Larger intervegetation distances lead to a larger hyporheic zone. A direct comparison with bedform-induced hyporheic flow showed that vegetation can induce higher hyporheic flux through relatively shallower exchange zones. The results of all the simulations were synthesized into predictive models for hyporheic flux, bulk residence time and exchange depth based on drag coefficient, vegetation density, and Reynolds Number.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000667245100035,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR026675%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BExchange%2BDriven%2Bby%2BSubmerged%2BRigid%2BVegetation%253A%2BA%2BModeling%2BStudy%26rft.aufirst%3DYue%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DYuan%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR026675%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DYuan%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXB%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR026675,"hyporheic zone,vegetation,hyporheic exchange,bedforms,open channel,flow-vegetation interaction","OPEN-CHANNEL FLOW,TURBULENCE STRUCTURE,EMERGENT VEGETATION,BED FORMS,RIVER,TRANSPORT,PATCH,HYDRODYNAMICS,SCALE,PREDICTION",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Peoples R China"
36,36,"Roche, KR",May 2019 ,Effects of Turbulent Hyporheic Mixing on Reach-Scale Transport,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Turbulence causes rapid mixing of solutes and fine particles between open channel flow and coarse-grained streambeds. Turbulent mixing is known to control hyporheic exchange fluxes and the distribution of vertical mixing rates in the streambed, but it is unclear how turbulent mixing ultimately influences mass transport at the reach scale. We used a particle-tracking model to simulate local- and reach-scale solute transport for a stream with coarse-grained sediments. Simulations were first used to determine profiles of vertical mixing rates that best described solute concentration profiles measured within a coarse granular bed in flume experiments. These vertical mixing profiles were then used to simulate a pulse solute injection to show the effects of turbulent hyporheic exchange on reach-scale solute transport. Experimentally measured concentrations were best described by simulations with a nonmonotonic mixing profile, with highest mixing at the sediment-water interface and exponential decay into the bed. Reach-scale simulations show that this enhanced interfacial mixing couples in-stream and hyporheic solute transport. Coupling produces an interval of exponential decay in breakthrough curves and delays the onset of power law tailing. High streamwise velocities in the hyporheic zone reduce mass recovery in the water column and cause breakthrough curves to exhibit steeper power law slopes than predictions from mobile-immobile modeling theory. These results demonstrate that transport models must consider the spatial variability of streamwise velocity and vertical mixing for both the stream and the hyporheic zone, and new analytical theory is needed to describe reach-scale transport when high streamwise velocities are present in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000474848500010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2BTurbulent%2BHyporheic%2BMixing%2Bon%2BReach-Scale%2BTransport%26rft.aufirst%3DK.%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DKR%26rft.aulast%3DRoche%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR023421%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D3795%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3780-3795%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3780%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DRoche%252C%2BKR%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR023421,"hyporheic exchange,turbulence,transport,stream,CTRW,solute","SOLUTE TRANSPORT,TRANSIENT STORAGE,EXCHANGE PROCESSES,BED PERMEABILITY,CHANNEL FLOW,POROUS BED,STREAM,ZONE,MODEL,WATER",,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"
37,37,"Edwardson, KJ",Sep 2003 ,"The hydraulic characteristics and geochemistry of hyporheic and parafluvial zones in Arctic tundra streams, north slope, Alaska",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Sodium bromide and Rhodamine WT were used as conservative tracers to examine the hydrologic characteristics of seven tundra streams in Arctic Alaska, during the summers of 1994-1996. Continuous tracer additions were conducted in seven rivers ranging from 1st to 5th order with samples collected from instream, hyporheic, and parafluvial locations. Tracer data was used as input for a computer model to estimate hydrologic characteristics of each study reach. While solute concentrations during the tracer additions indicated that steady-state or ""plateau"" conditions had been reached, interstitial samples indicated that there were additional hyporheic and parafluvial zones that had not been fully labeled at the time of apparent steady state in the stream channel (plateau). Exchange between channel and hyporheic water was a function of location within a pool-riffle sequence, with rapid downwelling at the head of riffles and delayed upwelling in riffle tails. The extent of exchange between channel and hyporheic water was positively correlated with apparent streambed hydraulic conductivity. Tracer additions indicated interstitial velocities ranging from 0.030 to 0.075 cm s(-1) and hydraulic conductivities from 2.4 to 12.2 cm s(-1). Hyporheic and in-channel samples were collected for N, P, DO, and CO2 analyses in conjunction with conservative tracer additions in four of the stream reaches for which the interstitial velocities were also determined. Transformation rates based on these data indicated that there was rapid nitrification of mineralized organic N and production of ammonium, phosphate, and carbon dioxide in the interstitial zones of all four reaches. Dissolved oxygen did not appear to be limiting in the reaches studied. The hyporheic zone of all four reaches was a source of nitrate, carbon dioxide, and ammonium to the channel water based on the average concentration of upwelling waters. Increased contact time with hyporheic and parafluvial zones was related to decreased temperature and increased conductivity. Net nitrogen flux from the hyporheic zone was equivalent to 14-162% of benthic N uptake requirements for the Kuparuk River. These observations are important because we expected that the presence of continuous permafrost in this Arctic environment would limit the importance of hyporheic processes, either physically (i.e., through the presence of a restricting thaw bulb in the permafrost) or biogeochemically (i.e., through low temperatures). Instead, we found that biogeochernical processes in the hyporheic zone of these Arctic streams are at least as important as it is in similar temperate stream ecosystems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas hyporheic flow has been studied in sand-bedded streams with ripples and dunes and in gravel-bedded streams with pool-riffle morphology, little is known about its characteristics in plane bed morphology with subdued streambed undulations and sparse macroroughness elements such as boulders and cobbles. Here, we present a proof-of-concept investigation on the role of boulder-induced morphological changes on hyporheic flows based on coupling large-scale flume sediment transport experiments with computational fluid dynamics. Our results show that placement of boulders on plane beds increase the reach-scale hyporheic median residence time, tau(50), by 15% and downwelling flux, q(d), by 18% from the plane bed. However, reach-scale hyporheic exchange changes are stronger with tau(50) decreasing by 20% and q(d) increasing by 79% once the streambed morphology reached equilibrium (with the imposed upstream sediment and flow inputs on boulders). These results suggest that hyporheic flow is sensitive to the geomorphic response from bed topography and sediment transport in gravel-bedded streams, a process that has been overlooked in previous work.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000586456800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR027719%26rft.atitle%3DLocal%2Band%2BReach-Scale%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2BResponse%2BFrom%2BBoulder-Induced%2BGeomorphic%2BChanges%26rft.aufirst%3DT.%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DDudunake%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR027719%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DDudunake%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DMonsalve%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR027719,"hyporheic,stream morphology,hyporheic exchange,groundwater‐,surface water interaction,stream,sediment transport","BED FORMS,3-DIMENSIONAL MODEL,EXCHANGE,WATER,SURFACE,SOLUTES,HABITAT,SENSITIVITY,PERSPECTIVE,TRANSPORT",,"Univ Idaho, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, Boise, ID 83702 USA"

The heat transport model, which includes conduction, diffusion, and advection, is solved by a Lagrangian approach, neglecting transverse dispersion and considering stream water temperature as boundary condition at the streambed. First, we show that the model accurately reproduces the temperature distribution measured within the hyporheic zone of a reach of the Bear Valley Creek, Idaho (USA). Our model reveals spatially complex patterns of hyporheic water temperatures that vary with time within the hyporheic zone and at the streambed surface. The analysis shows that temperature distributions are primarily related to the hyporheic residence time and consequently to the bed morphology and in-stream flow discharge. Results show that the hyporheic temperature amplitudes are smaller than the surface water temperature and they decrease with stream size, leading hyporheic zones of large streams to be independent from in-stream daily temperature fluctuations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000319282100038,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bmorphodynamics%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bthermal%2Bregime%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarzadri%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20199%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2302%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2287-2302%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2287%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DMarzadri%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DBellin%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20199,"hyporheic flow,temperature,bed topography,alternate bars,residence time","TEMPERATURE,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,TRANSPORT,VELOCITY,SOLUTE,MODEL,HEAT",,"Univ Idaho, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, 322 E Front St,Ste 340, Boise, ID 83702 USA"
40,40,"Cardenas, MB",Aug 18 2004 ,"Impact of heterogeneity, bed forms, and stream curvature on subchannel hyporheic exchange",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Advection through hyporheic zones (HZ) consisting of heterogeneous channel bend streambed deposits and their equivalent homogenous medium was investigated using finite difference groundwater flow and transport simulations and forward particle tracking. The top prescribed head boundary was varied in order to mimic various stream channel head distributions resulting from the presence of bed forms and channel curvature. Flux calculations show that heterogeneity causes significant additional HZ flux compared to an equivalent homogenous medium. However, the major cause of HZ flux is a spatially periodic ( sinusoidal) head distribution along the boundary, representing the effect of bed forms. The additional influence of heterogeneity on the total channel-bed exchange and the overall HZ geometry are increased when boundary head sinusoidal fluctuation is more subdued. We present dimensionless numbers that summarize these relationships. Heterogeneity's influence is further magnified by considering the effect of channel curvature on boundary heads. The simulations illustrate the dynamic influence of heterogeneity on the hyporheic zone since the various head boundaries employed in our modeling efforts are a proxy for different surface water conditions and bed form states that may occur during a single flood. Furthermore, we show that residence times ( total tracking times) of particles originating from the streambed follow a lognormal distribution. In the presence of heterogeneity, residence times can decrease or they can increase compared to residence times for homogeneous conditions depending on the relative positions of the heterogeneities and the bed forms. Hence streambed heterogeneity and stream curvature, factors often neglected in previous modeling efforts, combine with bed form configuration to dynamically determine HZ geometry, fluxes, and residence time distributions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000223549900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08307%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2Bheterogeneity%252C%2Bbed%2Bforms%252C%2Band%2Bstream%2Bcurvature%2Bon%2Bsubchannel%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DMB%26rft.auinit%3DMB%26rft.aulast%3DCardenas%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2004WR003008%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DWilson%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DZlotnik%252C%2BVA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2004WR003008,"hyporheic zone,heterogeneity,bed forms,stream curvature,fluxes,residence times","SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,ZONE,MODEL,CHANNEL,TOPOGRAPHY,RETENTION,SEDIMENT",,"New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA"
41,41,"Fox, A",Mar 2014 ,Impact of losing and gaining streamflow conditions on hyporheic exchange fluxes induced by dune- shaped bed forms,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of water between the surface and subsurface environments plays a crucial role in hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. The exchange of water is driven by the local morphology of the streambed (hyporheic exchange) and the regional forcing of a large-scale hydraulic gradient, which results in losing or gaining flow conditions. We measured the effects of losing and gaining flow conditions on hyporheic exchange fluxes in a sandy streambed using a novel laboratory flume system (640 cm long and 30 cm wide) under a combination of average overlying velocities and losing/gaining fluxes. Hyporheic exchange fluxes were analyzed based on a new conceptual framework. This combination of experimental observations and modeling revealed that hyporheic exchange fluxes under losing and gaining flow conditions are similar. Because interfacial transport increases proportionally to the square of the overlying velocity and linearly with increasing fluxes of losing and gaining conditions in the sand bed, the hyporheic exchange flux becomes smaller when the losing or gaining flux increases. Thus, losing and gaining flow conditions become the dominant mechanisms of water exchange at a certain flux, which depends on the competitive interaction between the overlying velocity in the stream and the losing/gaining fluxes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000334111600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2Blosing%2Band%2Bgaining%2Bstreamflow%2Bconditions%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bfluxes%2Binduced%2Bby%2Bdune-%2Bshaped%2Bbed%2Bforms%26rft.aufirst%3DAryeh%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DFox%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR014668%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1907%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1895-1907%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1895%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DFox%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBoano%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DArnon%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR014668,"Hyporheic exchange flux,stream-aquifer interaction,losing stream,gaining stream,groundwater discharge,hyporheic exchange modeling","NONSORBING SOLUTES,CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY,TRANSIENT STORAGE,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN,LOW-ENERGY,GROUNDWATER,WATER,ZONE,FLOW,DENITRIFICATION",,"Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Jacob Blaustein Inst Desert Res, Zuckerberg Inst Water Res, Dept Environm Hydrol & Microbiol, IL-84993 Sede Boqer, Israel"
42,42,"Chow, R",May-jun 2019 ,Sensitivity of Simulated Hyporheic Exchange to River Bathymetry: The Steinlach River Test Site,GROUNDWATER,"This study determines the aspects of river bathymetry that have the greatest influence on the predictive biases when simulating hyporheic exchange. To investigate this, we build a highly parameterized HydroGeoSphere model of the Steinlach River Test Site in southwest Germany as a reference. This model is then modified with simpler bathymetries, evaluating the changes to hyporheic exchange fluxes and transit time distributions. Results indicate that simulating hyporheic exchange with a high-resolution detailed bathymetry using a three-dimensional fully coupled model leads to nested multiscale hyporheic exchange systems. A poorly resolved bathymetry will underestimate the small-scale hyporheic exchange, biasing the simulated hyporheic exchange towards larger scales, thus leading to overestimates of hyporheic exchange residence times. This can lead to gross biases in the estimation of a catchment's capacity to attenuate pollutants when extrapolated to account for all meanders along an entire river within a watershed. The detailed river slope alone is not enough to accurately simulate the locations and magnitudes of losing and gaining river reaches. Thus, local bedforms in terms of bathymetric highs and lows within the river are required. Bathymetry surveying campaigns can be more effective by prioritizing bathymetry measurements along the thalweg and gegenweg of a meandering channel. We define the gegenweg as the line that connects the shallowest points in successive cross-sections along a river opposite to the thalweg under average flow conditions. Incorporating local bedforms will likely capture the nested nature of hyporheic exchange, leading to more physically meaningful simulations of hyporheic exchange fluxes and transit times.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000467295900005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSensitivity%2Bof%2BSimulated%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bto%2BRiver%2BBathymetry%253A%2BThe%2BSteinlach%2BRiver%2BTest%2BSite%26rft.aufirst%3DReynold%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DChow%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12816%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D391%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D378-391%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D378%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DChow%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DNowak%252C%2BW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gwat.12816,,MODEL,,"Univ Tubingen, Ctr Appl Geosci, Holderlinstr 12, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany"
43,43,"Hill, AR",Sep 1998 ,Hyporheic zone hydrology and nitrogen dynamics in relation to the streambed topography of a N-rich stream,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"The influence of riffle-pool units on hyporheic zone hydrology and nitrogen dynamics was investigated in Brougham Creek, a N-rich agricultural stream in Ontario, Canada. Subsurface hydraulic gradients, differences in background stream and groundwater concentrations of conservative ions, and the movement of a bromide tracer indicated the downwelling of stream water at the head of riffles and upwelling in riffle-pool transitions under base flow conditions. Channel water also flowed laterally into the floodplain at the upstream end of riffles and followed a subsurface concentric flow path for distances of up to 20 m before returning to the stream at the transition from riffles to pools. Differences in observed vs predicted concentrations based on background chloride patterns indicated that the hyporheic zone was a sink for nitrate and a source for ammonium. The removal of nitrate in the streambed was confirmed by the loss of nitrate in relation to co-injected bromide in areas of downwelling stream water in two riffles. Average stream water nitrate-N concentrations of 1.0 mg/L were often depleted to <0.005 mg/L near the sediment-water interface. Consequently, an extensive volume of the hyporheic zone in the streambed and floodplain had a large unused potential for nitrate removal. Conceptual models based mainly on studies of streams with low nutrient concentrations have emphasized the extent of surface-subsurface exchanges and water residence times in the hyporheic zone as important controls on stream nutrient retention. In contrast, we suggest that nitrate retention in N-rich streams is influenced more by the size of surface water storage zones which increase the residence time of channel water in contact with the major sites of rapid nitrate depletion adjacent to the sediment-water interface.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000075584900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bzone%2Bhydrology%2Band%2Bnitrogen%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Brelation%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bstreambed%2Btopography%2Bof%2Ba%2BN-rich%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DAR%26rft.auinit%3DAR%26rft.aulast%3DHill%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1005932528748%26rft.epage%3D310%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D285-310%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D285%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DHill%252C%2BAR%26rft.au%3DLabadia%252C%2BCF%26rft.au%3DSanmugadas%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1023/A:1005932528748,"ammonium,groundwater,hydrologic exchange,hyporheic zone,nitrate,streams","HYDROGRAPH SEPARATION,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,WATER EXCHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,DENITRIFICATION,SEDIMENTS,ECOSYSTEM,NITRATE,FLOW",,"York Univ, Dept Geog, 4700 Keele St, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada"
44,44,"Gooseff, MN",Jun 30 2003 ,Determining long time-scale hyporheic zone flow paths in Antarctic streams,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, glaciers are the source of meltwater during the austral summer, and the streams and adjacent hyporheic zones constitute the entire physical watershed; there are no hillslope processes in these systems. Hyporheic zones can extend several metres from each side of the stream, and are up to 70 cm deep, corresponding to a lateral cross-section as large as 12 m(2), and water resides in the subsurface year around. In this study, we differentiate between the near-stream hyporheic zone, which can be characterized with stream tracer experiments, and the extended hyporheic zone, which has a longer time-scale of exchange. We sampled stream water from Green Creek and from the adjacent saturated alluvium for stable isotopes of D and O-18 to assess the significance and extent of stream-water exchange between the streams and extended hyporheic zones over long time-scales (days to weeks). Our results show that water residing in the extended hyporheic zone is much more isotopically enriched (up to 11parts per thousand D and 2-2parts per thousand O-18) than stream water. This result suggests a long residence time within the extended hyporheic zone, during which fractionation has occurred owing to summer evaporation and winter sublimation of hyporheic water. We found less enriched water in the extended hyporheic zone later in the flow season, suggesting that stream water may be exchanged into and out of this zone, on the time-scale of weeks to months. The transient storage model OTIS was used to characterize the exchange of stream water with the extended hyporheic zone. Model results yield exchange rates (a) generally an order magnitude lower (10(-5) s(-1)) than those determined using stream-tracer techniques on the same stream. In light of previous studies in these streams, these results suggest that the hyporheic zones in Antarctic streams have near-stream zones of rapid stream-water exchange, where 'fast' biogeochemical reactions may influence water chemistry, and extended hyporheic zones, in which slower biogeochemical reaction rates may affect stream-water chemistry at longer time-scales.

45,45,"Gordon, RP",Apr 2013 ,Spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical cycling around cross-vane restoration structures: Implications for stream restoration design,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Natural channel design restoration projects in streams often include the construction of cross-vanes, which are stone, dam-like structures that span the active channel. Vertical hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) and redox-sensitive solutes were measured in the streambed around four cross-vanes with different morphologies. Observed patterns of HEF and redox conditions are not dominated by a single, downstream-directed hyporheic flow cell beneath cross-vanes. Instead, spatial patterns of moderate (<0.4 m d1) upwelling and downwelling are distributed in smaller cells around pool and riffle bed forms upstream and downstream of structures. Patterns of biogeochemical cycling are controlled by dissolved oxygen concentrations and resulting redox conditions, and are also oriented around secondary bed forms. Strong downwelling into the hyporheic zone (0.53.5 m d1) was observed immediately upstream of structures, but was limited to an area 12 m from the cross-vane; these hyporheic flow paths likely rejoin the stream at the base of cross-vanes after residence times too short to alter nitrate concentrations or accumulate reaction products. Total hyporheic exchange volumes are approximate to 0.4% of stream discharge in restored reaches of 4555 m. Results show that shallow hyporheic flow and associated biogeochemical cycling near cross-vanes is primarily controlled by secondary bed forms created or augmented by the cross-vane, rather than by the cross-vane itself. This study suggests that cross-vane restoration structures benefit the stream ecosystem by creating heterogeneous patches of varying HEF and redox conditions in the hyporheic zone, rather than by processing large amounts of nutrients to alter in-stream water chemistry.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000319282100020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Bpatterns%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bcycling%2Baround%2Bcross-vane%2Brestoration%2Bstructures%253A%2BImplications%2Bfor%2Bstream%2Brestoration%2Bdesign%26rft.aufirst%3DRyan%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DRP%26rft.aulast%3DGordon%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20185%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2055%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2040-2055%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2040%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DGordon%252C%2BRP%26rft.au%3DLautz%252C%2BLK%26rft.au%3DDaniluk%252C%2BTL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20185,"groundwater-surface water interaction,hyporheic zone,stream restoration,heat tracing,redox biogeochemistry,nitrate","WATER,SURFACE,ZONE,RIVERS,TIME,FLUX,POTASSIUM,OXIDATION,HEAT,FLOW",,"Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth Sci, 204 Heroy Geol Lab, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA"

Two salt in-stream tracer experiments were conducted and evaluated using a transient storage model to characterize seasonal differences in stream residence time and transient storage. Lagrangian and time-integrated surface water sampling were conducted to calculated half-lives in the surface water. Half-lives in the were calculated using porewater samples obtained from a modified mini-point sampler and hyporheic residence times measured via active heat-pulse sensing. Half of the investigated TrOCs (e.g., oxazepam, olmesartan, candesartan) were not significantly removed along both the investigated river stretch and the sampled hyporheic flow paths. The remaining TrOCs (e.g., metformin, guanylurea, valsartan) were found to be significantly removed in the HZ and along the river stretch with relative removals in the HZ correlating to reach-scale relative removals. Using the modeled transport parameters, it was estimated that wet season reach-scale removal of TrOCs was predominately caused by removal in the HZ when the intensity of hyporheic exchange was also higher. Factors that increase HZ exchange are thus likely to promote in-stream reactivity of TrOCs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000449722200033,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BExchange%2BControls%2BFate%2Bof%2BTrace%2BOrganic%2BCompounds%2Bin%2Ban%2BUrban%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DJonas%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DSchaper%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.est.8b03117%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D12294%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D21%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D12285-12294%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D12285%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DSchaper%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DPosselt%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/acs.est.8b03117,,"TRANSFORMATION PRODUCT GUANYLUREA,SORPTION INFLUENCED TRANSPORT,ANTIDIABETIC DRUG METFORMIN,WASTE-WATER,TRANSIENT STORAGE,ACTIVATED CARBON,BETA-BLOCKERS,PHARMACEUTICALS,ATTENUATION,RIVERS",,"Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecohydrol, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany"
47,47,"Hester, ET",Mar 15 2008 ,In-stream geomorphic structures as drivers of hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Common in-stream geomorphic structures such as debris dams and steps can drive hyporheic exchange in streams. Exchange is important for ecological stream function, and restoring function is a goal of many stream restoration projects, yet the connection between in-stream geomorphic form, hydrogeologic setting, and hyporheic exchange remains inadequately characterized. We used the models HEC-RAS, MODFLOW, and MODPATH to simulate coupled surface and subsurface hydraulics in a gaining stream containing a single in-stream geomorphic structure and to systematically evaluate the impact of fundamental characteristics of the structure and its hydrogeologic setting on induced exchange. We also conducted a field study to support model results. Model results indicated that structure size, background groundwater discharge rate, and sediment hydraulic conductivity are the most important factors determining the magnitude of induced hyporheic exchange, followed by geomorphic structure type, depth to bedrock, and channel slope. Model results indicated channel-spanning structures were more effective at driving hyporheic flow than were partially spanning structures, and weirs were more effective than were steps. Across most structure types, downwelling flux rate increased linearly with structure size, yet hyporheic residence time exhibited nonlinear behavior, increasing quickly with size at low structure sizes and declining thereafter. Important trends in model results were observed at the field site and also interpreted using simple hydraulic theory, thereby supporting the modeling approach and clarifying underlying processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000254170200002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW03417%26rft.atitle%3DIn-stream%2Bgeomorphic%2Bstructures%2Bas%2Bdrivers%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DErich%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2006WR005810%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DDoyle%252C%2BMW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2006WR005810,,"TRANSIENT STORAGE,MODELING SURFACE,WATER,FLOW,TRANSPORT,ZONE,RETENTION",,"Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Ecol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA"
48,48,"Faulkner, BR",Jul 2 2012 ,Hyporheic flow patterns in relation to large river floodplain attributes,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Field-calibrated models of hyporheic flow have emphasized low-order headwater systems. In many cases, however, hyporheic flow in large lowland river floodplains may be an important contributor to ecosystem services such as maintenance of water quality and habitat. In this study, we used a network of shallow monitoring wells, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and continuous monitoring to parameterize and calibrate stochastic three-dimensional ground water models for a 9.7 km(2) (2400 acres) area along a naturally-meandering section of the Willamette River floodplain in Oregon. This large river floodplain is representative of other similar systems. Steady-state simulations were done representing the wet winter and dry summer seasons. During the dry season, hyporheic flow was oriented along the floodplain elevation gradient and median steady-state residence times in small islands and bars were on the order of months. In the larger islands steady-state residence times were on the order of years. In the wet season, flow was oriented laterally away from the river and quickly intercepted and returned to the surface water system in alcoves and cutoffs connected to the river, and recharge due to infiltration of precipitation prevented hyporheic flow through older island areas. In the younger islands, median steady-state residence times ranged from about 6.1 x 10(1) to 1.6 x 10(2) days. In the model domain overall, the steady-state dry season median pathline length was about 8.2 x 10(2) with a maximum length of about 5.7 x 10(3) m. For the wet season, the median was about 2.0 x 10(2) m with a maximum length of about 3.5 x 10(3) m. Wet season hyporheic water penetrated deeper into the lower permeability geologic units by an order of magnitude, as compared to the dry season. This was likely due to the absence of precipitation infiltration during the dry season. We used particle tracking in order to characterize residence time distributions for hyporheic water. We found two behaviors: lognormal decay with shorter distributions of residence times, and heavy tailing, following power-law behavior. Interestingly, we found the heavy tailing behavior more during the wet season when mean residence times were short. This result implies that even though some rates of hyporheic flow were relatively fast, there were also zones of relatively stagnant water causing this large variation in residence time. Observed slopes for log-log plots of the histograms fell in the range of 2.3-5.6. This behavior appeared to be restricted to regions affected by natural river meandering, where avulsions create isolated islands. In some areas, land managers may consider revetment removal as a means to convert channelized systems to more natural systems with shallower depths in the main channel, meander scrolls, and alcoves that can enhance hyporheic flow. The results of this study provide information on how such decisions may affect the extent of hyporheic flow that may occur as a large river returns to its natural geomorphological dynamics.

49,49,"Osenbruck, K",May 2013 ,"Assessing hyporheic exchange and associated travel times by hydraulic, chemical, and isotopic monitoring at the Steinlach Test Site, Germany",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"First results of a multi-disciplinary hyporheic monitoring study are presented from the newly established Steinlach Test Site in Southern Germany. The site is located in a bend of the River Steinlach (mean discharge of 1.8 mA(3)/s) underlain by an alluvial sandy gravel aquifer connected to the stream. The overall objective is a better understanding of hyporheic exchange processes at the site and their interrelations with microbial community dynamics and biochemical reactions at the stream-groundwater interface. The present paper focuses on the distribution of lateral hyporheic exchange fluxes and their associated travel times at the Steinlach Test Site. Water level dynamics in various piezometers correspond to the different domains of hydraulic conductivity in the shallow aquifer and confirms hyporheic exchange of infiltrated stream water across the test site. Hydrochemical compositions as well as increased damping of continuous time series of electrical conductivity (EC) and temperature at the respective piezometers confirmed the inferred distribution of hyporheic flowpaths. Mean travel times ranging from 0.5 days close to the stream to more than 8 days in the upstream part of the test site could be estimated from deconvolution of EC and delta O-18-H2O data. The travel times agree well with the presumed flowpaths. Mg/Ca ratios as well as model fits to the EC and delta O-18 data indicate the presence of an additional water component in the western part of the test site which most likely consists of hillslope water or groundwater. Based on the mean travel times, the total lateral hyporheic exchange flux at the site was estimated to be of the order of 1-2 L/s.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000318280400005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAssessing%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bassociated%2Btravel%2Btimes%2Bby%2Bhydraulic%252C%2Bchemical%252C%2Band%2Bisotopic%2Bmonitoring%2Bat%2Bthe%2BSteinlach%2BTest%2BSite%252C%2BGermany%26rft.aufirst%3DKarsten%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DOsenbrueck%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-012-2155-4%26rft.epage%3D372%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D359-372%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D359%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D69%26rft.au%3DOsenbruck%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DWohling%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DCirpka%252C%2BOA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DZ9jabfNKDym2TPN19gI&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-012-2155-4,"Hyporheic zone,Stream-groundwater interaction,Travel time distribution,Deconvolution,Monitoring","WATER INTERACTIONS,RESIDENCE TIMES,BANK FILTRATION,GROUNDWATER,TEMPERATURE,ZONE,STREAM,TRANSPORT,TRACERS,RIVERS",,"Univ Tubingen, Water & Earth Syst Sci WESS Competence Cluster, Holderlinstr 12, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany"
