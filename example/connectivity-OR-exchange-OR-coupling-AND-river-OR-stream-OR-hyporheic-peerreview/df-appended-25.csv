0,0,"Eglin, I",Mar 1997 ,Macrophyte biological methods used in the study of the exchange between the Rhine river and the groundwater,WATER RESEARCH,"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficiency of two biological methods in the study of the exchange between the canalized Rhine river and its riverside aquifer. The infiltration of Rhine water into the groundwater is revealed by a high level of eutrophicants and the micropollutant mercury. One method made use of the aquatic macrophyte communities as bioindicators of the degree of eutrophication based on phosphorus and nitrogen, and the second method, the capacity of the bryophytes to accumulate mercury. The results obtained with both methods show that bioindication using autochthonous aquatic macrophyte species can be used as an efficient method in river-groundwater exchange investigation.

1,1,"Mahdi, TF",Jun 2009 ,Semi-two-dimensional numerical model for river morphological change prediction: theory and concepts,NATURAL HAZARDS,"This paper presents a new numerical model for river morphological predictions. This tool predicts vertical and lateral cross-section variations for alluvial rivers, which is an important task in predicting the associated hazard zone after a flood event. The Model for the HYdraulics of SEdiments in Rivers, version 1.0 (MHYSER 1.0) is a semi-two-dimensional model using the stream tubes concept to achieve lateral variations of velocity, flow stresses, and sediment transport rates. Each stream tube has the same conveyance as the other ones. In MHYSER 1.0, the uncoupled approach is used to solve the set of conservation equations. After the backwater calculation, the river is divided into a finite number of stream tubes of equal conveyances. The sediment routing and bed adjustments calculations are accomplished separately along each stream tube taking into account lateral mass exchanges. The determination of depth and width adjustments is based on the minimum stream power theory. Moreover, MHYSER 1.0 offers two options to treat riverbank stability. The first one is based on the angle of repose. The bank slope should not be allowed to increase beyond a certain critical value supplied to MHYSER 1.0. The second one is based on the modified Bishop's method to determine a safety factor evaluating the potential risk of a landslide along the river bank.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000265826000009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSemi-two-dimensional%2Bnumerical%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Briver%2Bmorphological%2Bchange%2Bprediction%253A%2Btheory%2Band%2Bconcepts%26rft.aufirst%3DTew-Fik%26rft.auinit%3DTF%26rft.aulast%3DMahdi%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11069-008-9304-9%26rft.epage%3D576%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0921-030X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURAL%2BHAZARDS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D565-576%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D565%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BHAZARDS%26rft.volume%3D49&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=NATURAL+HAZARDS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11069-008-9304-9,"River natural hazards,Sediment routing,Semi-2-D numerical model,Stream tubes,Stream power minimization,Riverbank stability",,,"Ecole Polytech, Dept Genies Civil Geol & Mines CGM, CP 6079,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada"
2,2,"De Giudici, G",Jan 2017 ,The role of natural biogeochemical barriers in limiting metal loading to a stream affected by mine drainage,APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"Rio San Giorgio (Iglesiente, Sardinia, Italy), a stream affected by abandoned mine wastes, is characterized by dense vegetation in the streambed, mainly comprised of Phragmites australis and Juncus acutus. This vegetation creates natural biogeochemical barriers that drive mineralization processes and attenuate metals load in the stream. Several techniques, covering scales from micrometres to kilometres, were applied to investigate the biogeochemical processes: water chemistry, injected hydrologic tracer, mineralogy, microscopic investigation and X-ray spectroscopy. From this multiscale and multimethod approach, we recognized two predominant sets of biogeochemical processes: microbially driven metal sulphide precipitation, mainly resulting in pyrite formation; and plant uptake of metals that leads to formation of iron oxide-hydroxide and incorporation of Zn within the roots and aerial part (stem and leaves). The dense vegetation in the Rio San Giorgio streambed controls its morphology, velocity of streamflow, and, as reflected by observed bromide-tracer loss, enhanced water exchange between the streambed and the hyporheic zone. The combined effect of these vegetative controls is to establish biogeochemical barriers that greatly retard trace-metal mobility in the hyporheic zone. We estimated this effect can lead to an apparent decrease in Zn load up to 60%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

3,3,"Xin, Y",Aug 5 2022 ,Coupling driving factors of eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in the yellow river basin,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"Most cities in the Yellow River Basin are located in the central and western regions of China. Restricted by historical evolution, natural environment, resource endowments and other conditions, the economic and social development model of the Yellow River Basin region is outdated, and the level of economic and social development is relatively lagging, which hinders its coordinated development of ecology and economy. This paper uses the coupling coordination degree model, GIS spatial analysis method, NAR neural network model, spatial autoregression, and geographically weighted regression model to investigate the coupling coordination level, spatial differentiation characteristics, future development trend, and coupling driving factors of eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin. The results show that From 2003 to 2018, the level of eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in most areas of the Yellow River Basin gradually improved, presenting a spatial imbalance characteristic of ""high in the east and low in the west. The coupling coordination degree of eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in various regions of the Yellow River Basin increased year by year during the survey period. In 2018, most cities had been transformed into intermediate coordinated development areas, and most cities in Inner Mongolia and the middle and lower reaches south of the Yellow River have been upgraded to a well-coordinated development stage. The coupled and coordinated development relationship between eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin has significant spatial agglomeration characteristics, and the local spatial positive correlation gradually increases. From 2019 to 2023, the average level of coupling coordination between eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin during the forecast period is 0.802, 0.807, 0.809, 0.813, and 0.816, respectively, all of which have entered a stage of well-coordinated development. The coupled driving factors of ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin are ranked from strong to weak: energy utilization, urbanization, water resources development, and industrialization. Among them, the degree of energy utilization is the root of the differentiation of coupling coordination between eco-environmental protection and high-quality development in 74 regions of the Yellow River Basin. This study puts forward two strategic suggestions based on the optimal utilization strategy of energy and water resources and the coordinated promotion strategy of industrialization and urbanization, which has great practical and scientific significance for promoting the coordinated development of ecological environment protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000842985100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B951218%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bdriving%2Bfactors%2Bof%2Beco-environmental%2Bprotection%2Band%2Bhigh-quality%2Bdevelopment%2Bin%2Bthe%2Byellow%2Briver%2Bbasin%26rft.aufirst%3DYun%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DXin%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffenvs.2022.951218%26rft.eissn%3D2296-665X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BENV%2BSCI-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DXin%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BXY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/fenvs.2022.951218,"yellow river basin,eco-environmental protection,high-quality development,coupled and coordinated development,driving factors",,,"Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Stat, Nanchang, Peoples R China"
4,4,"Churchill, CJ",May 2018 ,Downstream dispersal of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) under different flow conditions in a coupled lake-stream ecosystem,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,"Dispersal, establishment, and spread of aquatic invasive species such as the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) can be influenced by riverine velocities and volumetric flows in invaded lake-stream ecosystems. Zebra mussels, which have a planktonic larval form (veliger), disperse rapidly downstream from a source population. Concentrations, dispersal, and body conditions of zebra mussel veligers were studied under different volumetric flow, or discharge, conditions in a coupled lake-stream ecosystem in northern Texas, USA. Veliger densities in lotic environments were strongly related to population dynamics in upstream lentic source populations. A strong exponential decrease in veliger density was observed through a 28-km downstream study reach. Increased water releases from the source reservoir increased veliger flux and dispersal potential, concomitantly increasing veliger flux and decreasing transit time. However, passage through release gates in the dam and increased turbulence in the river during high-discharge events could negatively affect body condition of veligers, and veliger body condition generally decreased from the source population to the farthest downstream site and was lower for veligers during periods of high discharge. Thus increased discharge appears to reduce the proportion of viable veligers because of increased turbulence-induced mortality. Colonization of distant downstream reservoirs can occur if discharge and propagule pressure are sufficient or if interim habitats are suitable for establishment of in-stream populations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000431787700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDownstream%2Bdispersal%2Bof%2Bzebra%2Bmussels%2B%2528Dreissena%2Bpolymorpha%2529%2Bunder%2Bdifferent%2Bflow%2Bconditions%2Bin%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2Blake-stream%2Becosystem%26rft.aufirst%3DChristopher%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DCJ%26rft.aulast%3DChurchill%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10530-017-1613-z%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1464%26rft.epage%3D1127%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1387-3547%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOLOGICAL%2BINVASIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1113-1127%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1113%26rft.stitle%3DBIOL%2BINVASIONS%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DChurchill%252C%2BCJ%26rft.au%3DQuigley%252C%2BDP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=BIOLOGICAL+INVASIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10530-017-1613-z,"Veliger,River,Flux,Velocities Discharge,Population dynamics","DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA,LARVAL DYNAMICS,POPULATION,INVASIONS,SPREAD,MORTALITY,PHYTOPLANKTON,RECRUITMENT,PATTERNS,VELIGERS",,"USGS Texas Water Sci Ctr, North Texas Program Off, 501 West Felix St,BLDG 24, Ft Worth, TX 76115 USA"
5,5,"Thanh, LD",Oct 2022 ,Application of critical path analysis to streaming potential coupling coefficient in porous media,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Streaming potential is a passive hydrogeophysical method that can be used to monitor water flow in porous media. However, a quantitative use of this method requires a good understanding of the streaming potential generation in water saturated porous media. In this work, we used the Critical Path Analysis (CPA) method to propose a new model to estimate the streaming potential coupling coefficient (SPCC) in porous media. By comparing the proposed model with 109 experimental data points for both unconsolidated samples such as uniform glass bead and sand packs and consolidated samples such as sandstones, carbonates and with 36 simulated data points, we demonstrated that the CPA is applicable to model the SPCC for porous media with both narrow and broad pore size distributions. Additionally, from the obtained result for the uniform grain packings, we found the r(c)-d relationship between the critical pore radius r(c )and grain diameter d that was validated by using 70 experimental data points available in literature. The obtained r(c)-d relationship may be helpful for applications of CPA-based models for uniform grain packings. We believe that the CPA-based model is an useful alternative approach for modeling the streaming potential coupling coefficient in porous media along with two other models available in literature.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000860484700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B104289%26rft.atitle%3DApplication%2Bof%2Bcritical%2Bpath%2Banalysis%2Bto%2Bstreaming%2Bpotential%2Bcoupling%2Bcoefficient%2Bin%2Bporous%2Bmedia%26rft.aufirst%3DLuong%2BDuy%26rft.auinit%3DLD%26rft.aulast%3DLuong%2BDuy%2BThanh%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2022.104289%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D168%26rft.au%3DThanh%252C%2BLD%26rft.au%3DNghia%252C%2BNV%26rft.au%3DJougnot%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104289,"Streaming potential,Zeta potential,Critical path analysis,Porous media","ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY,PORE-SIZE,PERMEABILITY PREDICTION,MODEL,ROCK,FLOW,MOVEMENT,RESISTIVITY,GENERATION,DEPENDENCE",,"Thuyloi Univ, 175 Tay Son, Hanoi, Vietnam"

The ARiD (Atmospheric River Detector) code has been developed to automatically detect atmospheric rivers from water vapor flux and has been applied to the ECMWF ERA5 archive over the period 1980-2020 above the Atlantic Ocean and Europe. A case study of an atmospheric river formed in the East Atlantic on August 2014 that reached France has been detailed using ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis, ground based observation data, and satellite products such as DARDAR, AIRS, GPCP, and GOES. This atmospheric river event presents a strong interaction with an intense upper tropospheric jet stream, which induced stratosphere-troposphere exchanges by tropopause fold. A 1980-2020 climatology of atmospheric rivers over Europe has been presented. The west of France, Iberian Peninsula, and British Islands are the most impacted regions by atmospheric rivers with an occurrence of up to four days per month during the October-April period. Up to 40% of the precipitation observed on the west European coast can be linked to the presence of ARs.

7,7,"Rivett, MO",Feb 2008 ,Cost-effective mini drive-point piezometers and multilevel samplers for monitoring the hyporheic zone,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY,"The development of cost-effective approaches to monitor groundwater-surface-water exchange processes and contaminant fate within the hyporheic zone fundamentally underpins implementation of legislation such as the European Community Water Framework Directive, which requires integrated management of groundwater and surface water. Cost-effective mini drive-point piezometers (MDPs) and multilevel samplers (MLSs) are presented that use cheap construction materials, involve simple fabrication and installation procedures, and have a proven durability with low vulnerability to flood events and vandalism. They have been used across a range of hydro(geo) logical settings in the UK and proven to be effective in discerning flow exchange, geochemical trends, and contaminant transport and attenuation over monitored depths of 0.25 to 2 m at a resolution as low as 0.05 m. Example depth profiles, cross-river transects and river-reach longitudinal profiles from the River Tame catchment (West Midlands, UK) illustrate the value of MDP-MLS approaches in establishing surface-water-groundwater mixing zone depths, contaminant natural attenuation as a result of biotic activity within the hyporheic zone, and estimates of contaminant flux exchanges between groundwater and surface water. The MDP-MLS approaches allow discernment of contaminated groundwater plume discharges that may go undetected, or at best poorly resolved, if reliance was solely placed on conventional riverside monitoring wells and/or surface-water sampling. The MDP-MLS approaches described also have potential to be used in the investigation of shallow sediment aquifers, lake shorelines and wetland features.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000253782000005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCost-effective%2Bmini%2Bdrive-point%2Bpiezometers%2Band%2Bmultilevel%2Bsamplers%2Bfor%2Bmonitoring%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BO.%26rft.auinit%3DMO%26rft.aulast%3DRivett%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1144%252F1470-9236%252F07-012%26rft.eissn%3D2041-4803%26rft.epage%3D60%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1470-9236%26rft.jtitle%3DQUARTERLY%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENGINEERING%2BGEOLOGY%2BAND%2BHYDROGEOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D49-60%26rft.part%3D1%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D49%26rft.stitle%3DQ%2BJ%2BENG%2BGEOL%2BHYDROGE%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DRivett%252C%2BMO%26rft.au%3DEllis%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DDowle%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=QUARTERLY+JOURNAL+OF+ENGINEERING+GEOLOGY+AND+HYDROGEOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1144/1470-9236/07-012,,"SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION,AQUIFER,BIRMINGHAM,RIVER,CITY",,"Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England"

We analyze this exchange process by finite-element modeling of groundwater flow and transport through model-generated river planforms taken from previous studies. The river is considered as a constant-head boundary that decreases linearly along the direction of the channel. This leads to an irregular groundwater flowfield in the pointbar that is controlled by channel sinuosity. Simulations under homogeneous aquifer conditions shows that the variable flowpath lengths coupled with the heterogeneous flow velocities lead to non-Fickian transport characterized by power-law residence time distributions. This anomalous transport behavior is enhanced by increased aquifer dispersivity. The broad transit time distribution implies that time-dependent chemical transformation processes in near-stream zones may be equally variable as the flowfield, even in the absence of heterogeneity in aquifer hydraulic properties.

High-resolution numerical models were often used to resolve the spatial and temporal variations of exchange flows, which are computationally expensive. In this study, we adopt Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) approaches for deriving reduced order models of hydrologic exchange flows and associated transit time distributions, with integrated field observations (e.g., bathymetry) and hydrodynamic simulation data (e.g., river velocity, depth). The setup allows an improved understanding of the influences of various physical, spatial, and temporal factors on the hydrologic exchange flows and transit times. The predictors also contain those derived using hybrid clustering, leveraging our previous work on river corridor system hydromorphic classification. The machine learning-based predictive models are developed and validated along the Columbia River Corridor, and the results show that the top parameters are the thickness of the top geological formation layer, the flow regime, river velocity, and river depth; the RF and XGB models can achieve 70% to 80% accuracy and therefore are effective alternatives to the computational demanding numerical models of exchange flows and transit time distributions. Each machine learning model with its favorable configuration and setup have been evaluated. The transferability of the models to other river reaches and larger scales, which mostly depends on data availability, is also discussed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000751704800065,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B648071%26rft.atitle%3DMachine%2BLearning%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BHydrologic%2BExchange%2BFlows%2Band%2BTransit%2BTime%2BDistributions%2Bin%2Ba%2BLarge%2BRegulated%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DHuiying%26rft.auinit%3DHY%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrai.2021.648071%26rft.eissn%3D2624-8212%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BARTIFICIAL%2BINTELLIGENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BARTIF%2BINTELL%26rft.volume%3D4%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BHY%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BXH%26rft.au%3DScheibe%252C%2BTD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+ARTIFICIAL+INTELLIGENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/frai.2021.648071,"machine learning,random forest,extreme gradient boosting,spatial heterogeneity,transit time,hydrologic exchange flows","RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER,HYPORHEIC ZONE,DAM OPERATIONS,GROUNDWATER,ENSEMBLE,DYNAMICS,MODELS,IMPACT",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Earth & Biol Sci Directorate, Richland, WA 99352 USA"
10,10,"Smith, JWN",Jan 1 2008 ,"Groundwater-surface water interactions, nutrient fluxes and ecological response in river corridors: Translating science into effective environmental management",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"A summary is provided of the second in a series of Integrated Science Initiative workshops supported by the UNESCO International Hydrological Programme. The workshop brought together hydrologists, ecologists, biogeochemists, hydro-geologists and natural resource managers to discuss the processes that occur in hyporheic and riparian ecotones. The principal objectives were to share new ideas on the importance of biogeochemical processes that affect nutrients at the groundwater-surface water interface, to understand the impact of nutrient flux on stream (principally hyporheic) ecology, and to identify the management strategies for river corridors to mitigate the effects of nutrients applied to land and discharged via groundwater into rivers. The workshop concluded that: (1) more interdisciplinary research and environmental management practices are needed to better understand, predict and manage processes at the interface of environmental compartments; (2) the goal of environmental regulations to improve ecological health requires a holistic approach integrating our understanding of the ecological, hydrological, biogeochemical and physical processes; (3) upscaling spatially and temporally variable processes remains difficult and may hinder translation of research at micro-scales (molecular to grain size) into macro-scale (reach to catchment) decision-making; (4) scientists need to better communicate existing research to river managers, while smanagers must better communicate policy and regulatory-driven science requirements to researchers. Existing models, such as those that simulate stream-hyporheic exchange, are not widely known and rarely used by environmental managers.

11,11,"Egeberg, PK",May 1998 ,The effect of river liming on the trace metal budgets of a down stream lake,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"Sediment cores from two lakes, connected by a limed river, were analyzed for organic matter, calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and ion exchange capacity. The distribution of trace metals in the pristine upper lake is governed primarily by changes in the long distance atmospheric transported pollutants. In the lake down stream of the liming station the distribution of trace metals in sediments deposited before liming started (1985) is similar to that in the pristine lake. Liming of the connecting river raises the pH value by about 1.8 units from 5.1 enhancing the accumulation rate of trace metals in the downstream lake. Iron enriched acid insoluble particles are likely to be important carriers of trace metals. The liming agent itself is the most important source for Pb, while increased accumulation of Zn and Cd is caused primarily by enhanced scavenging of dissolved metals. For Cu the two sources are of about equal importance.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000073482600005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Beffect%2Bof%2Briver%2Bliming%2Bon%2Bthe%2Btrace%2Bmetal%2Bbudgets%2Bof%2Ba%2Bdown%2Bstream%2Blake%26rft.aufirst%3DPK%26rft.auinit%3DPK%26rft.aulast%3DEgeberg%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1004955216612%26rft.epage%3D75%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0049-6979%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BAND%2BSOIL%2BPOLLUTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D57-75%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D57%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BSOIL%2BPOLL%26rft.volume%3D104%26rft.au%3DEgeberg%252C%2BPK%26rft.au%3DHakedal%252C%2BJT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=WATER+AIR+AND+SOIL+POLLUTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1023/A:1004955216612,"acidification,liming,trace metals","SWEDISH LAKE,ACIDIFICATION,WATER,CHEMISTRY,POLLUTION,SEDIMENTS,SWEDEN,NORWAY",,"Agder Coll, Fac Math & Sci, Tordenskjoldsgt 65, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway"

In the study, a typical peri-urban river, Nansha River, was selected as a case study to discuss the scheme of peri-urban river rehabilitation. Located in the north part of the Beijing central region, the Nansha River watershed has been designated as an ecologically friendly garden-style area with high-tech industry parks and upscale residential zones. However, the Nansha River is currently seriously contaminated by urban and rural pollutants from both nonpoint sources (NPS) and point sources (PS). In this study, the pollutant loads from point sources and nonpoint sources in the Nansha River watershed were first assessed. A coupled model, derived from the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code and Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program, was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics and water quality in the Nansha River. According to the characteristics of the typical peri-urban river, three different PS and NPS control scenarios were designed and examined by modeling analyses.

13,13,"Gao, JH",May 15 2014 ,"Changes in water and sediment exchange between the Changjiang River and Poyang Lake under natural and anthropogenic conditions, China",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"To study the fluvial interaction between Changjiang River and Poyang Lake, we analyze the observed changes of riverine flux of the mid-upstream of Changjiang River catchment, the five river systems of Poyang Lake and Poyang Lake basin. Inter-annual and seasonal variations of the water discharge and sediment exchange processes between Changjiang River and Poyang Lake are systematically explored to determine the influence of climate change as well as human impact (especially the Three Gorges Dam (TGD)). Results indicate that climate variation for the Changjiang catchment and Poyang Lake watershed is the main factor determining the changes of water exchanges between Changjiang River and Poyang Lake. However, human activities (including the emplacement of the TGD) accelerated this rate of change. Relative to previous years (1956-1989), the water discharge outflow from Poyang lake during the dry season towards the Changjiang catchment increased by 8.98 km(3) y(-1) during 2003-2010. Evidently, the water discharge flowing into Poyang Lake during late April late May decreased. As a consequence, water storage of Poyang Lake significantly reduced during late April late May, resulting in frequent spring droughts after 2003. The freshwater flux of Changjiang River towards Poyang Lake is less during the flood season as well, significantly lowering the magnitude and frequency of the backflow of the Changjiang River during 2003-2010. Human activities, especially the emplacement and operation of the TGD and sand mining at Poyang Lake impose a major impact on the variation of sediment exchange between Changjiang main river and Poyang Lake. On average, sediments from Changjiang River deposited in Poyang Lake before 2000. After 2000, Changjiang River no longer supplied sediment to Poyang Lake. As a consequence, the sediment load of Changjiang River entering the sea increasingly exists of sediments from Lake Poyang during 2003-2010. As a result, Poyang Lake converted from a depositional to an erosional system, with a gross sediment loss of 120.19 Mt y(-1) during 2001-2010, including sand mining. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this network all grid cells in a catchment are coupled and have a flow direction, making it a useful tool in the modeling of river flow on a global scale. The flow directions are based on a digital elevation model and on information on the locations of major rivers ('stream burning'). The presented river routing network is specifically designed for the assessment of fresh water shortages. We tested the validity of the river routing network by comparing the computed drainage areas with published estimates. This comparison revealed a good similarity and it is concluded that the presented river routing network has sufficient quality to be implemented in global climate models. This could mean a considerable improvement of the surface parameterization in these models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

15,15,"Briggs, MA",Feb 23 2012 ,Using high-resolution distributed temperature sensing to quantify spatial and temporal variability in vertical hyporheic flux,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic flow can be extremely variable in space and time, and our understanding of complicated flow systems, such as exchange around small dams, has generally been limited to reach-averaged parameters or discrete point measurements. Emerging techniques are starting to fill the void between these disparate scales, increasing the utility of hyporheic research. When ambient diurnal temperature patterns are collected at high spatial resolution across vertical profiles in the streambed, the data can be applied to one-dimensional conduction-advection-dispersion models to quantitatively describe the vertical component of hyporheic flux at the same high spatial resolution. We have built on recent work by constructing custom fiber-optic distributed temperature sensors with 0.014 m spatial resolution that are robust enough to be installed by hand into the streambed, maintain high signal strength, and permit several sensors to be run in series off a single distributed temperature sensing unit. Data were collected continuously for 1 month above two beaver dams in a Wyoming stream to determine the spatial and temporal nature of vertical flux induced by the dams. Flux was organized by streambed morphology with strong, variable gradients with depth indicating a transition to horizontal flow across a spectrum of hyporheic flow paths. Several profiles showed contrasting temporal trends as discharge decreased by 45%. The high-resolution thermal sensors, combined with powerful analytical techniques, allowed a distributed quantitative description of the morphology-driven hyporheic system not previously possible.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000300824300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW02527%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2Bhigh-resolution%2Bdistributed%2Btemperature%2Bsensing%2Bto%2Bquantify%2Bspatial%2Band%2Btemporal%2Bvariability%2Bin%2Bvertical%2Bhyporheic%2Bflux%26rft.aufirst%3DMartin%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DBriggs%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011227%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DBriggs%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DLautz%252C%2BLK%26rft.au%3DHare%252C%2BDK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2011WR011227,,"RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,STREAM TEMPERATURE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,BED FORMS,WATER,SURFACE,EXCHANGE,HEAT,FLOW",,"Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Heroy Geol Lab 204, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA"
16,16,"Zahraeifard, V",Apr 2012 ,VART Model-Based Method for Estimation of Instream Dissolved Oxygen and Reaeration Coefficient,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Dissolved oxygen (DO) is essential to maintaining flora and fauna in aquatic ecosystems. The DO replenishment through the surface reaeration mechanism is commonly described using the reaeration coefficient (K-2). This paper presents a new approach to modeling instream DO and estimating K-2. The new approach includes an extension of the Variable Residence Time (VART) model and optimization algorithms for inverse modeling. The VART model is modified in this paper to incorporate the DO reaeration mechanism across the air-water interface, forming the VART-DO model. A major advantage of the VART-DO model is that it is capable of simulating DO exchange across the water-sediment interface through the hyporheic exchange mechanism in addition to the air-water exchange. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the relative importance of key model parameters to DO modeling. It is found that the K-2 value increases markedly with the dispersion coefficient. The simplex-simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm are used to optimize the estimation of the parameter K-2. A comparison of the optimized K-2 value from the VART-DO model with those from existing empirical equations reveals that K-2 value could increase 1.5 to 6 times when the effects of the dispersion and hyporheic exchange mechanisms on DO are taken into account. The results from the VART-DO model provide new insights into the DO variation in streams and rivers. The VART-DO model also provides a general and effective tool for total maximum daily load (TMDL) calculations of DO. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000494.

17,17,"Allen, GH",Feb 9 2018 ,Similarity of stream width distributions across headwater systems,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"The morphology and abundance of streams control the rates of hydraulic and biogeochemical exchange between streams, groundwater, and the atmosphere. In large river systems, the relationship between river width and abundance is fractal, such that narrow rivers are proportionally more common than wider rivers. However, in headwater systems, where many biogeochemical reactions are most rapid, the relationship between stream width and abundance is unknown. To constrain this uncertainty, we surveyed stream hydromorphology (wetted width and length) in several headwater stream networks across North America and New Zealand. Here, we find a strikingly consistent lognormal statistical distribution of stream width, including a characteristic most abundant stream width of 32 +/- 7 cm independent of discharge or physiographic conditions. We propose a hydromorphic model that can be used to more accurately estimate the hydromorphology of streams, with significant impact on the understanding of the hydraulic, ecological, and biogeochemical functions of stream networks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000424641200009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B610%26rft.atitle%3DSimilarity%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bwidth%2Bdistributions%2Bacross%2Bheadwater%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DGeorge%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DGH%26rft.aulast%3DAllen%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41467-018-02991-w%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2041-1723%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURE%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BCOMMUN%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DAllen%252C%2BGH%26rft.au%3DPavelsky%252C%2BTM%26rft.au%3DGleason%252C%2BCJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=NATURE+COMMUNICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1038/s41467-018-02991-w,,"CHANNEL GEOMETRY,CARBON-DIOXIDE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,NETWORKS,EXCHANGE,SIZE,AREA,EMISSIONS,ABUNDANCE,DISCHARGE",,"Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Geol Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA"

The goal of this study was to evaluate the impacts of storm events on thermal transport in the HZ. A year of temperature data were collected from six (6) multi-level samplers at multiple depths (30 cm, 60 cm, 90 cm and 150 cm) and were categorized into seasonal storm events. Analysis of the HZ temperature profiles revealed a seasonal reversal in the post-storm temperature change (Delta T) in the substrate. Increases in the Delta T were observed in the warm period (summer), whereas decreases occurred during the cold period (winter); both were associated with the direction of the pre-storm thermal gradient between the stream and substrate temperatures. The amplitude of Delta T became muted with increasing depth. Two-sample t-test analyses showed statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-storm temperatures at all depths during the warm period and at all depths except 150 cm in the cold period. Upwelling groundwater moderates the thermal response. There were no statistically significant differences in the pre- and post-storm stream temperatures during both the cold and warm periods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000579928700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2498%26rft.atitle%3DStorm%2BDriven%2BSeasonal%2BVariation%2Bin%2Bthe%2BThermal%2BResponse%2Bof%2Bthe%2BStreambed%2BWater%2Bof%2Ba%2BLow-Gradient%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DErasmus%2BK.%26rft.auinit%3DEK%26rft.aulast%3DOware%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12092498%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DOware%252C%2BEK%26rft.au%3DPeterson%252C%2BEW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w12092498,"hyporheic zone,thermal transport,storm-events,groundwater,surface-water interaction,thermal conditions","TIME-SERIES MEASUREMENTS,SURFACE-WATER,HYPORHEIC ZONE,TEMPERATURE PROFILES,SEDIMENT TEMPERATURE,AGRICULTURAL STREAM,EXCHANGE PROCESSES,RIVER TEMPERATURE,GROUNDWATER,HEAT",,"Illinois State Univ, Dept Geog Geol & Environm, Champaign, IL 61790 USA"
19,19,"Ledford, SH",Dec 1 2022 ,Connecting diverse disciplines to improve understanding of surface water-groundwater interactions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X,"Laura K. Lautz is a premier mentor, collaborator, and researcher at the intersection of natural hydrologic systems and humans. Her research has shifted the paradigm around measuring and understanding the impacts of surface water and groundwater interactions across spatial and temporal scales. She has done this by testing and refining new methods and by collaborating with, training, supporting, and mentoring diverse scientists. Here, we review her research across five themes, summarizing the prior status of the field, what Lautz contributed, as well as new directions in the field inspired by her work. Lautz's research expanded our understanding of the impacts of stream restoration on surface water-groundwater interactions, where she tested new field methods and showed that restoration structures increase hyporheic exchange, locally altering biogeochemical function of the streambed. She refined novel methods for measuring surface water-groundwater exchanges and worked to make these methods easily accessible through freely available software. Her research group greatly expanded the use of heat as a quantitative tracer of hydrologic processes via the well-used VFLUX and HFLUX programs. Her research evaluated the impacts of surface water-groundwater interactions in urban streams, showing the substantial fluxes of nutrients and chloride that can move through those exchanges and the potential for groundwater to help buffer contamination. To assess groundwater impacts on streamflow below tropical glaciers, she used a wide range of field methods to reveal the sensitivity of these systems to climate change. Finally, she built tools to quantify natural brine contamination of drinking water wells in areas that may later be subject to high-volume hydraulic fracturing, creating a needed 'pre-fracking' dataset. Through this process, she identified multiple sources of salinity that are already reaching wells in these systems. Overall, this research has been done with a focus on mentoring and training the next generation of hydrologists, including work to specifically train for careers beyond academia, and facilitating early career scientists to realize their innate potentials. With former trainees in careers across industry, government, and academia, Dr. Laura K. Lautz is now working to build cross-disciplinary research at even larger scales, across federal research units, guaranteeing that an even larger impact on hydrology is still to come.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000917654000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B100141%26rft.atitle%3DConnecting%2Bdiverse%2Bdisciplines%2Bto%2Bimprove%2Bunderstanding%2Bof%2Bsurface%2Bwater-groundwater%2Binteractions%26rft.aufirst%3DSarah%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DSH%26rft.aulast%3DLedford%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.hydroa.2022.100141%26rft.eissn%3D2589-9155%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%2BX%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%2BX%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DLedford%252C%2BSH%26rft.au%3DBriggs%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DZimmer%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY+X&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.hydroa.2022.100141,"surface water -groundwater,Stream restoration,Heat tracing,Urban streams,Hydraulic fracturing,Tropical glaciers","METHANE CONTAMINATION,CORDILLERA BLANCA,HYPORHEIC ZONE,DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS,PROGLACIAL VALLEYS,SPATIAL-PATTERNS,MARCELLUS SHALE,LOSING STREAM,HEAT,FLUX",,"Georgia State Univ, Dept Geosci, POB 3965, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA"

The energy budget adjusts radiation fluxes due to riparian shading and evapotranspiration, and propagates temperature downstream. Restorative cooling of the river can be simulated through algorithms for cool groundwater, either as direct inflows or by river water replacement called hyporheic exchange.

21,21,"Lackey, G",Jan 2015 ,Effects of Streambed Conductance on Stream Depletion,WATER,"Stream depletion, which is the reduction in flow rate of a stream or river due to the extraction of groundwater in a hydraulically connected stream-aquifer system, is often estimated using numerical models. The accuracy of these models depends on the appropriate parameterization of aquifer and streambed hydraulic properties. Streambed conductance is a parameter that relates the head difference between the stream and aquifer to flow across the stream channel. It is a function of streambed hydraulic conductivity and streambed geometry. In natural systems, streambed conductance varies spatially throughout the streambed; however, stream depletion modeling studies often ignore this variability. In this work, we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that stream depletion estimates are sensitive to a range of streambed conductance values depending on aquifer properties. We compare the stream depletion estimates from various spatial patterns of streambed conductance to show that modeling streambed conductance as a homogeneous property can lead to errors in stream depletion estimates. We use the results to identify feasible locations for proposed pumping wells such that the stream depletion due to pumping from a well within this feasible region would not exceed a prescribed threshold value, and we show that incorrect assumptions of the magnitude and spatial variability of streambed conductance can affect the size and shape of the feasible region.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000348401300016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2BStreambed%2BConductance%2Bon%2BStream%2BDepletion%26rft.aufirst%3DGreg%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DLackey%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw7010271%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.epage%3D287%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D271-287%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D271%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DLackey%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DNeupauer%252C%2BRM%26rft.au%3DPitlick%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w7010271,"stream depletion,streambed conductance,groundwater modeling","HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,AQUIFER INTERACTIONS,RIVER,FLOW,HETEROGENEITY,SEDIMENTS,DRAWDOWN,MODELS",,"Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, ECOT 441,428 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA"

Reversible sorption processes led to substantial retardation of many TrOCs along the investigated hyporheic flow path. Some TrOCs, such as dihydroxy-carbamazepine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, and venlafaxine, were found to be stable in the HZ. Others were readily removed with half-lives in the first 10 cm of the HZ ranging from 0.1 +/- 0.01 h for iopromide to 3.3 +/- 0.3 h for tramadol. Removal rate constants of the majority of reactive TrOCs were highest in the first 10 cm of the HZ, where removal of biodegradable dissolved organic matter was also the highest. Because conditions were oxic along the top 30 cm of the investigated flow path, we attribute this finding to the high microbial activity typically associated with the shallow HZ. Frequent and short vertical hyporheic exchange flows could therefore be more important for reach-scale TrOC removal than long, lateral hyporheic flow paths.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000465190300022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFate%2Bof%2BTrace%2BOrganic%2BCompounds%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%253A%2BInfluence%2Bof%2BRetardation%252C%2Bthe%2BBenthic%2BBiolayer%252C%2Band%2BOrganic%2BCarbon%26rft.aufirst%3DJonas%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DSchaper%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.est.8b06231%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D4234%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4224-4234%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4224%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DSchaper%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DPosselt%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/acs.est.8b06231,,"ANTIDIABETIC DRUG METFORMIN,TRANSFORMATION PRODUCT GUANYLUREA,SORPTION INFLUENCED TRANSPORT,BETA-BLOCKERS,PHARMACEUTICAL RESIDUES,ACTIVATED CARBON,BANK FILTRATION,WATER,MICROPOLLUTANTS,ATTENUATION",,"Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Dept Ecohydrol, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany"
23,23,"Wang, JY",Apr 2022 ,Characteristics of segmentation and interseismic coupling along the Red River fault from GPS observations,CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION,"The Red River fault is one of the important block boundary fault in Chuandian region. Therefore, it is great significance for studying the activity characteristics of different sections of the Red River fault to understand the movement characteristics of Chuandian region and the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. We obtained the current GPS velocity field near the Red River fault by using the GPS stations encrypted from 2014 to 2018 and combining with the GPS velocity field data in Chinese mainland from 1999 to 2016. Firstly, the study area can be divided into five relatively independent blocks by F test method : Southern China block, Daliangshan block, Chuanxibei block, Central Dian block and Southwest Dian block. Then, through the profile projection analysis of GPS velocity field, the Red River fault can be divided into three segments : the northern segment is from Eryuan to Midu, the middle segment is from Midu to Yuanjiang, and the southern segment is from Yuanjiang to Yuanyang. On these basis, the nearfield effects of Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault, Xiaojiang fault, Wuliangshan fault and Chuxiong-Jianshui fault in the Red River fault are considered in this paper, the slip rate and interseismic coupling degree of Red River fault, Lijiang-Xiaojinhe fault and Xiaojiang fault are inversed by using three-dimensional elastic block model and negative dislocation theory, and the model resolution is tested respectively. The results show that : (1) The northern segment of the Red River fault is completely locked 16 km below the surface, and the middle segment is completely locked 8 km below the surface; The locking degree of the southern segment is significantly weaker than that of the northern segment and the middle segment; the northern section of the Red River fault still has a high seismic risk. (2) The middle and southern section of the Red River fault may no longer act as the southwest boundary of the Central Dian block independently, but act as the block boundary together with the Wuliangshan fault and the Chuxiong-Jianshui fault, especially in the southern segment of the Red River fault. (3) The southern segment of the Red River fault is located in the transition zone from the Central Dian block to the Southern China block, and its motion characteristics have changed from the dextral srike-slip movement in the middle and northern segments to the sinistral strike-slip movement.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000779244500005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCharacteristics%2Bof%2Bsegmentation%2Band%2Binterseismic%2Bcoupling%2Balong%2Bthe%2BRed%2BRiver%2Bfault%2Bfrom%2BGPS%2Bobservations%26rft.aufirst%3Djunyi%26rft.auinit%3DJY%26rft.aulast%3DWang%2BJunYi%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.6038%252Fcjg2022P0174%26rft.epage%3D1254%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0001-5733%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DCHINESE%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICS-CHINESE%2BEDITION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1240-1254%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1240%26rft.stitle%3DCHINESE%2BJ%2BGEOPHYS-CH%26rft.volume%3D65%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BJY%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BCJ%26rft.au%3DXiao%252C%2BZH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=CHINESE+JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE+EDITION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.6038/cjg2022P0174,"Red River fault segmentation,Fault coupling,Slip rate,Model resolution",YUNNAN,,"Wuhan Univ, Sch Geodesy & Geomat, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China"
24,24,"Semiromi, MT",Jul 2020 ,"How Do Gaining and Losing Streams React to the Combined Effects of Climate Change and Pumping in the Gharehsoo River Basin, Iran?",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Projections of potential impacts of climate change and groundwater abstraction on gaining and losing streams, particularly in ephemeral river basins exhibiting sporadic and intricate flux exchanges, have remained largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a promising modeling scheme based on the new fully integrated hydrological model SWAT-MODFLOW-NWT, calibrated and validated for 1978-2012, to quantify the intertwined surface-groundwater interactions under a conjuncture of three climatic emission scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) and two groundwater pumping variants: ""pumping"" (extending current groundwater utilization into the future) and ""nonpumping"" (assuming a complete cease of pumping in the future). By forcing the integrated model with future downscaled climate predictors of CanESM2 under the aforementioned RCPs for three time slices up to year 2100, projections of various water resources components for the Gharehsoo River Basin (GRB), in northwestern Iran were made. Results demonstrate that because of a general decrease of future precipitation, though with ups and downs across the total projection period, most of the surface and -subsurface budget quantities and fluxes are substantially affected. In particular, future groundwater discharge (baseflow) to the gaining streams will be more influenced by the ""pumping"" variant (increasing and decreasing for ""nonpumping"" and ""pumping"", respectively) than the concentrated groundwater recharge from the losing streams (decreasing and increasing for ""nonpumping"" and ""pumping"", respectively). Future water yield and groundwater storage will also diminish and, surprisingly, this cannot be alleviated by future ""nonpumping"", indicating the groundwater overutilization is the compelling reason for the future water scarcity in the GRB, rather than climate change alone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000556141400014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR025388%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2BDo%2BGaining%2Band%2BLosing%2BStreams%2BReact%2Bto%2Bthe%2BCombined%2BEffects%2Bof%2BClimate%2BChange%2Band%2BPumping%2Bin%2Bthe%2BGharehsoo%2BRiver%2BBasin%252C%2BIran%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BTaie%26rft.auinit%3DMT%26rft.aulast%3DSemiromi%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025388%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DSemiromi%252C%2BMT%26rft.au%3DKoch%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR025388,"losing streams,gaining streams,climate change scenarios,baseflow,concentrated groundwater recharge,pumping variants","GROUNDWATER RECHARGE,CHANGE IMPACTS,CHANGE PROJECTIONS,SURFACE,MODEL,RESOURCES,PRECIPITATION,CATCHMENT,AREA,UNCERTAINTY",,"Univ Kassel, Dept Geohydraul & Engn Hydrol, Kassel, Germany"
25,25,"Pinardi, M",Nov 1 2022 ,Agricultural practices regulate the seasonality of groundwater-river nitrogen exchanges,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,"Soil System Budgets (SSB) of nutrients are generally performed annually over arable land to infer their use efficiency and water pollution risk in highly exploited agricultural watersheds. They are seldom partitioned into seasonal budgets and matched with seasonal nutrient transport in adjacent river reaches. We calculated seasonal soil nitrogen (N) budgets in a Mincio River sub-basin (Italy), and we analyzed the dissolved inorganic N net export in the river reach draining such sub-basin. Our results show seasonal differences of SSB with N excess in winter and even more in spring, equilibrium among sources and sinks during autumn and N deficit during summer. Seasonal inorganic N loads transported by the river were not correlated with SSB as they peaked in late summer and were at their minimum in early spring. Fertilization uncoupled to significant uptake supports N excess in winter and spring, whereas crop uptake uncoupled to N inputs supports summer N deficit. Nitrification cannot explain nitrate accumulation in the river reach, suggesting alternative dynamics driving the local hydrology. Flood irrigation results in large soil nitrate solubilization, transport and in upward migration of the groundwater piezometric head during spring and summer periods. River water is likely replaced by nitrate-rich groundwater when the groundwater recharge exceeds a certain threshold coinciding with late summer. Irrigation is then interrupted and the piezometric head, together with nitrate exchange, decreases. This work suggests that a deep understanding of N dynamics in agricultural watersheds with flooding irrigation on permeable soils needs the reconstruction of the vertical pathways of nitrate and of river-groundwater interactions. Moreover, the partitioning of annual into seasonal N budgets and their combination with irrigation practices allows the identification of hot moments in N cycling. Agricultural practices minimizing nitrate excess, its mobility and the risk of surface and groundwater pollution are suggested for this area.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000876856000004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B107904%26rft.atitle%3DAgricultural%2Bpractices%2Bregulate%2Bthe%2Bseasonality%2Bof%2Bgroundwater-river%2Bnitrogen%2Bexchanges%26rft.aufirst%3DMonica%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DPinardi%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.agwat.2022.107904%26rft.eissn%3D1873-2283%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0378-3774%26rft.jtitle%3DAGRICULTURAL%2BWATER%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAGR%2BWATER%2BMANAGE%26rft.volume%3D273%26rft.au%3DPinardi%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DSoana%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DBartoli%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=AGRICULTURAL+WATER+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107904,"Nitrogen,Retention,Transport,Loads,Irrigation,River-groundwater interaction","CLIMATE-CHANGE,ALLUVIAL AQUIFER,YANGTZE-RIVER,PO RIVER,NITRATE,BUDGETS,EXPORT,MANAGEMENT,CHINA,BASIN",,"Via A Corti 12, I-20133 Milan, Italy"
26,26,"Yi, YJ",Feb 2022 ,The impact of dams on the river connectivity of the two largest river basins in China,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Dams are built on rivers for power generation, flood prevention and control, and water resources utilization. However, dams also reduce the connectivity of rivers, which hinders the exchange of material and organisms within rivers. The Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin are the two largest river basins in China. In this study, the connectivity of these two huge and highly impacted systems was investigated. The Dendritic Connectivity Index (DCI) was applied to evaluate the impact on river connectivity of dams with a reservoir capacity of larger than 0.1 km(3). The results show that river connectivity decreased following an increase in dam construction. The connectivity of the Yangtze River Basin was close to 80 (0 is completely disconnected and 100 is connectivity under natural condition) in the 1980s, but declined significantly after the Gezhouba Dam was constructed on the mainstream of the Yangtze River. From 1980 to 2010, the connectivity of the Yellow River Basin was always lower than that of the Yangtze River Basin. The changes in the connectivity indices of potamodromous fish (DCIp) and diadromous fish (DCId) were determined for the period of 1980-2010. In the Yangtze River Basin, the DCIp decreased by 67.28% and the DCId decreased by 65.72%. In the Yellow River Basin, the DCIp decreased by 43.8% and the DCId decreased by 100%. In conclusion, the construction of dams, especially those on the main stream, has reduced the connectivity of the basin. The connectivity of the Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin has been severely affected.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000720821900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bimpact%2Bof%2Bdams%2Bon%2Bthe%2Briver%2Bconnectivity%2Bof%2Bthe%2Btwo%2Blargest%2Briver%2Bbasins%2Bin%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DYujun%26rft.auinit%3DYJ%26rft.aulast%3DYi%2BYujun%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.3892%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D193%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D185-193%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D185%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DYi%252C%2BYJ%26rft.au%3DGao%252C%2BYN%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BSH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/rra.3892,"biological passability,dams,dendritic connectivity index,river connectivity,Yangtze River Basin,Yellow River Basin","HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY,FISH PASSAGE",,"Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China"
27,27,"Laube, G",Jan 2022 ,"A systematic model-based evaluation of the influence of hydraulic conductivity, heterogeneity and domain depth on hyporheic nutrient transformation",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The hyporheic zone provides opportunities for the turnover and removal of nutrients such as ammonium and nitrate from stream water. Hyporheic flow patterns and dynamics govern the transport of nutrients and other solutes through the hyporheic zone and in turn control their transformation and removal. To better understand the links between flow and turnover, we systematically studied nutrient turnover rates with simulated sets of idealized streambed domains which varied in domain depth, hydraulic conductivity, its heterogeneity and anisotropy. We show that both aerobic (e.g. nitrification) and anaerobic (e.g. denitrification) turnover rates generally decrease monotonically with decreasing sediment conductivity at sufficiently large hyporheic zone depth. However, a reduction of the domain depth leads to an optimum of anaerobic turnover rates at intermediate conductivity due to the rate or transit time limitations of the reaction at the far ends of the conductivity range. Furthermore, conductivity heterogeneity generally lowers the turnover rates of both aerobic and anaerobic reactions. It is demonstrated how to reproduce this reduced nutrient turnover in heterogeneous sediments via a simplified anisotropy, which facilitates the prediction of turnover rates in heterogeneous sediments in certain cases. Our results foster the understanding of the interplay between hyporheic exchange and nutrient transformations and they aim to facilitate the conceptualization of large scale numerical simulations by demonstrating the effect of study design decisions like domain extent, heterogeneity and anisotropy.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000823133800003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B104087%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bsystematic%2Bmodel-based%2Bevaluation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%252C%2Bheterogeneity%2Band%2Bdomain%2Bdepth%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bnutrient%2Btransformation%26rft.aufirst%3DGerrit%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DLaube%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2021.104087%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D159%26rft.au%3DLaube%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DSchmidt%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DFleckenstein%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.advwatres.2021.104087,,"STREAM,EXCHANGE,ZONE,DENITRIFICATION,RESTORATION,FLOW",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Hydrogeol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany"
28,28,"Leach, JA",Aug 30 2017 ,Insights on stream temperature processes through development of a coupled hydrologic and stream temperature model for forested coastal headwater catchments,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream temperature controls a number of biological, chemical, and physical processes occurring in aquatic environments. Transient snow cover and advection associated with lateral throughflow inputs can have a dominant influence on stream thermal regimes for headwater catchments in the rain-on-snow zone. Most existing stream temperature models lack the ability to properly simulate these processes. We developed and evaluated a conceptual-parametric catchment-scale stream temperature model that includes the role of transient snow cover and lateral advection associated with throughflow. The model consists of routines for simulating canopy interception, snow accumulation and melt, hillslope throughflow runoff and temperature, and stream channel energy exchange processes. The model was used to predict discharge and stream temperature for a small forested headwater catchment near Vancouver, Canada, using long-term (1963-2013) weather data to compute model forcing variables. The model was evaluated against 4 years of observed stream temperature. The model generally predicted daily mean stream temperature accurately (annual RMSE between 0.57 and 1.24 degrees C) although it overpredicted daily summer stream temperatures by up to 3 degrees C during extended low streamflow conditions. Model development and testing provided insights on the roles of advection associated with lateral throughflow, channel interception of snow, and surface-subsurface water interactions on stream thermal regimes.

The geochemical profile of streambed piston-cored sediments and the solute concentrations of the hyporheic pore water and surface water were also determined. Sediments are characterized by high concentrations of As, Cd, Tl, Sb, Ni, Cu, Zn, besides Al, Mn, and Fe. The As and Fe are closely coupled, indicating that iron oxyhydroxide precipitation plays a major role in controlling As sequestration. Mn oxides likely act as a sorbent for Zn, Ni, Sb, and Pb. Downstream geochemical trends indicate that precipitation and sorption represent the natural attenuation processes controlling the PTE loading released from the contaminated acidic effluents. The obtained results highlight that the Baccatoio stream sediments may act as secondary pollution sources via redox cycling, allowing contaminant remobilization to surface- and ground-water across the streambed, affecting the stream environment and aquatic biota.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000666813800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGeochemistry%2Bof%2BMine%2BStream%2BSediments%2Band%2Bthe%2BControl%2Bon%2BPotentially%2BToxic%2BElement%2BMigration%253A%2BA%2BCase%2BStudy%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BBaccatoio%2BBasin%2B%2528Tuscany%252C%2BItaly%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DLisa%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DGhezzi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10230-021-00789-9%26rft.eissn%3D1616-1068%26rft.epage%3D735%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1025-9112%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DMINE%2BWATER%2BAND%2BTHE%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D722-735%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D722%26rft.stitle%3DMINE%2BWATER%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DGhezzi%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DBuccianti%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DPetrini%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=MINE+WATER+AND+THE+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10230-021-00789-9,"Past-mining,Stream sediments,Trace elements,Apuan Alps","APUAN ALPS,HYPORHEIC ZONE,NATURAL ATTENUATION,RIVER SEDIMENTS,HEAVY-METALS,DRAINAGE,IRON,ADSORPTION,EXCHANGE,PYRITE",,"Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via S Maria 53, I-56126 Pisa, Italy"

MHYSER 1.0 is a semi-two-dimensional model using the stream tubes concept to achieve lateral variations of velocity, flow stresses, and sediment transport rate. This is a new tool to address rivers' natural hazards predictions. The sediment routing and bed adjustments calculations are accomplished separately along each stream tube taking into account lateral mass exchanges. To test the model behaviors, MHYSER 1.0 is applied to four test cases. The first example is used to perform water surface profile calculations without sediment transport. The second problem shows MHYSER 1.0 performances regarding movable river beds. For the third application, MHYSER 1.0 is applied to a reach of the Ha! Ha! River (Quebec, Canada), a tributary of the Saguenay River, for the 1996 ""downpour.'' The results show a very good correlation of results with those collected in situ. Finally, an application to a reach of the Outaouais River (Quebec, Canada) shows the use of riverbank stability option to produce the risk area in case of a dam break occurrence upstream.

Then, the author tests hypotheses with state-level implementation of federal environmental policy over a 20 year period. Using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), the author makes joint estimations of policymaking and policy implementation as separate, correlated processes. Findings indicate how politics affects policymaking and policy implementation is conditional on existing policies and problems, and that these two processes are not independent from each other.

32,32,"Doeblin, D",May 2022 ,Utilizing social science data from river recreationists to inform river management,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"River recreation often contributes to ecological degradation - a primary concern for river management professionals. Using social science data to inform ecological management helps mitigate recreational impacts, particularly at sites that experience high recreation use. This paper demonstrates the utility of an approach to collect, display, and use social data based on an indicators and thresholds approach at Buffalo National River in Arkansas (BUFF). Specifically, we presented a series of digitally manipulated photographs to river recreationists at BUFF that depicted varying levels of use, or density of use, to identify social thresholds - the levels of use deemed unacceptable by river users. We coupled the photos with quantitative questionnaires and found that paddlers, anglers, and campers thought that moderate to high-density levels were unacceptable. Pairing such data with empirical evidence of ecological degradation born from recreation use (e.g., erosion, water quality issues) provides a robust and defensible justification for a range of management actions, including altering use levels and river access. The research methods presented in this paper are transferable to a range of high-use rivers and waterways, and thus provide a blueprint for river professionals who by design or default interface with recreation and ecological resources. In the end, combining social and ecological data can fortify management decisions and decrease associated conflicts among important groups of river recreationists.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000749352400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUtilizing%2Bsocial%2Bscience%2Bdata%2Bfrom%2Briver%2Brecreationists%2Bto%2Binform%2Briver%2Bmanagement%26rft.aufirst%3DDylan%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DDoeblin%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.3945%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D798%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D788-798%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D788%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DDoeblin%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DBrunson%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DBrownlee%252C%2BMTJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/rra.3945,"normative theory,protected area management,river management,social science","NORMS,QUALITY,IMPACTS",,"Kansas State Univ, Pk Management & Conservat, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA"

They are used as solvents and coating materials in personal care products, cleaning materials and industrial applications. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the spatial variations of VMS levels in river water and ambient air in Kucuk Menderes Basin and their air-water exchange patterns. Grab river water samples and passive ambient air samples collected from 10 sites throughout Kucuk Menderes Basin located in Izmir region in Turkey, and they were analyzed for VMS. The concentrations of Sigma VMS in river water and ambient air ranged from 48.4 to 148 ng L-1 and from 41.7 to 433 ng m(-3), respectively. Among the VMS compounds, the predominant compounds were found to be D5 and D3 in ambient air and river water, respectively. In general, concentrations of all VMS congeners increased towards downstream of the river for both water and ambient air samples and there were substantial fluctuations between the sampling points. These fluctuations may be due to wastewater discharges at some sites (increase), followed by loss by volatilization along the river (decrease). VMS concentrations measured in air and river water samples were used to estimate the net air-water exchange fluxes. In all cases, fluxes were negative, ranging between -159 (L4) and -11100 (D3) ng m(-2) day, indicating volatilization from water is a source for atmospheric VMS.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000593929700006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Bvariations%2Bof%2Blinear%2Band%2Bcyclic%2Bvolatile%2Bmethyl%2Bsiloxanes%2Bin%2Ba%2Briver%2Bbasin%2Band%2Btheir%2Bair-water%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DBaris%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DYaman%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.apr.2020.06.005%26rft.epage%3D2316%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1309-1042%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DATMOSPHERIC%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2308-2316%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2308%26rft.stitle%3DATMOS%2BPOLLUT%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DYaman%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DErkuzu%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DOdabasi%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=ATMOSPHERIC+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.apr.2020.06.005,"Volatile methyl siloxanes,River water,Air-water exchange,Fugacity fraction","POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS,IZMIR BAY,PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES,TREATMENT PLANTS,COASTAL SITE,METHYLSILOXANES,SOILS,FATE,NAPHTHALENES,DEPOSITION",,"Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Izmir, Turkey"
34,34,"Boulton, AJ",2006 ,"Rivers as groundwater-dependent ecosystems: a review of degrees of dependency, riverine processes and management implications",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,"Many rivers are classified as groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs), owing to the contribution of groundwater to their base flow. However, there has been little explicit recognition of the way groundwater influences riverine biota or processes, how degrees of ecological dependency may vary, and the management implications of this dependency. The permeable beds and banks of these GDEs where surface water and groundwater exchange are termed 'hyporheic zones'. They are often inhabited by invertebrates, with varying reliance on groundwater, although the ecological roles of these invertebrates are little known. Upwelling hyporheic water can promote surface primary productivity, influence sediment microbial activity, and affect organic matter decomposition. In many intermittent streams, variable groundwater inputs alter the duration of flow or water permanence, and the duration and timing of these largely govern the biota and rates of many ecosystem processes ( e. g. leaf decomposition). Not only is the physical presence of water important, thermal and chemical conditions arising from groundwater inputs also have direct and indirect effects on riverine biota and rates or types of in-stream processes. Differing degrees of dependency of rivers on groundwater mediate all these influences, and may change over time and in response to human activities. Alteration of groundwater inputs through extraction from riparianwells or changes in localwater table have an impact on these GDEs, and some current management plans aim to restrict groundwater extraction from near permeable river channels. However, these are often 'blanket' restrictions and the mechanisms of GDE dependency or timing of groundwater requirements are poorly understood, hampering refinement of this management approach. More effective management of these GDEs into the future can result only from a better understanding of the mechanisms of the dependency, how these vary among river types and what in-stream changes might be predicted from alteration of groundwater inputs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000236550600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRivers%2Bas%2Bgroundwater-dependent%2Becosystems%253A%2Ba%2Breview%2Bof%2Bdegrees%2Bof%2Bdependency%252C%2Briverine%2Bprocesses%2Band%2Bmanagement%2Bimplications%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FBT05074%26rft.epage%3D144%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0067-1924%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DAUSTRALIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BBOTANY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D133-144%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D133%26rft.stitle%3DAUST%2BJ%2BBOT%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DHancock%252C%2BPJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=AUSTRALIAN+JOURNAL+OF+BOTANY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1071/BT05074,,"DESERT STREAM ECOSYSTEM,FLOW VARIABILITY,HYPORHEIC ZONE,SURFACE-WATER,MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES,FLOODPLAIN HABITATS,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,DOMINATED STREAM,SPAWNING STREAM,CHALK STREAM",,"Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia"
35,35,"Rasera, MDFL",Dec 2013 ,Spatial and temporal variability of pCO(2) and CO2 efflux in seven Amazonian Rivers,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Current estimates of CO2 outgassing from Amazonian rivers and streams have considerable uncertainty since they are based on limited-time surveys of pCO(2) measurements along the Amazon mainstem and mouths of major tributaries, using conservative estimates of gas exchange velocities. In order to refine basin-scale CO2 efflux estimates from Amazonian rivers, we present a long time (5-year) dataset of direct measurements of CO2 fluxes, gas transfer velocities and pCO(2) measurements in seven representative rivers of the lowland Amazon basin fluvial network, six non-tidal (Negro, Solimes, Teles Pires, Cristalino, Araguaia and Java,s) and one tidal river (Caxiuan), with sizes ranging from 4th to 9th order. Surveys were conducted from January 2006 to December 2010, in a total of 389 campaigns covering all stages of their hydrographs. CO2 fluxes and gas transfer velocities (k) were measured using floating chambers and pCO(2) was measured simultaneously by headspace extraction followed by gas chromatography analysis. Results show high CO2 flux rate variability among rivers and hydrograph stages, ranging from -0.8 to 15.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), with unexpected negative fluxes in clear-water rivers during low waters. Non-tidal rivers showed marked seasonal CO2 flux patterns, with significantly higher exchange during high waters. Seasonality was modulated by pCO(2), which was positive and strongly correlated with discharge. In these rivers k was well correlated with wind speed, which allowed the use of wind data to model k. We estimate a release of 360 +/- A 60 Tg C year(-1) from Amazonian rivers and streams within a 1.47 million km(2) quadrant in the central lowland Amazon. Extrapolating these values to the basin upstream of A""bidos, results in an outgassing of 0.8 Pg C to the atmosphere each year.

36,36,"Kokic, J",2018 ,High spatial variability of gas transfer velocity in streams revealed by turbulence measurements,INLAND WATERS,"Streams are major sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but current large-scale estimates are associated with high uncertainties because knowledge concerning the spatiotemporal control on stream emissions is limited. One of the largest uncertainties derives from the choice of gas transfer velocity (k(600)), which describes the physical efficiency of gas exchange across the water-atmosphere interface. This study therefore explored the variability in k(600 )and subsequent CO2 and CH4 emission rates within and across streams of different stream order (SO). We conducted, for the first time in streams, direct turbulence measurements using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) to determine the spatial variability in k(600) across a variety of scales with a consistent methodology. The results show high spatial variability in k(600) and corresponding CO2 and CH4 emissions at small spatial scales, both within stream reaches and across SO, especially during high discharge. The k(600) was positively related to current velocity and Reynolds number. By contrast, no clear relationship was found between k(600) and specific stream characteristics such as width and depth, which are parameters often used in empirical models of k(600). Improved understanding of the small-scale variability in the physical properties along streams, especially during high discharge, is therefore an important step to reduce the uncertainty in existing gas transfer models and emissions for stream systems. The ADV method was a useful tool for revealing spatial variability in this work, but it needs further development. We recommend that future studies conduct measurements over shorter time periods (e.g., 10-15 min instead of 40 min) and at more sites across the reach of interest, and thereby derive more reliable mean-reach k(600) as well as more information about controls on the spatial variability in k(600).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000456214700006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHigh%2Bspatial%2Bvariability%2Bof%2Bgas%2Btransfer%2Bvelocity%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Brevealed%2Bby%2Bturbulence%2Bmeasurements%26rft.aufirst%3DJovana%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DKokic%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F20442041.2018.1500228%26rft.eissn%3D2044-205X%26rft.epage%3D473%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2044-2041%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DINLAND%2BWATERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D461-473%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D461%26rft.stitle%3DINLAND%2BWATERS%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DKokic%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DSahlee%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DWallin%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=INLAND+WATERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/20442041.2018.1500228,"biogeochemistry,gas exchange,spatial variability,streams","CARBON-DIOXIDE,1ST-ORDER STREAM,EXCHANGE RATES,FLUX CHAMBERS,WIND-SPEED,EMISSIONS,SURFACE,CO2,EVASION,CH4",,"Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Program Air Water & Landscape Sci, Uppsala, Sweden"
37,37,"Naranjo, RC",Jun 2013 ,Using heat as a tracer to estimate spatially distributed mean residence times in the hyporheic zone of a riffle-pool sequence,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Biochemical reactions that occur in the hyporheic zone are highly dependent on the time solutes that are in contact with sediments of the riverbed. In this investigation, we developed a 2-D longitudinal flow and solute-transport model to estimate the spatial distribution of mean residence time in the hyporheic zone. The flow model was calibrated using observations of temperature and pressure, and the mean residence times were simulated using the age-mass approach for steady-state flow conditions. The approach used in this investigation includes the mixing of different ages and flow paths of water through advection and dispersion. Uncertainty of flow and transport parameters was evaluated using standard Monte Carlo and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method. Results of parameter estimation support the presence of a low-permeable zone in the riffle area that induced horizontal flow at a shallow depth within the riffle area. This establishes shallow and localized flow paths and limits deep vertical exchange. For the optimal model, mean residence times were found to be relatively long (9-40.0 days). The uncertainty of hydraulic conductivity resulted in a mean interquartile range (IQR) of 13 days across all piezometers and was reduced by 24% with the inclusion of temperature and pressure observations. To a lesser extent, uncertainty in streambed porosity and dispersivity resulted in a mean IQR of 2.2 and 4.7 days, respectively. Alternative conceptual models demonstrate the importance of accounting for the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in simulating mean residence times in a riffle-pool sequence.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000322241300044,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2Bheat%2Bas%2Ba%2Btracer%2Bto%2Bestimate%2Bspatially%2Bdistributed%2Bmean%2Bresidence%2Btimes%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Briffle-pool%2Bsequence%26rft.aufirst%3DRamon%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DRC%26rft.aulast%3DNaranjo%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20306%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D3711%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3697-3711%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3697%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DNaranjo%252C%2BRC%26rft.au%3DPohll%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DMckay%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20306,"residence time,uncertainty,hyporheic zone,heat as a tracer","GROUNDWATER-FLOW MODEL,UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT,DIRECT SIMULATION,BED FORMS,STREAM,EXCHANGE,WATER,AQUIFER,AGE,SURFACE",,"US Geol Survey, 2730 N Deer Run Rd, Carson City, NV 89701 USA"
38,38,"Shi, Q",Jun 2 2019 ,Coupling Ocean Currents and Waves with Wind Stress over the Gulf Stream,REMOTE SENSING,"This study provides the first detailed analysis of oceanic and atmospheric responses to the current-stress, wave-stress, and wave-current-stress interactions around the Gulf Stream using a high-resolution three-way coupled regional modeling system. In general, our results highlight the substantial impact of coupling currents and/or waves with wind stress on the air-sea fluxes over the Gulf Stream. The stress and the curl of the stress are crucial to mixed-layer energy budgets and sea surface temperature. In the wave-current-stress coupled experiment, wind stress increased by 15% over the Gulf Stream. Alternating positive and negative bands of changes of Ekman-related vertical velocity appeared in response to the changes of the wind stress curl along the Gulf Stream, with magnitudes exceeding 0.3 m/day (the 95th percentile). The response of wind stress and its curl to the wave-current-stress coupling was not a linear combination of responses to the wave-stress coupling and the current-stress coupling because the ocean and wave induced changes in the atmosphere showed substantial feedback on the ocean. Changes of a latent heat flux in excess of 20 W/m(2) and a sensible heat flux in excess of 5 W/m(2) were found over the Gulf Stream in all coupled experiments. Sensitivity tests show that sea surface temperature (SST) induced difference of air-sea humidity is a major contributor to latent heat flux (LHF) change. Validation is challenging because most satellite observations lack the spatial resolution to resolve the current-induced changes in wind stress curls and heat fluxes. Scatterometer observations can be used to examine the changes in wind stress across the Gulf Stream. The conversion of model data to equivalent neutral winds is highly dependent on the physics considered in the air-sea turbulent fluxes, as well as air-sea temperature differences. This sensitivity is shown to be large enough that satellite observations of winds can be used to test the flux parameterizations in coupled models.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000473794600082,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1476%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BOcean%2BCurrents%2Band%2BWaves%2Bwith%2BWind%2BStress%2Bover%2Bthe%2BGulf%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DQi%26rft.auinit%3DQ%26rft.aulast%3DShi%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Frs11121476%26rft.eissn%3D2072-4292%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DREMOTE%2BSENSING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DREMOTE%2BSENS-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DShi%252C%2BQ%26rft.au%3DBourassa%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=REMOTE+SENSING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/rs11121476,"ocean currents,waves,wind stress,air-sea heat fluxes,three-way coupling,satellite wind data","SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE,BOUNDARY-LAYER STRUCTURE,DRAG COEFFICIENT,HEAT FLUXES,PART I,MODEL,ATMOSPHERE,PARAMETERIZATION,DEPENDENCE,PACIFIC",,"Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Predicat Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA"
39,39,"Griebling, SA",Aug 2013 ,Adjoint modeling of stream depletion in groundwater-surface water systems,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Groundwater pumping may lead to reduction in surface water flows, which can compromise water supplies and habitat. In light of these threats, the need to minimize stream depletion, defined as the reduction in the flow rate in streams and rivers caused by groundwater pumping, becomes paramount. We develop adjoint equations to calculate stream depletion due to aquifer pumping. We consider a coupled groundwater and surface water system in which both the river head and river flow rate are impacted by drawdown in the aquifer as a result of pumping. Through an illustrative example, we show that the adjoint method for calculating stream depletion produces accurate results if the model is approximately linear. With only one simulation of the adjoint equations, stream depletion can be calculated for pumping at a well at any location in the model domain, which results in a substantial reduction in computational time as compared to the standard method of calculating stream depletion.Key Points  Adjoint models accurately calculate stream depletion due to aquifer pumping. The adjoint method is computationally efficient in calculating stream depletion.

40,40,"Lavelle, AM",Aug 2021 ,Effects of Habitat Restoration on Fish Communities in Urban Streams,WATER,"Geomorphological alterations, hydrological disconnectivity and water pollution are among the dominant pressures affecting ecological integrity in urban streams. River restoration approaches often involve utilising in-stream structures to encourage flow heterogeneity and promote habitat diversity. However, few studies examine the success of such projects. In this study, fish density, biomass and community structure at paired restored and unrestored reaches across five tributaries of the River Thames were examined. Fish density varied among rivers and reaches but was generally higher at restored sites. Restored sites also exhibited higher overall fish biomass, attributed mainly to the presence of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) at the River Wandle. Despite higher density and biomass values at restored sites, the community structure analysis did not identify strong links between either river or restoration status using either species-specific density or biomass. Our results highlight that although reach-scale restoration can lead to localised increases in species density and biomass, this may chiefly be due to aggregation owing to preferential habitats created through restoration activities at these sites. Over larger spatial scales, significant improvements to species richness and diversity are likely to be limited due to the poor water quality and disconnected nature of these urban streams. Whilst reach-scale restoration clearly has the potential to provide preferential habitats for fish species, future efforts should focus on improving connectivity for fish across the wider Thames basin network by removing barriers to passage, improving water quality, restoring watershed processes and creating well-connected, diverse habitats which can facilitate the survival of a wide array of fish species throughout their life cycle.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000690153600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2170%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2BHabitat%2BRestoration%2Bon%2BFish%2BCommunities%2Bin%2BUrban%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAnna%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DLavelle%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw13162170%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D16%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DLavelle%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DChadwick%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DBury%252C%2BNR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w13162170,"urban rivers,urban fish communities,river restoration,River Thames catchment","RIVER RESTORATION,SALMONID ABUNDANCE,COTTUS-GOBIO,REHABILITATION,CONNECTIVITY,POPULATIONS,BULLHEAD,PROJECTS,FAILURE,ECOLOGY",,"Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, Bush House,North East Wing,40 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England"

42,42,"Marr, KR",Mar 15 2017 ,"Chemical weathering trends in fine-grained ephemeral stream sediments of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"We investigated chemical weathering trends within the fine-grained (<63 mu m; silt and clay) fraction of sediments collected from meltwater streams emanating from glaciers in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV; Wright and Taylor Valleys) by integrating grain size, BET surface area, and whole-rock geochemistry. While both valleys currently host cold-based glaciers, the sediment underlying the ephemeral glacial streams was deposited under differing glacial conditions. In Wright Valley (Clark Glacier stream), Brownworth and Trilogy drifts were deposited via cold-based glaciation, whereas the Ross Sea drift that underlies Delta Stream in Taylor Valley likely reflects contributions from wet-based ice. Wright Valley stream sediments are typically coarser grained and have a higher silt content as compared to Taylor Valley sediments. These sediments consist primarily of pyroxenes, quartz, and feldspars, with the percentages of pyroxenes and quartz systematically increasing downstream. The percentage of phyllosilicates ranges from 4 to 18% and decreases with downstream distance. In contrast, Taylor Valley sediments (Delta Stream) are finer-grained and exhibit lower percentages of both pyroxene and quartz and a significantly higher percentage of phyllosilicates (30-43%). Concentrations of all mineral phases remain relatively consistent in abundance with downstream transport in the Delta Stream transect as compared to Clark Glacier stream sediments. Standard chemical weathering indices, such as the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), indicate that chemical weathering is occurring within the silt and clay fractions of Antarctic stream sediments and is particularly pronounced in Delta Stream sediments that have BET surface area measurements >40 m(2)/g. Utilization of MFW (mafic-felsic-weathered) and A-CN-K (Al2O3-CaO + Na2O-K2O plots, however, are more effective in discerning the extent and nature of chemical weathering in these stream systems. Ca and Na depletion observed within the sediments exhibiting the highest surface area in Delta Stream suggest that chemical weathering may result in pitting and/or incongruent dissolution of pyroxenes and feldspars, as well as the development of amorphous and/or nanophase weathering products. In contrast, Clark Glacier stream sediments do not have similar leaching trends in the fine-grained sediment fraction and exhibit minimal weathering overall. This may suggest that fine-grained material is being trapped on top of the Clark Glacier surface and has not yet been transported into the weathering environment of the hyporheic zone due to timing of sampling. Alternatively, complete dissolution of very fine-grained sediment could be occurring in this stream transect, and is therefore not preserved in the fine sediment fraction. Overall, the magnitude of chemical weathering observed between the two stream systems is ultimately related to the nature of the underlying drift (cold and wet based drift deposition), dispersal patterns of eolian fines, and variable stream discharge rates. Thus, incorporation of local fine-grained sediment derived from the underlying glacial drift deposits and distributed via the varying wind regimes within the hyper-arid climate into active stream channels may facilitate incongruent mineral dissolution and development of weathering products, and ultimately influence the composition and concentration of meltwater stream solutes.

43,43,"Graham, EB",Apr 2017 ,Deterministic influences exceed dispersal effects on hydrologically-connected microbiomes,ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Subsurface groundwater-surface water mixing zones (hyporheic zones) have enhanced biogeochemical activity, but assembly processes governing subsurface microbiomes remain a critical uncertainty in understanding hyporheic biogeochemistry. To address this obstacle, we investigated (a) biogeographical patterns in attached and waterborne microbiomes across three hydrologically-connected, physicochemically-distinct zones (inland hyporheic, nearshore hyporheic and river); (b) assembly processes that generated these patterns; (c) groups of organisms that corresponded to deterministic changes in the environment; and (d) correlations between these groups and hyporheic metabolism. All microbiomes remained dissimilar through time, but consistent presence of similar taxa suggested dispersal and/or common selective pressures among zones. Further, we demonstrated a pronounced impact of deterministic assembly in all microbiomes as well as seasonal shifts from heterotrophic to autotrophic microorganisms associated with increases in groundwater discharge. The abundance of one statistical cluster of organisms increased with active biomass and respiration, revealing organisms that may strongly influence hyporheic biogeochemistry. Based on our results, we propose a conceptualization of hyporheic zone metabolism in which increased organic carbon concentrations during surface water intrusion support heterotrophy, which succumbs to autotrophy under groundwater discharge. These results provide new opportunities to enhance microbially-explicit ecosystem models describing hyporheic zone biogeochemistry and its influence over riverine ecosystem function.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000398855400016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDeterministic%2Binfluences%2Bexceed%2Bdispersal%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bhydrologically-connected%2Bmicrobiomes%26rft.aufirst%3DEmily%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DEB%26rft.aulast%3DGraham%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1462-2920.13720%26rft.eissn%3D1462-2920%26rft.epage%3D1567%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1462-2912%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMICROBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1552-1567%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1552%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMICROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DGraham%252C%2BEB%26rft.au%3DCrump%252C%2BAR%26rft.au%3DStegen%252C%2BJC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MICROBIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/1462-2920.13720,,"SOIL BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES,HYPORHEIC ZONE,ASSEMBLY PROCESSES,CURRENT KNOWLEDGE,ORGANIC-MATTER,ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION,BETA-DIVERSITY,STREAM,GROUNDWATER,ECOLOGY",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Div Biol Sci, Richland, WA 99354 USA"

We tested the prediction that fish dispersal influences local fish community structure and bioassessment metrics as a function of site position within stream networks. We evaluated fish community data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Regional Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in West Virginia, USA, to compare the influences of stream network position, ecoregion, basin, and stream size on local fish community composition. We assigned sites to 1 of 3 stream network positions: 1) main channels (MC, n = 12) encompassed streams with upstream catchment areas >200 km(2), 2) mainstem tributaries (MT, n = 43) flowed into MC-sized confluences within 15 fluvial km, 3) headwater tributaries (HT, n = 31) lacked such riverine confluences within 15 fluvial km. MT and HT sites had similar upstream catchment sizes and landuse gradients, but species richness was greater in MT sites than HT sites, whereas MT and MC sites were not different in this regard. Three bioassessment metrics were greater in MT sites than HT sites (intolerant species richness, cyprinid species richness, benthic species richness), but a multimetric index of biotic integrity did not differ among stream network positions. Ordinations revealed that fish community composition was organized primarily by zoogeographic basin (Monongahela River basin, New River basin, Ohio River basin), ecoregion (Central Appalachian Plateau, Western Appalachian Plateau, Ridge and Valley), and stream size. Riverine specialists were more abundant in MT than HT sites and were more abundant in basins connected to the Ohio River than in basins isolated from the Ohio River by a large waterfall (New River). Our results suggest that contemporary dispersal among streams influences fish community composition over small spatial scales (10(1) km), historical dispersal constrained by zoogeographic barriers influences community structure over larger areas (10(2) km), and contemporary dispersal by fishes influences certain metrics commonly used in bioassessment programs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000287114800024,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFish%2Bcommunity%2Band%2Bbioassessment%2Bresponses%2Bto%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%2Bposition%26rft.aufirst%3DNathaniel%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DNP%26rft.aulast%3DHitt%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F09-155.1%26rft.epage%3D309%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D296-309%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D296%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D30%26rft.au%3DHitt%252C%2BNP%26rft.au%3DAngermeier%252C%2BPL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1899/09-155.1,"fish community,dispersal,stream network,bioassessment,metacommunity,zoogeography","SPECIES-AREA RELATIONSHIP,ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE,BIOTIC INTEGRITY,WEST-VIRGINIA,SPATIAL POSITION,RIVER,MOVEMENT,HABITAT,CLASSIFICATION,CONNECTIVITY",,"US Geol Survey, Leetown Sci Ctr, Aquat Ecol Branch, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA"

However, global lake water resources showed a depleting tendency over the past decades because of the climate change and human activities. To mitigate the drought of lakes linked to a regulated main river, this study proposes an integrated scheduling-assessing system (ISAS) based on the machine learning methodology for a large river-lake system controlled by upstream reservoirs. Closely calibrated to observational data, the ISAS was applied to the middle Yangtze River to mitigate the Poyang Lake drought. The results show that the drought situation in the downstream lake could be improved through the reservoir optimal operation. For the Poyang Lake case, the lowest lake level is not obviously improved, while the starting data of the drought could be delayed by 12, 11, and 17 days, comparing to the conventional scheme in typical dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. Moreover, the duration of the drought could be 20, 19, and 21 days less. It is illustrated that accelerating the reservoir filling speed and decelerating the emptying speed is beneficial to alleviate the drought situation of downstream river-connected lakes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000806370400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B114999%26rft.atitle%3DIntegrated%2Bscheduling-assessing%2Bsystem%2Bfor%2Bdrought%2Bmitigation%2Bin%2Bthe%2Briver-connected%2Blake%26rft.aufirst%3DPeipei%26rft.auinit%3DPP%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jenvman.2022.114999%26rft.eissn%3D1095-8630%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0301-4797%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BMANAGE%26rft.volume%3D313%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BPP%26rft.au%3DMao%252C%2BJQ%26rft.au%3DDai%252C%2BHC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114999,"Scheduling -assessing system,Drought mitigation,Data driven,River -lake system,Reservoir operation","POYANG LAKE,ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS,YANGTZE-RIVER,WATER,OPTIMIZATION,MANAGEMENT,DAM",,"Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China"

These effects involve potential threats over surface water and groundwater quantity and quality. As a result, the description of stream-aquifer flow in space and time is of high interest for water managers. In this study, the EauDyssee platform, an integrated groundwater/surface water model is extended to provide the distribution of stream-aquifer flow at the regional scale. The methodology is implemented over long periods (17 years) in the Seine river basin (76 375 km(2), France) with a 6 481 km long simulated river network. The study scale is compatible with the scale of interest of water authorities, which is often larger than study scales of research projects. Net and gross stream-aquifer exchange flow are computed at the daily time step over the whole river network at a resolution of 1 km. Simulation results highlight that a major proportion of the main stream network (82 %) is supplied by groundwater. Groundwater withdrawals induce a reduction of net aquifer-to-stream flow (-19 %) at the basin scale and flow reversals in the vicinity of pumping locations. Such an integrated model provided at the appropriate regional scale is an essential tool provided to water managers for the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000346417700009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DReporting%2Bof%2BStream-Aquifer%2BFlow%2BDistribution%2Bat%2Bthe%2BRegional%2BScale%2Bwith%2Ba%2BDistributed%2BProcess-Based%2BModel%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DPryet%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-014-0832-7%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1650%26rft.epage%3D159%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D139-159%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D139%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DPryet%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DLabarthe%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DFlipo%252C%2BN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11269-014-0832-7,"Surface water - groundwater interactions,Regional modeling,Distributed process-based hydrological model,Seine river basin,European water framework directive","1ST-ORDER EXCHANGE COEFFICIENT,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,CHANGE IMPACTS,RIVER,BASIN,TOOLS,IMPLEMENTATION,HETEROGENEITY,AGRICULTURE,SENSITIVITY",,"Inst Polytech Bordeaux, ENSEGID, EA Georessources & Environm 4592, 1 Allee Fernand Daguin, F-33607 Pessac, France"
48,48,"Stromberg, JC",Aug 2016 ,"Riparian plant guilds of ephemeral, intermittent and perennial rivers",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Plant functional types (or guilds) increasingly are being used to predict vegetation response to global changes. Continued human population growth coupled with projected warmer and drier climate will alter the hydrologic regimes of many arid-zone rivers, including intermittent rivers. We aimed to identify (i) woody plant guilds associated with distinct stream types of an arid region and (ii) plant traits indicating adaptation to the selective pressures of water availability and fluvial disturbance. We used hierarchical clustering to identify 11 plant guilds from floodplains, terraces and uplands of eight Arizona rivers that vary in surface flow permanence, depth to ground water and intensity of fluvial disturbance. Six guilds were riparian pioneers with small, wind-dispersed seeds, three guilds were late-seral, shade-tolerant riparian taxa with large animal-dispersed seeds, and two guilds were composed of desert xerophytes. Within the riparian pioneer and seral groups, guilds varied in water acquisition and productivity traits including wood density and rooting depth. The community-weighted traits varied or covaried with water availability and fluvial disturbance. Root: shoot ratio, canopy height and leaf area were influenced strongly by water availability, with the latter two showing a nonlinear response to changes in water table depth. Leaf length increased, and wood density decreased, as sites become wetter and more fluvially disturbed. Community-weighted seed mass, seed dispersal and spinesence varied most strongly with elevation above thalweg (an indicator of decreasing fluvial disturbance). These analyses will enable prediction of changes in the relative abundance of plant types and plant traits in response to changes in stream flow regimes, such as shifts towards greater intermittency. The distribution patterns of guilds among riparian habitat types emphasise the importance of focusing conservation efforts not only on the limited number of perennial rivers remaining in arid regions, but also on intermittent and ephemeral rivers with shallow water tables.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000379953800007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiparian%2Bplant%2Bguilds%2Bof%2Bephemeral%252C%2Bintermittent%2Band%2Bperennial%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DJuliet%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DJC%26rft.aulast%3DStromberg%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffwb.12686%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1275%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1259-1275%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1259%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D61%26rft.au%3DStromberg%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DMerritt%252C%2BDM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0F39hf4R1lg8wvMEwe1LDFa&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/fwb.12686,"desert stream,plant functional type,riparian vegetation,trait,wood density","SAN-PEDRO RIVER,FUNCTIONAL TYPES,SPECIES TRAITS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,STREAM-FLOW,VEGETATION,GROUNDWATER,DIVERSITY,COMMUNITY",,"Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA"

The community is at the nexus of large-scale Arctic social and climate change resulting from economic shifts, permafrost melt events, and high temperatures. In this study, we approach Indigenous knowledge of climate impacts to water by investigating the role of the river Alazeya, which has enabled human life to thrive, given rise to the Indigenous governance of landscapes in the past, and today serves most of the Indigenous peoples in the region for their culture, food security, and well-being. To do this, we offer an ambitious system-change analysis of the socio-ecological context of the river basin and community by exploring oral histories recorded in the community between 2005 and 2020, combining them with relevant scientific literature and weather data from Russian measurement stations to detect and point to key messages of impacts. Our results confirm that the speed and extent of climate warming have increased since 1985.
