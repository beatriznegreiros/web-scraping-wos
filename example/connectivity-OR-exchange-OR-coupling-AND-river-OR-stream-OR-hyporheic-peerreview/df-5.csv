0,"Brunke, M",Sep 1999 ,Hyporheic invertebrates-the clinal nature of interstitial communities structured by hydrological exchange and environmental gradients,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"We investigated the environmental factors that control the local composition and distribution of hyporheic invertebrates within the sediments of a 3rd-order prealpine gravel-bed. stream (Toss River, Switzerland). We focused on faunal gradients as functions of environmental conditions reflecting 1) hydrological exchange patterns, 2) sediment depths, 3) physicochemical and fine particle gradients, and 4) interactions between these 3 factors;Three clustered sets of steel piezometers were installed at 4 depths in the sediment (20, 50, 100 150 cm) at locations with distinctly different types of hydrological exchange (infiltration, exfiltration, horizontal advection) to obtain samples of the fauna and the physicochemical and sedimentological conditions.Sixty taxa were identified, the most abundant of which were cyclopoid copepods (33%), ostracods (23%), and chironomids (11%). Total animal density patterns were strongly related to the ratio of particulate organic carbon to total fine particles (POC/TFP) which explained 63% of the variation in abundance within the sediment. Gradients in hyporheic community structure corresponded most to changes in POC/TFP, hydrological variables, and distance between the surface and groundwater habitats. Interstitial POC/TFP was determined mainly by the interaction between sediment depth and type of hydrological exchange in conjunction with season. The POC/TFP optima for individual taxa indicated that the depth to which epigean taxa penetrate sediments may be restricted by availability of the food resource, which decreases with decreasing POC/TFP, Therefore, the proportion of fine inorganic particles appears to be a critical determinant of the availability of food resources for interstitial invertebrates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000083837900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Binvertebrates-the%2Bclinal%2Bnature%2Bof%2Binterstitial%2Bcommunities%2Bstructured%2Bby%2Bhydrological%2Bexchange%2Band%2Benvironmental%2Bgradients%26rft.aufirst%3DM%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DBrunke%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468448%26rft.epage%3D362%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D344-362%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D344%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DBrunke%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DGonser%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Haddou, K",Jul 2018 ,"A large-scale study of hyporheic nitrate dynamics in a semi-arid catchment, the Tafna River, in Northwest Algeria",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Very few studies have evaluated the role of the hyporheic zone (HZ) in aquatic ecosystem functioning or the factors driving hyporheic exchange flows on a large scale, especially in a semi-arid environment such as the Tafna watershed in Algeria. To understand this role through time and space, hydrogeochemical parameters, particularly nitrate concentrations (NO3-N), were measured monthly between February 2013 and April 2014 in surface water (SW), interstitial water (IW) and groundwater (GW) along a 170-km stretch from the river's source to the outlet into the main stream of the Tafna River and its Isser and Chouly tributaries. The significant longitudinal evolution of NO3-N in the HZ was related to stream order and distance from the source. Moreover, the study indicated a significant difference between nitrate concentrations in the riffles (R) and pools (P) of the Tafna wadi. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the considerable impact of agriculture on nitrate concentrations. This study indicated on a large scale that nitrate-rich HZ contributed to increasing surface nitrate concentrations in upwelling sites and could be an important nitrate source for downstream SW, particularly during low-water (LW) periods when the Tafna can run dry on the surface. Thus, these results underline the importance of hyporheic zones functioning to the water quality of the watershed (process of enrichment and retention of nitrogen).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000437868400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B520%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Blarge-scale%2Bstudy%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bnitrate%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsemi-arid%2Bcatchment%252C%2Bthe%2BTafna%2BRiver%252C%2Bin%2BNorthwest%2BAlgeria%26rft.aufirst%3DKarima%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DHaddou%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-018-7673-2%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D77%26rft.au%3DHaddou%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DBendaoud%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DTaleb%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
2,"Kurz, MJ",Mar 2015 ,Diffusion and seepage-driven element fluxes from the hyporheic zone of a karst river,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) can be an important source of solutes to streams. Hyporheic solute fluxes are commonly dominated by advective exchange. However, fluxes from the HZ also may include diffusion and upward advection of ground water from underlying aquifers. We compared the relative importance of these transport mechanisms on solute budgets of a large, spring-fed river in north-central Florida using measurements of spring, river, and porewater chemistry, hydraulic gradients, and sediment hydraulic conductivity, and dilution of an injected dye (Rhodamine WT). Downstream increases in Fe, soluble reactive P (SRP), Ca2+, and Cl- concentrations of the river water suggest solute sources in addition to the major source springs. Shallow porewater concentrations of Fe, Mn, Ca2+, SRP, and Cl- were elevated relative to the river. Calculations of Fickian diffusion based on concentration gradients of these solutes indicate diffusion could account for the downstream increase in Fe concentration but only 5% of the downstream increase in SRP and <0.1% of the increases in Ca2+ and Cl-. Downstream decreases in Mn concentrations reflect in-stream retention despite predicted diffusion. Dye-trace results indicate that approximate to 13% of the river discharge originates from sources other than the major springs. Measured head gradients and low sediment hydraulic conductivity suggest vertical groundwater flow through the HZ is small. We used the SRP budget to partition the additional groundwater inputs between seepage through the HZ (approximate to 3% of river discharge) and flow paths that bypass the HZ (approximate to 10% of total river discharge). Flow paths that bypass the HZ dominated additional water delivery to the river, but diffusion, resulting from steep chemical gradients and low-permeability sediments, is an important mechanism for transporting solutes from the HZ to the river.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000349995000016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDiffusion%2Band%2Bseepage-driven%2Belement%2Bfluxes%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bkarst%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DMarie%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DKurz%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F679654%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D221%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D206-221%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D206%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DKurz%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DMartin%252C%2BJB%26rft.au%3DHensley%252C%2BRT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
3,"Knapp, JLA",Feb 2017 ,Tracer-based characterization of hyporheic exchange and benthic biolayers in streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Shallow benthic biolayers at the top of the streambed are believed to be places of enhanced biogeochemical turnover within the hyporheic zone. They can be investigated by reactive stream tracer tests with tracer recordings in the streambed and in the stream channel. Common in-stream measurements of such reactive tracers cannot localize where the processing primarily takes place, whereas isolated vertical depth profiles of solutes within the hyporheic zone are usually not representative of the entire stream. We present results of a tracer test where we injected the conservative tracer bromide together with the reactive tracer resazurin into a third-order stream and combined the recording of in-stream breakthrough curves with multidepth sampling of the hyporheic zone at several locations. The transformation of resazurin was used as an indicator of metabolism, and high-reactivity zones were identified from depth profiles. The results from our subsurface analysis indicate that the potential for tracer transformation (i.e., the reaction rate constant) varied with depth in the hyporheic zone. This highlights the importance of the benthic biolayer, which we found to be on average 2 cm thick in this study, ranging from one third to one half of the full depth of the hyporheic zone. The reach-scale approach integrated the effects of processes along the reach length, isolating hyporheic processes relevant for whole-stream chemistry and estimating effective reaction rates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000398568800032,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTracer-based%2Bcharacterization%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bbenthic%2Bbiolayers%2Bin%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJulia%2BL.%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DJLA%26rft.aulast%3DKnapp%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019393%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1594%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1575-1594%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1575%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DKnapp%252C%2BJLA%26rft.au%3DGonzalez-Pinzon%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Sun, RK",Oct 2022 ,The Influence Research on Nitrogen Transport and Reaction in the Hyporheic Zone with an In-Stream Structure,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is important for river ecological restoration as the main zone with nitrogen biochemical processes. The engineering of river ecological restoration can significantly change the hydrodynamics, as well as solute transport and reaction processes, but it is still not fully understood. In this study, nitrogen transport and reaction processes were analyzed in the HZ with an in-stream weir structure. An HZ model was built, and three reactions were considered with different design parameters of the weir structure and different permeability characteristics of porous media. The results show that a structure with a greater height on the overlying surface water enables the species to break through deeper porous media. It promotes the mean spatial reaction rates of nitrification and denitrification and results in increased net denitrification in most cases. In addition, increasing the burial depth of the structure leads to the same variation trends in the mean spatial reaction rates as increasing the structure height. Larger permeability coefficients in porous media can enhance flow exchange and increase mean spatial reaction rates. The results can help deepen the understanding of nitrogen transport and transformation in the HZ and optimize the design parameters and location of the in-stream structure.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000866923700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B12695%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BInfluence%2BResearch%2Bon%2BNitrogen%2BTransport%2Band%2BReaction%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bwith%2Ban%2BIn-Stream%2BStructure%26rft.aufirst%3DRuikang%26rft.auinit%3DRK%26rft.aulast%3DSun%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph191912695%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DSun%252C%2BRK%26rft.au%3DDong%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DFeng%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The conditions prevailing in the hyporheic zone of these ecosystems are of great importance in the process of component exchange between water and sediments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the type of sediments located at the bottom of the riverbed being part of a river-lake system on microbial activity in the hyporheic zone. An ex situ experiment was used to study the microbiological activity and the transformation of components in the collected river sediments. It was found that the specific properties of sediments varied depending on their location in the riverbed between the lakes comprising the system and that the prevailing meteorological conditions can also have an effect on microbial activity in the hyporheic zone, e.g., aerobic conditions. These conditions determined the intensity of component conversion in the sediments due to microbial metabolism. A closer understanding of the processes occurring in the hyporheic zone may allow the processes of water self-purification within river-lake systems to be supported in the future, which will contribute to the improvement of surface water quality.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000737362200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B3499%26rft.atitle%3DRole%2Bof%2BRiver-Lake%2BSystem%2BSediments%2Band%2BMicrobial%2BActivity%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DAngela%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DKuriata-Potasznik%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw13243499%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D24%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DKuriata-Potasznik%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSzymczyk%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DKobus%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Nevertheless, the factors that influence biotic communities along spatial and temporal gradients remain poorly understood. This study aimed to characterise the diversity and spatial pattern distribution of Cyclopoida and Ostracoda from the hyporheic zone in relation to the riverbed sediment structure and the quantity of organic matter in two second-order rivers in central Spain, whose alluvium is derived from materials of contrasting geology (siliceous vs. carbonates). Both streams were found to be characterised by marked habitat heterogeneity along the hyporheic flow path, as reflected by the different lithology, riverbed permeability and distinct hyporheic biota assemblages. The results indicate that the alluvium riverbeds dominated by carbonates rocks and associated with high permeable riverbeds had slightly diverse hyporheic assemblages (25 species in all) with species of mixed ecology (stygobites/stygophiles/stygoxenes). Conversely, the siliceous alluvium riverbeds with low mineralised waters, associated with reduced permeability and relatively less active surface/ground water exchanges, displayed slightly lower diversity (23 species) with assemblages exclusively composed of stygophiles/stygoxenes.

7,"Ren, J",Jun 1 2020 ,Model-Based Analysis of the Effects of Rippled Bed Morphologies on Hyporheic Exchange,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"Groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) exchange processes are important due to their critical role in controlling the transport of pollutants and ecologically related materials in rivers. In this paper, the surface water-groundwater coupling models of five wavy riverbed topographies were developed, and surface water velocity and pressure distribution under different wavy bed surface morphologies were studied. The upflows and downflows of sediment-water interface (SWI) were determined and quantified; in addition, the depth of hyporheic exchange and the locations of slow flow points were obtained. The obtained results showed that rippled bed morphologies disturbed the surface water flow field and separated adherent water flow at the water-sediment interface. The slope angle of water-slope of rippled beds was negatively correlated with the pressure of the water-sediment interface and positively correlated with flow velocity at the peak of the rippled bed. Upwelling and downwelling distributions basically depended on the geometry of the riverbed and did not change by changing the surface water velocity. The crest was a stable demarcation point between upflows and downflows, and the hyporheic exchange flux was negatively correlated with the angle of sloping slope. A stagnation zone existed in the hyporheic zone where both lateral and vertical flow velocity components approached zero, and its depth was similar to the depth of hyporheic zone. A lateral stagnation zone was located near the boundary of the reverse exchange zone in the hyporheic zone, and vertical stagnation zones were located on both sides of the maximum pressure of the water-sediment interface.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000527795100004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B04020023%26rft.atitle%3DModel-Based%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2Bthe%2BEffects%2Bof%2BRippled%2BBed%2BMorphologies%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HE.1943-5584.0001931%26rft.eissn%3D1943-5584%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1084-0699%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
8,"Wang, WZ",Mar 2018 ,The influence of hyporheic upwelling fluxes on inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the pore water of the Weihe River,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Hyporheic zone is an important region of nitrogen removal in river systems. Hyporheic exchange generally leads to heterogeneous redox environments, which are conducive to nitrogen transformation. This study seeks to determine the influence of hyporheic upwelling fluxes on inorganic nitrogen (NH4+, NO3-, and NO2-) concentrations in the sediment pore water of the Weihe River, China. The patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange on 12 August 2016 were derived by a one-dimensional heat transport model, and inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the pore water, surface water, and groundwater were obtained. The results indicated that hyporheic water exchange was characterized by upwelling at each point during the test period. Moreover, NH4+ dominated the hyporheic zone from 0 to 45 cm, likely due to organic nitrogen mineralization. Additionally, a non-linear relationship was observed between NH4+ concentrations and upwelling fluxes. This relationship was derived by analyzing the effect of upwelling on biogeochemical activity and nitrogen transformation. Notably, increasing upwelling fluxes less than 400 mm/d resulted in high NH4+ concentrations, whereas fluxes exceeding 400 mm/d led to low NH4+ concentrations. Overall, the variations in inorganic nitrogen associated with hyporheic water exchange are of great importance for controlling nitrogen pollution and maintaining sustainable health in river systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000424938300014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bupwelling%2Bfluxes%2Bon%2Binorganic%2Bnitrogen%2Bconcentrations%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bpore%2Bwater%2Bof%2Bthe%2BWeihe%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DWeize%26rft.auinit%3DWZ%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecoleng.2017.12.012%26rft.eissn%3D1872-6992%26rft.epage%3D115%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0925-8574%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D105-115%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D105%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D112%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BWZ%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Yet no routine water chemistry samples are taken from riverbed substrate, despite many interstitial species being dependant on specific physicochemical conditions. This paper examines water and nutrient exchanges between stream and substrate, the hyporheic zone, and the consequent alteration to the chemistry of interstitial and in-stream waters, which in turn leads to small-scale but significant changes in habitat. Bed topography, principally a pool-riffle sequence, was surveyed and hydraulically sampled to examine the hyporheic flow pathways generated between the stream, substrate, and groundwater-creating an ecotone. Hyporheic zone, in-stream and groundwater hydrochemistry, and hydraulic measures were assessed at a braided woodland river reach using a dense monitoring approach. The findings demonstrate that through a 23-m pool-riffle sequence, where water infiltrates at the riffle-head and subsequently exfiltrates at the riffle-tail, there is a 5% reduction in mean in-stream nitrate-N and a 73% reduction in hyporheic zone concentration. When calcium-enriched riffle-tail exfiltrate meets riffle-runoff water that is turbulently oxygenated from riffle-flow, an interstitial redoxcline is created. Dissolved oxygen nocturnally drops, with photosynthetic rate reduction, which causes hyporheic nitrate-N to double its daytime concentration. The results are related to the Yorkshire River Esk freshwater pearl mussels, Margaritifera margaritifera Linnaeus (1758), a declining endangered species.

10,"Karwan, DL",Jan 19 2012 ,Hyporheic exchange and streambed filtration of suspended particles,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Fine particles are necessary for watershed biogeochemical cycling and stream metabolic processes but pose a risk to water quality if present in excess or if carrying sorbed contaminants. Despite having low settling velocities, these particles can leave suspension during downstream transport by a series of processes such as hyporheic filtration, flocculation, and biofilm entrapment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the retention of clay particles within a stream reach due to streambed filtration. To this end, we quantify hyporheic exchange through coupled formulations of turbulent surface water flow in the overlying stream and saturated groundwater flow in the streambed. Particle filtration models are informed by flow-through column experiments conducted with repacked streambed material. Results of our model simulations of hyporheic exchange demonstrate that streambed particle filtration depends on overlying streamflow and, to a lesser extent, on hyporheic zone substrate. Retention of suspended particles within the streambed sediments more than doubles between high and drought flows and varies by less than 45% across substrate grain size classes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000299385500007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW01519%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bstreambed%2Bfiltration%2Bof%2Bsuspended%2Bparticles%26rft.aufirst%3DDiana%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DDL%26rft.aulast%3DKarwan%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011173%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DKarwan%252C%2BDL%26rft.au%3DSaiers%252C%2BJE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Field measurements and numerical simulations show the formation of a low-permeability layer (LPL) near the bed surface due to fine particle clogging, and consequently reduction of exchange fluxes between the bed and river water. A characteristic porosity (epsilon*) and time scale were derived to quantify the clogging process and effects on transport. Both the exchange flux and mean solute residence time were found to follow a power law relationship with epsilon*. For the normalized particle exchange flux, the exponent is close to unity, i.e., a linear relationship with epsilon*. The results also showed significant effects of the fine particle concentration, pressure difference, sediment collision efficiency and fine particle diameter on the bed clogging. Large values of these parameters led to intensified clogging, with the formation of different types of LPL.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000468138400012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInterplay%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bfine%2Bparticle%2Bdeposition%2Bin%2Ba%2Briverbed%26rft.aufirst%3DGuangqiu%26rft.auinit%3DGQ%26rft.aulast%3DJin%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2019.04.014%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.epage%3D157%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D145-157%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D145%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D128%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BYL%26rft.au%3DBarry%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
12,"Mouw, JEB",Oct 2009 ,INFLUENCES OF FLOODING AND HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE ON FLOODPLAIN PLANT RICHNESS AND PRODUCTIVITY,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Flooding disturbance and associated fluvial processes are generally thought to be the primary controls on floodplain species richness patterns. We expanded this idea to include ground and surface water (hyporheic) exchange within alluvial flood plains. At the floodplain scale, we hypothesized that upwelling areas would be richer in species and support higher growth rates of woody plants. At reaches within each flood plain, we evaluated the mechanisms of flood duration, patterns in sedimentation and driftwood as influences. We found patterns of species richness within the shifting mosaic of floodplain wetland habitats to be incoherent with flood duration for large flood plains on the Flathead and Talkeetna Rivers. Rather, species richness was closely associated with hyporheic exchange at the floodplain scale and locally with alluvial particle size. Species richness was highest in areas of both flood plains characterized by upwelling groundwater. On annually scoured surfaces, richness was affected by large wood debris that reduced flow competence, allowing fine sediment deposition and plant establishment. Richness within upwelling and downwelling reaches was highest at sites with the finest alluvia.Growth rates of woody species used as indices of site productivity were also significantly higher at areas characterized by upwelling. We concluded that plant species richness was strongly controlled by hyporheic exchange at the floodplain scale and locally by the deposition of fine alluvia. This interpretation was not consistent with intermediate levels of flood disturbance. Indeed, areas of the flood plain least influenced by flow energy had the highest richness on both flood plains.

Hyporheic processes have been well-documented in surface water-groundwater mixing zones underlying and directly adjacent to streams. Alluvial aquifers underlying meander necks provide a further extension of the hyporheic zone. Hydraulic head and temperature data, collected from a set of wells across a meander neck, show stream water moves through the meander neck. The hydraulic gradient across the meander neck (0.006) is greater than the stream gradient (0.003) between the same points, driving the bypass. Rapid subsurface response to elevated stream stage shows a hydraulic connection between the stream and the alluvial aquifer. Temperature data and a Peclet number (Pe) of 43.1 indicate that thermal transport is dominated by advection from the upstream side to the downstream side of the meander neck. The temperature observed within the alluvial aquifer correlates with seasonal temperature variation. Together, the pressure and temperature data indicate that water moves across the meander neck. The inflow of stream water through the meander neck suggests that the meander system may host biogeochemical hyporheic zone processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000242324700005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStream%2Bwater%2Bbypass%2Bthrough%2Ba%2Bmeander%2Bneck%252C%2Blaterally%2Bextending%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DEric%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DEW%26rft.aulast%3DPeterson%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-006-0050-3%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D1451%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1443-1451%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1443%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DPeterson%252C%2BEW%26rft.au%3DSickbert%252C%2BTB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Empirically parameterized and calibrated groundwater flow models were used to assess the influence of sub-channel thaw on hyporheic exchange. Average thaw depths were at least two-fold greater under the higher-energy, alluvial stream than under the low-energy, peat-lined stream. Alluvial hyporheic exchange had shorter residence times and longer flowpaths that occurred across greater portions of the thawed sediments. For both reaches, the morphologic (longitudinal bed topography) and hydraulic conditions (surface and groundwater flow properties) set the potential for hyporheic flow. Simulations of deeper thaw, as predicted under a warming arctic climate, only influence hyporheic exchange until a threshold depth. This depth is primarily determined by the hydraulic head gradients imposed by the stream morphology. Therefore, arctic hyporheic exchange extent is likely to be independent of greater sub-stream thaw depths.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000252566900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BL02501%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bmorphology%2Band%2Bpermafrost%2Bdynamics%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Barctic%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%2Bunder%2Bwarming%2Bclimate%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DJay%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DZarnetske%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2007GL032049%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DMcNamara%252C%2BJP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
15,"Ward, AS",Apr 13 2012 ,Hydrologic and geomorphic controls on hyporheic exchange during base flow recession in a headwater mountain stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic hydrodynamics are a control on stream ecosystems, yet we lack a thorough understanding of catchment controls on these flow paths, including valley constraint and hydraulic gradients in the valley bottom. We performed four whole-stream solute tracer injections under steady state flow conditions at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, United States) and collected electrical resistivity (ER) imaging to directly quantify the 2-D spatial extent of hyporheic exchange through seasonal base flow recession. ER images provide spatially distributed information that is unavailable for stream solute transport modeling studies from monitoring wells alone. The lateral and vertical extent of the hyporheic zone was quantified using both ER images and spatial moment analysis. Results oppose the common conceptual model of hyporheic ""compression'' by increased lateral hydraulic gradients toward the stream. We found that the extent of the hyporheic zone increased with decreasing vertical gradients away from the stream, in contrast to expectations from conceptual models. Increasing hyporheic extent was observed with both increasing and decreasing down-valley (i.e., parallel to the valley gradient) and cross-valley (i.e., from the hillslope to the stream, perpendicular to the valley gradient) hydraulic gradients. We conclude that neither cross-valley nor down-valley hydraulic gradients are sufficient predictors of hyporheic exchange flux nor flow path network extent. Increased knowledge of the controls on hyporheic exchange, the temporal dynamics of exchange flow paths, and their the spatial distribution is the first step toward predicting hyporheic exchange at the scale of individual flow paths. Future studies need to more carefully consider interactions between spatiotemporally dynamic hydraulic gradients and subsurface architecture as controls on hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000302874400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW04513%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Band%2Bgeomorphic%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bduring%2Bbase%2Bflow%2Brecession%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bmountain%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011461%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DFitzgerald%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DSingha%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
16,"Klos, PZ",Oct 2015 ,"Influence of hyporheic exchange, substrate distribution, and other physically linked hydrogeomorphic characteristics on abundance of freshwater mussels",ECOHYDROLOGY,"Both endangered and non-endangered unionid mussels are heterogeneously distributed within the Allegheny River, Pennsylvania. Mussel populations vary from high to low density downstream of Kinzua Dam, and the direction, amount, and range of hyporheic exchange (seepage) at the sediment-water interface were suspected to influence their distribution and abundance. Nineteen hydrogeomorphic variables, including the quantification of seepage metrics, substrate size, river stage, river discharge, and shear stress, were measured at five reaches on the Allegheny River within 80km downstream of Kinzua Dam. Analysis revealed significant (=005) non-linear correlations between mussel population density and directional mean seepage (positive relationship), river width (positive relationship), and median substrate size (negative relationship). Specifically, seepage findings showed that increases in upward seepage and decreases in the overall range of seepage related to increases in mussel population density. River width, directional mean seepage, and median substrate size were also found to co-vary with marginal significance (=01), making their individual influences on mussel population density uncertain. Absolute mean seepage, water depth, hydraulic head, temperature differences between the surface water and substrate, and other substrate metrics besides median grain size were not found to significantly correlate to mussel population density. Considering the physical processes often linking seepage to other explanatory variables, future research in seepage-mussel relationships should work to isolate the mechanistic influence of hyporheic exchange independently from its common covariation with substrate size and geomorphology.

17,"Wu, LW",Mar 2020 ,Impact of Flow Alteration and Temperature Variability on Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Coupled groundwater flow and heat transport within hyporheic zones extensively affect water, energy, and solute exchange with surrounding sediments. The local and cumulative implications of this tightly coupled process strongly depend on characteristics of drivers (i.e., discharge and temperature of the water column) and modulators (i.e., hydraulic and thermal properties of the sediment). With this in mind, we perform a systematic numerical analysis of hyporheic responses to understand how the temporal variability of river discharge and temperature affect flow and heat transport within hyporheic zones. We identify typical time series of river discharge and temperature from gauging stations along the headwater region of Mississippi River Basin, which are characterized by different degrees of flow alteration, to drive a physics-based model of the hyporheic exchange process. Our modeling results indicate that coupled groundwater flow and heat transport significantly affects the dynamic response of hyporheic zones, resulting in substantial differences in exchange rates and characteristic time scales of hyporheic exchange processes. We also find that the hyporheic zone dampens river temperature fluctuations increasingly with higher frequency of temperature fluctuations. This dampening effect depends on the system transport time scale and characteristics of river discharge and temperature variability. Furthermore, our results reveal that the flow alteration reduces the potential of hyporheic zones to act as a temperature buffer and hinders denitrification within hyporheic zones. These results have significant implications for understanding the drivers of local variability in hyporheic exchange and the implications for the development of thermal refugia and ecosystem functioning in hyporheic zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000538000800021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR026225%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2BFlow%2BAlteration%2Band%2BTemperature%2BVariability%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%26rft.aufirst%3DLiwen%26rft.auinit%3DLW%26rft.aulast%3DWu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR026225%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BLW%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
18,"Zheng, LZ",Sep 2018 ,Diel Stream Temperature Effects on Nitrogen Cycling in Hyporheic Zones,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Stream temperature often varies diurnally and seasonally, and these variations propagate into hyporheic zones (HZs), forming dynamic and heterogeneous thermal patterns. The complex thermal distribution creates potential biogeochemical hotspots and hot moments. Yet, how diel temperature variations affect HZ nitrogen cycling is unknown. We thus conducted a series of multiphysics numerical simulations of nonisothermal fluid flow and multicomponent reactive solute transport to investigate this problem. We imposed a sinusoidally varying stream temperature representing diel warming and cooling and studied the effects of different temperature means and amplitudes on HZ nitrate removal efficiency inside a streambed with a dune. The results showed that the time-variable nitrification, denitrification, and nitrate removal efficiency responded differently to the diel stream temperature signal. The temporal variation of spatially averaged nitrification rate tracks the stream temperature signal, whereas the spatially averaged denitrification variation pattern has a more complex connection to temperature. We observed a persistent hotspot where significant denitrification rates are present over the 24-hr period. We further evaluated and estimated the bulk nitrate removal efficiency calculated by time integration of spatially averaged reaction rates over a day. For denitrification-dominant systems, the bulk nitrate removal efficiency for cases with dynamic stream temperature was effectively the same as those with an equivalent constant mean temperature. Therefore, the bulk removal efficiency of a thermally dynamic diel system may be represented by an equivalent isothermal system given stable flow conditions. However, since large instantaneous variations in various rates were observed, the results imply that randomly timed field measurements are unlikely to be representative. This has to be considered for both past and future synoptic observational studies.Stream temperature naturally varies over daily and seasonal periods. This could cause temperature-dependent chemical and biological processes to vary simultaneously. Within the permeable streambed are areas called hyporheic zones where stream water circulates through in and out of the bed. The heat carried by this hyporheic flow that originates from the stream forms dynamic and complex temperature distributions in the hyporheic zone. The thermal patterns within the streambed could determine the presence of denitrification hotspots and hot moments since the hyporheic zone is an important site for many chemical reactions including nitrogen cycling. Through modeling the flow and reaction transport processes within the hyporheic zone, we found that denitrification hotspots persisted despite dynamic and complex hyporheic zone thermal patterns. Our simulation results can help explain previous observations of warmer stream temperature corresponding to lower in-stream nitrate concentrations. The results also imply that instantaneous snapshots through synoptic chemical sampling or reaction rate quantification may not be representative since the results and interpretations from such sampling strategies will depend on the time the samples were taken. Despite exploring a large range of modeled instantaneous variations of stream temperature, the results show that the steady, mean temperature can be used to estimate the bulk nitrate removal efficiency of the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000447644800007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDiel%2BStream%2BTemperature%2BEffects%2Bon%2BNitrogen%2BCycling%2Bin%2BHyporheic%2BZones%26rft.aufirst%3DLizhi%26rft.auinit%3DLZ%26rft.aulast%3DZheng%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018JG004412%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D2760%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2743-2760%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2743%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D123%26rft.au%3DZheng%252C%2BLZ%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Nogaro, G",Jun 2010 ,Influence of streambed sediment clogging on microbial processes in the hyporheic zone,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"P>1. The hyporheic zone plays a key role in hydrological exchange and biogeochemical processes in streambed sediments. The clogging of sediments caused by the deposition of particles in the bed of streams and rivers can decrease sediment permeability and hence greatly affect hyporheic microbial processes.2. The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of sediment clogging on hyporheic microbial processes in three French rivers (the Usses, Drome and Isere). In each river, microbial abundance and activity were studied at three depths (10, 30 and 50 cm) in the sediment at one unclogged (high porosity) and one clogged site (low porosity).3. The results showed that the sediment clogging had inconsistent effects on microbial processes in the three rivers. Increases (Usses) or decreases (Drome and Isere) in both aerobic and anaerobic processes were detected at the clogged sites compared to unclogged sites. These results suggest that microbial changes because of the sediment clogging are mainly mediated by the residence time of water within the hyporheic sediments.4. A single model predicting the effect of clogging on hyporheic microbial processes cannot be applied generally to all rivers because the degree of clogging creates heterogeneous effects on flow rates between surface and interstitial waters. As a consequence, the influence of heterogeneous clogging on surface water-hyporheic exchanges needs to be evaluated by water tracing and hydraulic modelling to determine the links between microbial processes and hydraulic heterogeneity induced by clogging in hyporheic sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000277525400011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bstreambed%2Bsediment%2Bclogging%2Bon%2Bmicrobial%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DGeraldine%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DNogaro%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2009.02352.x%26rft.epage%3D1302%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1288-1302%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1288%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DNogaro%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DMontuelle%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Knust, AE",Apr 15 2009 ,"Using a fluctuating tracer to estimate hyporheic exchange in restored and unrestored reaches of the Truckee River, Nevada, USA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The goal of this research was to compare hyporheic activity in recently restored and adjacent un-restored reaches of the Truckee River downstream from the Reno/Sparks metropolitan area. The installation of rocky riffles and raised channel bed elevations in the restored reaches may have increased the degree of surface-subsurface interaction. A fluctuating chloride concentration signal served as the tracer, induced by the variable influx of higher salinity water several miles upstream from the Study reach. The solute transport model, OTIS, was used ill Conjunction with the hydrodynamic model. DYNHYD5, to estimate transient storage parameters under unsteady flow conditions. The model was calibrated to chloride concentrations measured over a period of three days at six in-stream locations representing restored and un-restored reaches. An automated parameter estimation algorithm (SCE-UA) Was used to optimize parameters for multiple reaches simultaneously and generate a distribution of parameter estimates. Results Suggest that the transient storage zone cross-sectional area (A(s)) is larger in the restored reaches than in the unrestored reaches, but the exchange coefficient (alpha) is smaller, leading to increased hyporheic residence time and hydrologic retention in the vicinity of channel reconstructions. Scenarios were used to simulate the potential effects of increased subsurface residence time oil denitrification and in-stream NO3-N concentrations. Monte Carlo analysis was performed to assess uncertainty in the simulation results and show the potential for greater nutrient retention ill the lower Truckee River as a result of channel restoration.

21,"Chen, XB",Apr 2015 ,Three-dimensional versus two-dimensional bed form-induced hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone is often a critical component of river systems. Hyporheic exchange is generally forced by variation in riverbed topography such as due to bed forms. Most previous research on bed form-driven hyporheic flow has focused on two-dimensional (2-D) dunes and ripples, while little has been done on their three-dimensional (3-D) counterparts. Here we compared hyporheic exchange and associated metrics for a previously studied pair of corresponding 2-D and 3-D bed forms. To accomplish this, a series of multiphysics computational fluid dynamics models were conducted both in 2-D and 3-D with similar open channel Reynolds numbers (Re). Results show that the pressure gradient along the sediment-water interface is highly sensitive to the spatial structure of bed forms, which consequently determines hyporheic flow dynamics. Hyporheic flux is a function of Re for both 2-D and 3-D dunes via a power law; however, the equivalent 3-D dunes have a higher flux since the 3-D form induces more drag. The hyporheic zone depths and volumes are only slightly different with the 3-D case having a larger volume. The mean fluid residence times for both cases are related to Re by an inverse power law relationship, with the 3-D dune having smaller residence times at moderate to high Re. The effects of increasing flux on residence time in 3-D dunes are partly modulated by a slightly increasing hyporheic volume. Our results suggest that a 2-D idealization is a reasonable approximation for the more complex 3-D situation if local details are unimportant but that development of predictive models for mean fluxes and residence times, which are critical for biogeochemical processes, based on 2-D models may be insufficient.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000354733500059,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThree-dimensional%2Bversus%2Btwo-dimensional%2Bbed%2Bform-induced%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaobing%26rft.auinit%3DXB%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR016848%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2936%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2923-2936%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2923%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXB%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Peterson, EW",Oct 15 2008 ,High frequency stream bed mobility of a low-gradient agricultural stream with implications on the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Little Kickapoo Creek (LKC), a low-gradient stream, mobilizes its streambed-fundamentally altering its near-surface hypoheic zone-more frequently than do higher-gradient mountain and karst streams. LKC streamed mobility was assessed through streamed surveys, sediments sampling, and theoretical calculations comparing basal shear stress (tau(b)) with critical shear stress (tau(b)). Baseflow tau(b) is capable of entraining a d(50) particle; bankfull flow could entrain a 51.2 mm particle. No particle that large occurs in the top 30 cm of the substrate, suggesting that the top 30 cm of the substrate is mobilized and redistributed during bankfull events. Bankfull events occur every 7.6 months; flows capable of entraining d(50) and d(85) particles occur on average every 0.85 and 2.1 months, respectively. Streamed surveys verify streamed mobility at conditions below bankfull. While higher gradient streams have higher potential energy that LKC, they achieve streamed-mobilization thersholds less frequently. Heterogenous sediments redistribution creates an environment where substrate hydraulic conductivity (K) varies over four orders of magnitude. The frequency and magnitude of the substrate entrainment has implication on hyporheic zone function in fluid, solute and thermal transport models, interpretations of hyporheic zone stability, and understanding of LKC's aquatic ecosystem.

23,"Westhoff, MC",Oct 12 2011 ,Quantifying hyporheic exchange at high spatial resolution using natural temperature variations along a first-order stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange is an important process that underpins stream ecosystem function, and there have been numerous ways to characterize and quantify exchange flow rates and hyporheic zone size. The most common approach, using conservative stream tracer experiments and 1-D solute transport modeling, results in oversimplified representations of the system. Here we present a new approach to quantify hyporheic exchange and the size of the hyporheic zone (HZ) using high-resolution temperature measurements and a coupled 1-D transient storage and energy balance model to simulate in-stream water temperatures. Distributed temperature sensing was used to observe in-stream water temperatures with a spatial and temporal resolution of 2 and 3 min, respectively. The hyporheic exchange coefficient (which describes the rate of exchange) and the volume of the HZ were determined to range between 0 and 2.7 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 0 and 0.032 m(3) m(-1), respectively, at a spatial resolution of 1-10 m, by simulating a time series of in-stream water temperatures along a 565 m long stretch of a small first-order stream in central Luxembourg. As opposed to conventional stream tracer tests, two advantages of this approach are that exchange parameters can be determined for any stream segment over which data have been collected and that the depth of the HZ can be estimated as well. Although the presented method was tested on a small stream, it has potential for any stream where rapid (in regard to time) temperature change of a few degrees can be obtained.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000295980100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW10508%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bat%2Bhigh%2Bspatial%2Bresolution%2Busing%2Bnatural%2Btemperature%2Bvariations%2Balong%2Ba%2Bfirst-order%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DMC%26rft.aulast%3DWesthoff%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR009767%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DWesthoff%252C%2BMC%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DSavenije%252C%2BHHG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We parameterized the model using a Continuous map of surface water stage derived from LIDAR remote sensing data.

25,"Frei, S",Aug 2015 ,FINIFLUX: An implicit finite element model for quantification of groundwater fluxes and hyporheic exchange in streams and rivers using radon,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A quantitative understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions is vital for sustainable management of water quantity and quality. The noble gas radon-222 (Rn) is becoming increasingly used as a sensitive tracer to quantify groundwater discharge to wetlands, lakes, and rivers: a development driven by technical and methodological advances in Rn measurement. However, quantitative interpretation of these data is not trivial, and the methods used to date are based on the simplest solutions to the mass balance equation (e.g., first-order finite difference and inversion). Here we present a new implicit numerical model (FINIFLUX) based on finite elements for quantifying groundwater discharge to streams and rivers using Rn surveys at the reach scale (1-50 km). The model is coupled to a state-of-the-art parameter optimization code Parallel-PEST to iteratively solve the mass balance equation for groundwater discharge and hyporheic exchange. The major benefit of this model is that it is programed to be very simple to use, reduces non-uniqueness, and provides numerically stable estimates of groundwater fluxes and hyporheic residence times from field data. FINIFLUX was tested against an analytical solution and then implemented on two German rivers of differing magnitude, the Salzach (similar to 112 m(3) s(-1)) and the Rote Main (similar to 4 m(3) s(-1)). We show that using previous inversion techniques numerical instability can lead to physically impossible negative values, whereas the new model provides stable positive values for all scenarios. We hope that by making FINIFLUX freely available to the community that Rn might find wider application in quantifying groundwater discharge to streams and rivers and thus assist in a combined management of surface and groundwater systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000363402800048,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFINIFLUX%253A%2BAn%2Bimplicit%2Bfinite%2Belement%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bquantification%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%2Bfluxes%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%2Busing%2Bradon%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFrei%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017212%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6786%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6776-6786%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6776%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DFrei%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DGilfedder%252C%2BBS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
26,"Hester, ET",Jan 2009 ,The influence of in-stream structures on summer water temperatures via induced hyporheic exchange,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Temperature is an important controlling factor for ecological functions. In-stream geomorphic structures affect stream thermal regimes by facilitating hyporheic exchange of water and heat between stream channels and underlying sediments. We varied the height of an experimental weir (representing debris dams, log dams, and boulder weirs) in a small stream during the summer and monitored the hydraulic and thermal response of surface and subsurface water using a three-dimensional sensor array. The presence of the structure altered stream temperature patterns, increasing thermal heterogeneity in surface water and shallow sediments by up to similar to 1.0 degrees C. We estimated heat conduction and weir-induced hyporheic heat advection across the streambed, and evaluated their response to key parameters. Conduction and advection were of similar magnitude and oscillated over the stream's diel temperature cycle. Weir-induced hyporheic heat advection caused slight cooling of the surface stream (up to similar to 0.01 degrees C), and increased with weir height, but was considerably less important to the overall heat budget of the stream than was atmospheric heat exchange. Streambed hydraulic conductivity appears to be the overriding factor determining the magnitude of weir-induced hyporheic influence on surface water temperatures. We conclude that weir-type structures will induce ecologically significant surface and subsurface thermal heterogeneity in many stream settings, but that weir-induced hyporheic heat advection will have ecologically significant thermal effects on surface water only in coarse streambeds. Because these structures are common in natural streams and stream restoration projects, such thermal effects may be important on a landscape level.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000265168800028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bin-stream%2Bstructures%2Bon%2Bsummer%2Bwater%2Btemperatures%2Bvia%2Binduced%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DErich%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.2009.54.1.0355%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D367%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D355-367%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D355%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DDoyle%252C%2BMW%26rft.au%3DPoole%252C%2BGC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"Allgeier, J",Aug 2021 ,Systematic Evaluation of Geometry-Driven Lateral River-Groundwater Exchange in Floodplains,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The widening and narrowing of river-valley aquifers can cause valley-scale lateral hyporheic exchange even if the river is straight and its slope is uniform. For the aforementioned system, we derive a semi-analytical solution describing steady-state groundwater flow for a simplified two-dimensional geometry of the aquifer and uniform lateral influx from hillslopes. We use this solution to evaluate the geometry-driven lateral hyporheic exchange flux between the aquifer and the river. By systematically varying the model parameters, we decipher how this flux and the area of the exchange zone depend on geometric (e.g., minimum and maximum domain width) and hydrogeological parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, ambient hydraulic gradient and lateral influxes). The results suggest pronounced hyporheic flow for cases with distinct widening behavior and small cross-sectional widths at the floodplain inlet and outlet. Furthermore, we analyze the travel-time distribution of water flowing through the exchange zone, which approximately follows a beta distribution. We express our findings in terms of simple proxy-equations that can be used to easily estimate the exchange flux, the area of the exchange zone, and the associated travel-time distribution for a given geographic/landscape setting.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000688205400038,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030239%26rft.atitle%3DSystematic%2BEvaluation%2Bof%2BGeometry-Driven%2BLateral%2BRiver-Groundwater%2BExchange%2Bin%2BFloodplains%26rft.aufirst%3DJonas%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DAllgeier%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030239%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DAllgeier%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DMartin%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DCirpka%252C%2BOA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
28,"Jonsson, K",May 2004 ,Sorption behavior and long-term retention of reactive solutes in the hyporheic zone of streams,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING,"This paper analyzes the transport of sorbing solutes by extending the advective storage path model developed for longitudinal transport of inert solutes in streams coupled with flow-induced uptake in the hyporheic zone. Independent observations of a conservative (H-3) and a reactive (Cr-51) tracer in both the stream water and the hyporheic zone were used to differentiate between hydraulic and sorption processes. The method of temporal moments was found to be inadequate for parameter determination, whereas fitting versus the entire tracer breakthrough curves with special emphasis on the tail indicates that the proposed model could be used to represent both conservative and reactive transport. Information on the tracer inventory of the conservative tracer in the hyporheic zone was found to be of vital importance to the evaluation of the hydraulic exchange. A model evaluation based on stream water data alone can yield predictions of a wash-out in the hyporheic zone that deviates markedly from the observed wash-out. This prohibits long-term predictions of the wash-out from the hyporheic zone as well as the evaluation of sorption properties. The sorption in the hyporheic zone was found to follow a two-step model, where the first step is instantaneous and the second kinetic. A model with a single-step sorption process could not reproduce the observed breakthrough curves. An evaluation of the relative importance of including sorption kinetics in solute stream transport models is elucidated by means of the analytical expressions for the temporal moments. The omission of the kinetics in the second sorption step in the hyporheic zone will result in relative errors in the moments of second order or higher. The error will increase with decreasing residence time in the hyporheic zone. Especially, long-term predictions of the wash-out from the hyporheic zone require consideration of the rate-limited sorption.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000220979600011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSorption%2Bbehavior%2Band%2Blong-term%2Bretention%2Bof%2Breactive%2Bsolutes%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DK%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DJonsson%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9372%25282004%2529130%253A5%2528573%2529%26rft.eissn%3D1943-7870%26rft.epage%3D584%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9372%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D573-584%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D573%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D130%26rft.au%3DJonsson%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DJohansson%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DWorman%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
29,"Moren, I",Dec 2021 ,Cross-Validating Hydromechanical Models and Tracer Test Assessments of Hyporheic Exchange Flow in Streams With Different Hydromorphological Characteristics,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) can generally be quantified through two different approaches. The first approach, which is deductive, entails physically based models, supported with relevant observations. The second approach includes inductive assessments of stream tracer tests using solute transport models, which provide a useful mathematical framework that allows for upscaling of results, but included parameters often have a vague physical base, which limits the possibilities of generalizing results using independent hydromorphological observations. To better understand how the physical basis of HEF-quantifying parameters relates to stream hydromorphology at different spatial scales, we cross-validated the results from (a) tracer test assessments using a 1D solute transport model that accounts for HEF and (b) an independent hydromechanical model that represents HEF driven by multiscale pressure gradients along the streambed interface. To parameterize the models, topographical surveys, tracer tests, and streambed hydraulic conductivity measurements were performed in 10 stream reaches, differing in terms of geomorphology, slope, and discharge. The results show that the models were cross-validated in terms of the average exchange velocity, providing a plausible physical explanation for this parameter in small alluvial streams with low discharges, shallow depth, and moderate slopes. However, the hydromechanical model generally resulted in wider residence time distributions and occasionally higher average residence times compared to the tracer test assessments. From the cross-validated multiscale hydromechanical model, we learned that water surface profile variations were the main drivers of HEF in all investigated streams and that spatial scales between 20 cm and 5 m dominated the estimated HEF velocity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000735901700066,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030248%26rft.atitle%3DCross-Validating%2BHydromechanical%2BModels%2Band%2BTracer%2BTest%2BAssessments%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BFlow%2Bin%2BStreams%2BWith%2BDifferent%2BHydromorphological%2BCharacteristics%26rft.auinit%3DI%26rft.aulast%3DMoren%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030248%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DMoren%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DRiml%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DWorman%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Application of a simple Fickian diffusion model to laboratory data obtained with passive solutes and stationary bedforms proves successful within a range of durations of the contamination process. A dimensionless form of the diffusion coefficient, scaled with dynamic, physical, and geometric properties of the system is derived by comparison with another physically based model. A prediction of the dimensionless diffusion coefficient is obtained as a function of the timescale of the exchange process and is validated with a few sets of results from laboratory tests.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000231315100004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDiffusive%2Bbehavior%2Bof%2Bbedform-induced%2Bhyporheic-exchange%2Bin%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarion%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9372%25282005%2529131%253A9%25281260%2529%26rft.eissn%3D1943-7870%26rft.epage%3D1266%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9372%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1260-1266%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1260%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D131%26rft.au%3DMarion%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DZaramella%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
32,"Clinton, SM",Jun 2002 ,Forest-river interactions: Influence on hyporheic dissolved organic carbon concentrations in a floodplain terrace,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"In large floodplain rivers, hyporheic (subsurface) flowpaths transfer nutrients from productive riparian terraces to oligotrophic off-channel habitats. Because dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fuels microbial processes and hyporheic microorganisms represent the first stage of retention and transformation of these nutrients, understanding DOC flux can provide information on the constraints of microbial metabolism in the hyporheic zone of rivers, We monitored hydrology, physicochemical indicators, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics during low and high discharge periods in the hyporheic zone of a riparian terrace on the Queets River, Washington, to understand what processes control the supply of carbon to subsurface microbial communities. As discharge increased, terrace hyporheic, flowpaths changed from parallel to focused, and the location of surface water inputs to the terrace shifted from the terrace edge to head. Overall, DOC concentrations decreased along hyporheic flowpaths; however, concentrations at points along the flowpaths varied with position along the head gradient and age of the overlying vegetation. We estimated that there is insufficient DOC in advecting surface water to support hyporheic microbial metabolism in this riparian terrace, These trends indicate that there are additional carbon sources to the subsurface water, and we conclude that DOC is leaching from overlying riparian soils within the forest patches. Thus, subsurface DOC concentrations reflect a balance between surface water inputs, metabolic uptake, and allochthonous inputs from forest soils.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000176769300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DForest-river%2Binteractions%253A%2BInfluence%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bconcentrations%2Bin%2Ba%2Bfloodplain%2Bterrace%26rft.aufirst%3DSM%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DClinton%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1752-1688.2002.tb00984.x%26rft.epage%3D631%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D619-631%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D619%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DClinton%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DEdwards%252C%2BRT%26rft.au%3DNaiman%252C%2BRJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
33,"Grimaldi, C",Nov 2000 ,"Nitrate depletion during within-stream transport: Effects of exchange processes between streamwater, the hyporheic and riparian zones",WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"In regions with intensive agriculture and shallow hydrological systems, headstreams are often polluted with nitrate even at the springs. In North-West France, nitrate concentration was seen to decrease downstream during baseflow conditions when the stream flows on granite, but this does not occur on schist. In order to explain this difference in behaviour, we analysed the groundwaters and surveyed the redox conditions (using a field test for ferrous iron) in near-bank wet meadows as well as in the hyporheic zone. We show that the wet meadow groundwater was denitrified and that oxygen and nitrate were present around the stream channel in a wide zone on granite, compared with a very restricted zone on schist. On granite, exchanges between the stream and the hyporheic zone are favoured by sandy or peaty material having high hydraulic conductivity. This gives rise to two processes (1) lateral inflow of denitrified water from wet meadows, (2) in the opposite direction, supply of stream nitrate to denitrification sites in the hyporheic zone. In the second case, a high hydraulic conductivity also reduces the water residence time and limits denitrification, resulting in high levels of oxygen and nitrate. On schist, the low hydraulic conductivity prevents an efficient connection between surface and subsurface waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000089975600006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNitrate%2Bdepletion%2Bduring%2Bwithin-stream%2Btransport%253A%2BEffects%2Bof%2Bexchange%2Bprocesses%2Bbetween%2Bstreamwater%252C%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Band%2Briparian%2Bzones%26rft.aufirst%3DC%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DGrimaldi%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1005222513626%26rft.epage%3D112%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0049-6979%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BAND%2BSOIL%2BPOLLUTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D95-112%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D95%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BSOIL%2BPOLL%26rft.volume%3D124%26rft.au%3DGrimaldi%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DChaplot%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+AIR+AND+SOIL+POLLUTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
34,"Singh, HV",Jun 2018 ,"Floodplain restoration increases hyporheic flow in the Yakima River Watershed, Washington",ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Hyporheic exchange between a river channel and its floodplain region assists in mediating processes such as nutrient removal and temperature regulation. Floodplain restoration in the form of levee setbacks are often carried out to improve the hyporheic exchange. In this study Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were used along with the head data from observation wells and stage data from rivers to setup and calibrate a groundwater model for 458 km(2) of area within Gap to Gap reach of the Yakima River, WA. This area has witnessed several efforts of floodplain restoration in the form of levee setbacks. The groundwater model was used to quantify hyporheic flow emerging from the Yakima River in steady and transient states during pre-restoration (using LiDAR data of 2008) and post-restoration period (after levee setback using LiDAR data of 2013). The comparison of results from the model runs during pre and post-restoration periods showed that the length of the pathlines increased after levee setback for both steady and transient state model simulations. The largest increase of about 62 m was noticed in the month of September 2014 (pre: 398 m and post: 460 m). The study also showed that the direction of the flow changed following levee setback, expanding the area for hyporheic flux exchange between surface and groundwater. The model run during transient state also suggested that pathlines were longer during drier months compared to wet months. Overall, the study showed that levee setbacks improved the hyporheic connection between surface and groundwater in the Yakima floodplain which demonstrates that levee setback can provide a valuable hydrologic tool to restore ecosystem processes in previously leveed rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000428958100015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFloodplain%2Brestoration%2Bincreases%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYakima%2BRiver%2BWatershed%252C%2BWashington%26rft.aufirst%3DHarsh%2BVardhan%26rft.auinit%3DHV%26rft.aulast%3DSingh%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecoleng.2018.02.001%26rft.eissn%3D1872-6992%26rft.epage%3D120%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0925-8574%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D110-120%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D110%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D116%26rft.au%3DSingh%252C%2BHV%26rft.au%3DFaulkner%252C%2BBR%26rft.au%3DForshay%252C%2BKJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Based on patterns reported overseas we predict that down-welling waters will be similar to surface waters in chemical characteristics and epigean animals will be more common in down-welling waters than in up-wellings, which would have a different chemical signature to the surface waters and a fauna dominated by hypogean invertebrates. Conductivity, pH, and temperature of hyporheic water were least like those of surface waters at up-wellings in the groundwater-fed Makaretu River. Only 6% of the invertebrate fauna of these up-wellings comprised epigean animals. In contrast, in the groundwater-recharging Tukituki and Waipawa Rivers, hyporheic water chemistry was similar to that of surface water in down-wellings and 40% of the community comprised epigean animals by abundance. Significant increases (P < 0.05) in species diversity and taxonomic richness was also identified in down-welling zones compared with up-wellings. Species diversity and taxonomic richness were lowest in up-wellings in the Makaretu where hypogean animals dominated the hyporheic fauna.

36,"Soulsby, C",Nov-dec 2001 ,Hydrochemistry of the hyporheic zone in salmon spawning gravels: A preliminary assessment in a degraded agricultural stream,REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT,"Hydrochemical changes were monitored in a simulated, sea run salmon redd in a small agricultural stream in northeast Scotland following the 1998-1999 spawning season. Immediately after redd construction, the hydrochemical characteristics of hyporheic water, at depths of 0.1 m and 0.3 m, were very similar to stream water. These apparently well-mixed waters were alkaline, well-oxygenated and enriched in nutrients. In the weeks and months following redd construction, clear and statistically significant differences in the chemistry of stream and hyporheic waters were observed. Typically, hyporheic water had lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen (mean 7.35 mg L-1 at 0.3 m depth) than stream waters (mean = 11.26 mg L-1). Alkalinity, calcium, sulphate and conductivity levels tended to be higher in hyporheic waters, with concentrations increasing with depth. These data implied an increasing influence of groundwater with depth in the hyporheic zone following redd construction; an inference supported by subsequent hydraulic head measurements, which revealed an upwards groundwater flux in the stream bed. However, groundwater-surface water interactions were dynamic and complex: road salts eluted into the stream during periods of snowmelt simulated tracer experiments that implied that a reversed hydraulic gradient may occur at high flows with deeper streamwater penetration and mixing in the hyporheic zone. High flows also result in the mobilization of fine sediments from the stream bed which subsequently infiltrated into spawning gravels. These appear to cause `capping' of redds and probably reduce the hydraulic conductivity of the redd matrix. Infiltrating sediments also contain a small, but probably important organic component, the decomposition of which may contribute to oxygen consumption and nutrient mineralization in the hyporheic zone.

37,"Malcolm, IA",Feb 28 2003 ,Heterogeneity in ground water-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone of a salmonid spawning stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Spatial and temporal variability in ground water-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone of a salmonid spawning stream was investigated. Four locations in a 150-m reach of the stream were studied using hydrometric and hydrochemical tracing techniques. A high degree of hydrological connectivity between the riparian hillslope and the stream channel was indicated at two locations, where hydrochemical changes and hydraulic gradients indicated that the hyporheic zone was dominated by upwelling ground water. The chemistry of ground water reflected relatively long residence times and reducing conditions with high levels of alkalinity and conductivity, low dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate. At the other locations, connectivity was less evident and, at most times, the hyporheic zone was dominated by downwelling stream water characterized by high DO, low alkalinity and conductivity. Substantial variability in hyporheic chemistry was evident at fine (<10 m) spatial scales and changed rapidly over the course of hydrological events. The nature of the hydrochemical response varied among locations depending on the strength of local ground water influence. It is suggested that greater emphasis on spatial and temporal heterogeneity in ground water-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone is necessary for a consideration of hydrochemical effects on many aspects of stream ecology. For example, the survival of salmonid eggs in hyporheic gravels varied considerably among the locations studied and was shown to be associated with variation in interstitial chemistry. River restoration schemes and watershed management strategies based only on the surface expression of catchment characteristics risk excluding consideration of potentially critical subsurface processes.

39,"Iepure, S",Dec 2014 ,"Geochemical, geological and hydrological influence on ostracod assemblages distribution in the hyporheic zone of two Mediterranean rivers in central Spain",INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY,"On the catchment spatial scale, rivers can be considered a patchy discontinuity from headwaters to mouth with significant implications on the structure and functioning of the hyporheic zone (HZ) biota. The present study aims to determine the spatial variation of ostracod assemblages from a fluvial HZ of two groundwater-fed rivers of the Jarama basin (Central Spain). We hypothesised that ostracod abundance and composition are subject to changes in water condition, substratum type geology and surface water/groundwater exchanges along the hyporheic flow path. Individual measures of 29 physico-chemical parameters, water discharge, sediment size and sediment organic matter (as loss of ignition) were measured at a depth of 20-40cm at 20 hyporheic sites of the Henares and Tajuna Rivers. The results show that factors like elevation, carbonate water type, high permeable riverbed substratum and groundwater upwelling at headwaters contribute to shape a diverse, mixed assemblage formed by stygophyle and stygoxene ostracods (14 species). Conversely, low-mineralised waters, siliceous riverbeds with poor permeability, and relatively low surface/ground water exchanges in the middle and lower sectors, limit species diversity and ostracod abundance to exclusively stygoxene elements (nine species). Ostracod abundance correlates positively with fine sands (0.125-0.25mm) (Spearman, r=0.70), and negatively with temperature (r=-0.40), SO42- (r=-0.45) and Mg2+ (r=-0.40). Trace metal (Cu, Mn, Ni) accumulation in the intermediate and lower sectors of both rivers appears harmful for Ilyocypris brady (r=-0.46) and Pryonocypris zenkeri (r=-0.40), whereas As relates negatively to the abundance of Candona candida (r=-0.51), Pryonocypris zenkeri (r=-0.60) and Herpetocypris brevicaudata (r=-0.72). The results highlight the significance of recent ostracods as a proxy to assess the water conditions in a HZ and to provide forthcoming approaches to depict surface-subsurface hydrological exchanges.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000345999500004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGeochemical%252C%2Bgeological%2Band%2Bhydrological%2Binfluence%2Bon%2Bostracod%2Bassemblages%2Bdistribution%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Btwo%2BMediterranean%2Brivers%2Bin%2Bcentral%2BSpain%26rft.aufirst%3DSanda%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DIepure%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Firoh.201301727%26rft.eissn%3D1522-2632%26rft.epage%3D449%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1434-2944%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BREVIEW%2BOF%2BHYDROBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D435-449%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D435%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BREV%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D99%26rft.au%3DIepure%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DMeffe%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3Dde%2BBustamante%252C%2BI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+REVIEW+OF+HYDROBIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
40,"Bianchin, M",Jul 10 2010 ,Quantifying hyporheic exchange in a tidal river using temperature time series,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"An investigation into groundwater-surface water interaction (GSWI) beneath a large tidally influenced river was conducted to determine the effect of tides on the development of a hyporheic zone (HZ) and to quantify mixing of river water and groundwater. Temperature measurements, coupled with independent hydraulic head measurements, were used to detect groundwater flow within the riverbed. GWSI under tidal forcing produced a 1 m deep HZ. Time-averaged riverbed temperature profiles displayed a distinct compressed convex pattern: clear evidence of net groundwater discharge. However, the instantaneous time series data indicate that riverbed temperatures were affected by tidal forcing to a depth of 1 m. Heat transport modeling revealed that instantaneous velocities within the shallow sediments of the riverbed are rather high, creating a zone of vigorous exchange during either a flooding or ebbing tide. Furthermore, the magnitude of the tidal pressure gradient was found to be significantly greater than the pressure gradient expected across 0.8 m high dunes, evidence that bed-form-driven exchange under these conditions, and this scale of observation, did not contribute to the development of the HZ. Conditions for exchange induced by shear and current bed form are favorable during ebbing tidal conditions only; flow paths are therefore limited in depth. Exchange flow paths in an estuary setting are complex; they are limited in duration and space and dominated by tidal pumping.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000279827100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW07507%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Ba%2Btidal%2Briver%2Busing%2Btemperature%2Btime%2Bseries%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DBianchin%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009WR008365%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DBianchin%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DSmith%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DBeckie%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",Oct 15 2022 ,Drivers of functional diversity in the hyporheic zone of a large river,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The effects of regional (hydrogeology and geomorphology) and local (sediment and hydrology) characteristics on hyporheic assemblages were studied along a 40-km reach of a large gravel-bed river. Hyporheic water and fauna were sampled at the upstream and downstream positions of 15 large gravel bars. The resulting 30 stations varied in their sediment grain size, stability and direction of river-aquifer exchanges. The study concludes that at the 40-km (sector) scale, the longitudinal distribution of hyporheic fauna was controlled by 1) the hydrogeology of the valley (i.e. gaining vs loosing sectors) that modifies abundance and taxonomic richness of stygobites 2) current channel morphometry of the river (i.e. shape and location of meanders), and 3) historical changes (i.e. river incision) which modify abundance and richness of assemblages. At the local scale, we found that surface grain size and stability of the sediment evaluated by visual observation were poor predictors of hyporheos composition. In contrast, the local hydrology (i.e. downwellings, upwellings, low vertical exchanges) explained a large part of the abundance, taxonomic richness and composition of the hyporheic assemblages. Stations with low vertical exchanges were found poorly colonized, while the upwelling zones were rich in stygobites and downwelling areas harbor abundant and species-rich temporary hyporheos. It was also observed that functional diversity was controlled by the same parameters, with high relative abundances of stygobites in upwelling zones and POM feeders in downwelling zones. The heterogeneity of hydrological patterns, with alternation of upwellings and downwellings may represent the optimal spatial structure for hyporheic biodiversity conservation and resilience in rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000886029600016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B156985%26rft.atitle%3DDrivers%2Bof%2Bfunctional%2Bdiversity%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Blarge%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DMarie-Jose%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DDole-Olivier%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.scitotenv.2022.156985%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1026%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0048-9697%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENCE%2BOF%2BTHE%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D843%26rft.au%3DDole-Olivier%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DDes%2BChatelliers%252C%2BMC%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=SCIENCE+OF+THE+TOTAL+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Munz, M",Nov 15 2011 ,Reducing monitoring gaps at the aquifer-river interface by modelling groundwater-surface water exchange flow patterns,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This study investigates spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of aquifer-river exchange flow at a reach of the River Leith, UK. Observations of sub-channel vertical hydraulic gradients at the field site indicate the dominance of groundwater up-welling into the river and the absence of groundwater recharge from surface water. However, observed hydraulic heads do not provide information on potential surface water infiltration into the top 0-15 cm of the streambed as these depths are not covered by the existing experimental infrastructure. In order to evaluate whether surface water infiltration is likely to occur outside the 'window of detection', i.e. the shallow streambed, a numerical groundwater model is used to simulate hydrological exchanges between the aquifer and the river. Transient simulations of the successfully validated model (Nash and Sutcliff efficiency of 0.91) suggest that surface water infiltration is marginal and that the possibility of significant volumes of surface water infiltrating into non-monitored shallow streambed sediments can be excluded for the simulation period. Furthermore, the simulation results show that with increasing head differences between river and aquifer towards the end of the simulation period, the impact of streambed topography and hydraulic conductivity on spatial patterns of exchange flow rates decreases. A set of peak flow scenarios with altered groundwater-surface water head gradients is simulated in order to quantify the potential for surface water infiltration during characteristic winter flow conditions following the observation period. The results indicate that, particularly at the beginning of peak flow conditions, head gradients are likely to cause substantial increase in surface water infiltration into the streambed. The study highlights the potential for the improvement of process understanding of hyporheic exchange flow patterns at the stream reach scale by simulating aquifer-river exchange fluxes with a standard numerical groundwater model and a simple but robust model structure and parameterization.

43,"Azinheira, DL",Jul 2014 ,Comparison of effects of inset floodplains and hyporheic exchange induced by in-stream structures on solute retention,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The pollution of streams and rivers is a growing concern, and environmental guidance increasingly suggests stream restoration to improve water quality. Solute retention in off-channel storage zones, such as hyporheic zones and floodplains, is typically necessary for significant reaction to occur. Yet, the effects of two common restoration techniques, in-stream structures and inset floodplains, on solute retention have not been rigorously compared. We used MIKE SHE to model hydraulics and solute transport in the channel, on inset floodplains, and in structure-induced hyporheic zones of a third-order stream. We varied hydraulic conditions (winter base flow, summer base flow, and stormflow), geology (hydraulic conductivity), and stream restoration design parameters (inset floodplain length and presence of in-stream structures). The in-stream structures induced hyporheic exchange for approximately 20% of the year (during summer base flow) while inset floodplains were active for approximately 1% of the year (during stormflow). Flow onto inset floodplains and residence times in both the channel and on the floodplains increased nonlinearly with the fraction of bank with floodplains installed. The fraction of streamflow that flowed onto the inset floodplains was 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than that which flowed through the structure-induced hyporheic zone. Yet, residence times and mass storage in the hyporheic zone were 1-5 orders of magnitude larger than that on individual inset floodplains. In our modeling, neither in-stream structures nor inset floodplains had sufficient percent flow and residence times simultaneously to have a substantial impact on dissolved contaminants flowing downstream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000342632000046,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DComparison%2Bof%2Beffects%2Bof%2Binset%2Bfloodplains%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Binduced%2Bby%2Bin-stream%2Bstructures%2Bon%2Bsolute%2Bretention%26rft.aufirst%3DDavid%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DDL%26rft.aulast%3DAzinheira%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR014400%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6190%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6168-6190%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6168%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DAzinheira%252C%2BDL%26rft.au%3DScott%252C%2BDT%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
44,"Liu, SN",Nov 30 2019 ,Numerical modelling to evaluate the nitrogen removal rate in hyporheic zone and its implications for stream management,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays a vital role in the stream ecosystem. Reactions in the HZ such as denitrification and nitrification have been examined in previous studies. However, no numerical model has yet been developed that can accurately simulate nitrogen concentration changes in the HZ, because the zones for the two reactions can change throughout the reactions. This study proposes a method of evaluating the nitrogen removal rate in the HZ through numerical modelling. First, a basic two-dimensional numerical model coupling flow conditions with biochemical reactions is proposed to consider both nitrification and denitrification. The zones for different reactions are determined under the assumption that related environmental variables (i.e., the dissolved oxygen) will not change throughout the reactions. Next, to examine changes in environmental variables throughout the reactions, an improved model is proposed, and a method is developed for delineating the boundary between nitrification and denitrification zones and identifying a transition zone where either reaction might take place. However, more information about biochemical reactions in the HZ is required to use the improved model. To overcome this shortcoming, a new model that couples the basic model and genetic programming (GP) is proposed to optimize the simulation results of the basic model and allow for real-time forecasting. The results show that the basic model obtains acceptable simulation results for nitrate concentration distribution in the HZ. The improved model performs better than the basic model, but the model coupling the basic model with GP performs best. In addition, the function of the HZ in nitrogen removal is examined through a case study of four scenarios, leading to the conclusion that the HZ has a higher nitrogen removal rate when water quality is neither too poor nor too good. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the HZ and can benefit the restoration and management of HZs and streams in the face of the continual degradation caused by human activity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000479331200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNumerical%2Bmodelling%2Bto%2Bevaluate%2Bthe%2Bnitrogen%2Bremoval%2Brate%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Band%2Bits%2Bimplications%2Bfor%2Bstream%2Bmanagement%26rft.aufirst%3DSuning%26rft.auinit%3DSN%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13548%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D3097%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D24%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3084-3097%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3084%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D33%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BSN%26rft.au%3DChui%252C%2BTFM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

An accurate representation of topographical variations of the stream-streambed interface is therefore essential in analytical models in order to represent the couplings between hydrological and biogeochemical processes correctly. The classical Toth approach replaces the streambed surface topography by a flat surface which is identical to a truncation of the original physical flow domain into a rectangle. This simplification can lead to biased estimates of hyporheic flow and nutrient cycling within hyporheic systems. We present an alternative analytical modeling approach for solving hyporheic problems without domain truncation that explicitly accounts for topographical variations of the streambed. The presented approach is based on the application of perturbation theory. Applications of the method to hyporheic systems, ranging from the centimeter-scale of rippled bedforms to riffle structures of 10 m and larger scale, indicate a high accuracy of the approach.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000451631300029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAnalytical%2Bmodeling%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bfor%2Bin-stream%2Bbedforms%253A%2BPerturbation%2Bmethod%2Band%2Bimplementation%26rft.aufirst%3DSven%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFrei%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.envsoft.2018.09.015%26rft.eissn%3D1873-6726%26rft.epage%3D385%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1364-8152%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMODELLING%2B%2526%2BSOFTWARE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D375-385%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D375%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMODELL%2BSOFTW%26rft.volume%3D111%26rft.au%3DFrei%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DAzizian%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DToundykov%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MODELLING+%26+SOFTWARE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
46,"Zanatta, RC",Jun 30 2013 ,"The influence of hyporheic exchange on reach-scale water budgets in a Precambrian Shield catchment, Quebec, Canada",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The influence of hyporheic exchange on water and solute budgets of streams is widely identified as important; yet, there is a notable absence of research identifying its role in Precambrian Shield headwater streams. This research addressed this shortcoming by quantifying the proportions of solute mass loss, net and gross water gains and losses for selected reaches over a single summer recession period. Six conservative tracer injections were performed on nine reaches of a 2.94-km2 catchment in Gatineau Park, Quebec, Canada, from July to November, 2011. High solute exchange occurred for all reaches despite most showing positive net discharge. Solute losses in stream reaches typically exceeded 10%, and substantial gross water losses and gains indicate a high degree of bi-directional water exchange along stream reaches. Both solute loss and the fraction of channel water involved in hyporheic exchange increased throughout the summer in response to a decrease in discharge and increase in the time of contact. Results support the assertion that reductions in groundwater contributions to streamflow throughout the summer baseflow period allow for greater exchange of water through hyporheic flowpaths, which constitute the majority of gross channel losses and gains. Spatial (inter-reach) variability in mass loss has been previously ascribed to watershed control on exchange potential. In this catchment, net discharge and gross hydrologic gains were inversely related to the average flowpath gradients within the valley bottom and local hillslope contributing areas.

We monitored streamwater and streambed sediment porewaters from White Clay Creek (WCC), SE Pennsylvania, for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and conductivity to investigate organic matter processing within the hyporheic zone. Dissolved organic carbon and DO concentrations were higher in the streamwater than in the porewaters and, in many cases, concentrations continued to diminish with increasing depth into the streambed.2. Hydrological exchange data demonstrated that the permeability of the stream bed declines with depth and constrains downwelling, effectively isolating porewaters >30 cm from streamwater.3. End-member mixing analysis (EMMA) based on conductivity documented a DOC source and DO sink in the hyporheic zone. We calculated hyporheic streambed DOC fluxes and respiration from the EMMA results and estimates of water flux. Based upon our calculations of biodegradable DOC entering the hyporheic zone, we estimate that DOC supports 39% of the hyporheic zone respiration, with the remaining 61% presumably being supported by entrained particulate organic carbon. Hyporheic respiration averaged 0.38 g C m(-2) d(-1) , accounted for 41% of whole ecosystem respiration, and increased baseflow ecosystem efficiency from 46 to 59%.4. Advective transport of labile organic molecules into the streambed concentrates microbial activity in near-surface regions of the hyporheic zone. Steep gradients in biogeochemical activity could explain how a shallow and hydrologically constrained hyporheic zone can dramatically influence organic matter processing at the ecosystem scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000182948500005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmixing%2Bmodel%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bsolute%2Bdynamics%2Band%2Bthe%2Bcontribution%2Bof%2Ba%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bto%2Becosystem%2Bfunction%26rft.aufirst%3DTJ%26rft.auinit%3DTJ%26rft.aulast%3DBattin%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.2003.01062.x%26rft.epage%3D1014%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D995-1014%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D995%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DBattin%252C%2BTJ%26rft.au%3DKaplan%252C%2BLA%26rft.au%3DHendricks%252C%2BSP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D3jWybG240azZugnCgwX&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Marzadri, A",Dec 12 2013 ,Quantifying the importance of daily stream water temperature fluctuations on the hyporheic thermal regime: Implication for dissolved oxygen dynamics,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Water temperature is a primary driver of aquatic organism migration, drift, growth and metabolism in both stream and hyporheic zone. Here, we focus on the role of the naturally occurring daily stream water temperature oscillations on the hyporheic thermal regime and on dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics within the hyporheic zone. We choose DO as target dissolved element because of its importance for aquatic habitat quality and its role in controlling biogeochemical reactions and pool-riffle morphology as bed form because of its ubiquity and ecological relevance. To address the first objective, we introduce a new thermal Damkohler number, Da(T), which is the ratio between the median residence time of stream water and the time scale of daily amplitude attenuation of water temperature within the hyporheic zone. Application of the model to a wide range of pool-riffle dimensions shows the dependence of hyporheic water temperature distribution on hyporheic residence time. The latter is a function of the interaction between stream flow and bed form morphology. Our results show that Da(T) increases with stream size indicating that large streams have more thermally stable hyporheic zones than small streams. To address the second objective, we analytically solve the heat and dissolved oxygen transport equations through the stream-bed sediment with isotropic and homogeneous hydraulic properties by means of a Lagrangian approach, under the hypothesis that transverse dispersion can be neglected and the DO reaction rate is temperature dependant. We apply these coupled transport models to characterize the distribution of DO concentrations within the hyporheic zone. This analysis shows a relation between the patterns of water temperature and of DO concentrations with important feedbacks on the life and metabolism of aquatic organisms; as well as on the reaction rates, which control the biogeochemical processes within the streambed sediment. We analyze the effects of temperature variations on the kinetics of DO assuming constant and periodic fluctuations of DO concentrations in the stream water. Our results show that for streams with pool and riffle morphology, the latter effect is more important than that of temperature dependent reaction rates. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

49,"Sheibley, RW",Sep 2003 ,"Numerical modeling of coupled nitrification-denitrification in sediment perfusion cores from the hyporheic zone of the Shingobee River, MN",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Nitrification and denitrification kinetics in sediment perfusion cores were numerically modeled and compared to experiments on cores from the Shingobee River MN, USA. The experimental design incorporated mixing groundwater discharge with stream water penetration into the cores, which provided a well-defined, one-dimensional simulation of in situ hydrologic conditions. Ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) concentration gradients suggested the upper region of the cores supported coupled nitrification dentrification, where groundwater-derived NH4+ was first oxidised to NO3- then subsequently reduced via denitrification to N-2. Nitrification and denitrification were modeled using a Crank-Nicolson finite difference approximation to a one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation. Both processes were modeled using first-order reaction kinetics because substrate concentrations (NH4+ and NO3) were much smaller than published Michaelis constants. Rate coefficients for nitrification and denitrification ranged from 0.2 to 15.8 h(-1) and 0.02 to 8.0 h(-1), respectively. The rate constants followed an Arrhenius relationship between 7.5 and 22 degreesC. Activation energies for nitrification and denitrification were 162 and 97.3 kJ/mol, respectively. Seasonal NH4+ concentration patterns in the Shingobee River were accurately simulated from the relationship between perfusion core temperature and NH4+ flux to the overlying water. The simulations suggest that NH4+ in groundwater discharge is controlled by sediment nitrification that, consistent with its activation energy, is strongly temperature dependent.
