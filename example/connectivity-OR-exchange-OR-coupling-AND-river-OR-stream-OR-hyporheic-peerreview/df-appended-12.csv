0,0,"Alexander, MD",Jan-feb 2003 ,Variability and comparison of hyporheic water temperatures and seepage fluxes in a small Atlantic salmon stream,GROUND WATER,"Ground water discharge is often a significant factor in the quality of fish spawning and rearing habitat and for highly biologically productive streams. In the present study, water temperatures (stream and hyporheic) and seepage fluxes were used to characterize shallow ground water discharge and recharge within the streambed of Catamaran Brook, a small Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stream in central New Brunswick, Canada. Three study sites were instrumented using a total of 10 temperature sensors and 18 seepage meters. Highly variable mean seepage fluxes, ranging from 1.7 X 10(-4) to 2.5 cm(3) m(-2) sec(-1), and mean hyporheic water temperatures, ranging from 10.5degrees to 18.0degreesC, at depths of 20 to 30 cm in the streambed were dependent on streambed location (left versus right stream bank and site location) and time during the summer sampling season. Temperature data were useful for determining if an area of the streambed was under discharge (positive flux), recharge (negative flux), or parallel flow (no flux) conditions and seepage meters were used to directly measure the quantity of water flux. Hyporheic water temperature measurements and specific conductance measurements of the seepage meter sample water, mean values ranging from 68.8 to 157.9 muS/cm, provided additional data for determining flux sources. Three stream banks were consistently under discharge conditions, while the other three stream banks showed reversal from discharge to recharge conditions over the sampling season. Results indicate that the majority of the water collected in the seepage meters was composed of surface water. The data obtained suggests that even though a positive seepage flux is often interpreted as ground water discharge, this discharging water may be of stream water origin that has recently entered the hyporheic zone. The measurement of seepage flux in conjunction with hyporheic water temperature or other indicators of water origin should be considered when attempting to quantify the magnitude of exchange and the source of hyporheic water.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000180367700013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariability%2Band%2Bcomparison%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bwater%2Btemperatures%2Band%2Bseepage%2Bfluxes%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsmall%2BAtlantic%2Bsalmon%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DMD%26rft.auinit%3DMD%26rft.aulast%3DAlexander%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1745-6584.2003.tb02570.x%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D82%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D72-82%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D72%26rft.stitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DAlexander%252C%2BMD%26rft.au%3DCaissie%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=GROUND+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1745-6584.2003.tb02570.x,,"TROUT SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS,BROOK TROUT,GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,TIME-SERIES,LAKE,INCUBATION,RIVER,FLOW,EMERGENCE,EXCHANGE",,"Univ New Brunswick, Groundwater Studies Grp, Dept Civil Engn, POB 4400, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada"
1,1,"Mignot, E",Jun 2017 ,Measurement of mass exchange processes and coefficients in a simplified open-channel lateral cavity connected to a main stream,ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS,"Lateral cavities are major storage zones in riverine environments for which the mass exchanges with the main stream strongly impact the characteristics of the habitat in these dead zones. An experimental work is presented here with a controlled main stream and a connected open-channel lateral cavity to assess the processes responsible for these exchanges and to quantify the exchange capacities. In a first step, the measurements of passive scalar transport allow us to identify the physical processes involved in the exchange of mass from the main stream and its spreading within the cavity. In a second step, the quantitative mass exchange coefficient, representative of the exchange capacity, is measured for 28 flow and cavity configurations. The sensibility analysis to the governing parameters proposed by the dimensional analysis then reveals that changing the geometric aspect ratio of the cavity does not affect the exchange coefficient while increasing the normalized water depth or decreasing the Reynolds number of the main stream tend to increase this coefficient. Indeed, these parameters modify both the growth rate of the mixing layer width at the interface and the amplitude of the alternating transverse velocity across the interface, thus affecting the exchange capacities from the main stream to the cavity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000405630800002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMeasurement%2Bof%2Bmass%2Bexchange%2Bprocesses%2Band%2Bcoefficients%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsimplified%2Bopen-channel%2Blateral%2Bcavity%2Bconnected%2Bto%2Ba%2Bmain%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DEmmanuel%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DMignot%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10652-016-9495-7%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1510%26rft.epage%3D448%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1567-7419%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BFLUID%2BMECHANICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D429-448%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D429%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BFLUID%2BMECH%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DMignot%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DCai%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DRiviere%252C%2BN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+FLUID+MECHANICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10652-016-9495-7,"Mass exchange,Turbulent diffusion,Cavity,Exchange coefficient,Dye release method","FLOW,OSCILLATIONS,DISPERSION,FIELDS",,"Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, CNRS, LMFA UMR5509, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France"
2,2,"Gonzalez-Pinzon, R",Jan 2016 ,Nighttime and daytime respiration in a headwater stream,ECOHYDROLOGY,"We investigated changes in respiration across nighttime and daytime in a headwater stream. For this, we conducted consecutive nighttime and daytime experiments injecting the bioreactive tracer resazurin in two reaches with different riparian canopy densities (different levels of photosynthetically active radiation) to compare respiration rate coefficients. We found that even though stream water temperatures measured above the streambed at day and night (half-day timescale) were different within each reach and across reaches (95% confidence level), apparent respiration rate coefficients were not different across nighttime and daytime conditions (95% confidence level). A likely explanation for this is that the bulk of stream respiration takes place in the hyporheic zone, where diel fluctuations of stream temperature and photosynthetically active radiation are considerably attenuated and where temperature is not measured in routine investigations of stream metabolism. Our results suggest that community respiration in headwater streams may not need to be corrected' for temperature between daytime and nighttime, even though instantaneous changes in respiration are expected to occur from a pure biological perspective.

3,3,"Gunduz, O",2007 ,The influence of stream bed hydraulic conductivity on sustaining baseflow in rivers,WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"This study presents the results of the influence of stream bed hydraulic conductivity on baseflow sustainability by using a coupled model of surface and subsurface hydrology. The model provides a coupled solution to the dynamic interactions between a river and a surfacial aquifer and is used to numerically study the effect of stream bed conductivity on the overall system response. To achieve this objective, the model is formulated to include a one-dimensional river flow model and a two-dimensional vertically averaged groundwater flow model in an unconfined aquifer. The coupling is achieved at the river bed via a hydraulic flux that is described as a function of river bed conductivity and the gradient between river stage and groundwater head. The model incorporates the concept of simultaneous presence of the two hydrologic processes for simulating the dynamic interactions and uses a novel numerical technique to solve the two systems concurrently. These interactions are analyzed by numerical experimentation under different hydraulic conductivity conditions. The influence of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient is studied under steady and unsteady flow regimes to assess the occurrence of baseflow. The analysis also reveals critical insights into the governing mechanisms that provide and sustain the baseflow in rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000248734900031,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bbed%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bon%2Bsustaining%2Bbaseflow%2Bin%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DO.%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DGunduz%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fwst.2007.460%26rft.eissn%3D1996-9732%26rft.epage%3D266%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0273-1223%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D259-266%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D259%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D56&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER+SCIENCE+AND+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/wst.2007.460,"baseflow,coupled surface/subsurface flow model,hydraulic conductivity,stream bed","WATER FLOW,MODEL",,"Dokuz Eylul Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Tinaztepe Campus, TR-35160 Izmir, Turkey"
4,4,"Krause, S",Jul 2011 ,Inter-disciplinary perspectives on processes in the hyporheic zone,ECOHYDROLOGY,"The interface between groundwater and surface water within riverine/riparian ecosystems-the hyporheic zone (HZ)-is experiencing a rapid growth of research interest from a range of scientific disciplines, often with different perspectives. The majority of the multi-disciplinary research aims to elucidate HZ process dynamics and their importance for surface water and groundwater ecohydrology and biogeochemical cycling. This paper presents a critical inter-disciplinary review of recent advances of research centred on the HZ and highlights the current state of knowledge regarding hydrological, biogeochemical and ecohydrological process understanding. The spatial and temporal variability of surface water and groundwater exchange (hyporheic exchange flows), biogeochemical cycling and heat exchange (thermal regime) are considered in relation to both experimental measurements and modelling of these phenomena. We explore how this knowledge has helped to increase our understanding of HZ ecohydrology, and particularly its invertebrate community, the processing of organic matter, trophic cascading and ecosystem engineering by macrophytes and other organisms across a range of spatial and temporal scales. In addition to providing a detailed review of HZ functions, we present an inter-disciplinary perspective on how to advance and integrate HZ process understanding across traditional discipline boundaries. We therefore attempt to highlight knowledge gaps and research needs within the individual disciplines and demonstrate how innovations and advances in research, made within traditional subject-specific boundaries (e.g. hydrology, biochemistry and ecology), can be used to enhance inter-disciplinary scientific progress by cross-system comparisons and fostering of greater dialogue between scientific disciplines.

Its hydrological, chemical, biological and metabolic features are specific of this zone, not belonging truly neither to surface-nor to groundwater. Exchanges of water, nutrients, and organic matter occur in response to variations in discharge and bed topography and porosity. Dynamic gradients exist at all scales and vary temporally. Across all scales, the functional significance of the HZ relates to its activity and connection with the surface stream. The HZ is a relatively rich environment and almost all invertebrate groups have colonized this habitat. This fauna, so-called hyporheos, is composed of species typical from interstitial environment, and also of benthic epigean and phreatic species. The hyporheic microbiocenose consists in bacteria, archaea, protozoa and fungi. The HZ provides several ecosystem services, playing a pivotal role in mediating exchange processes, including both matter and energy, between surface and subterranean ecosystems, functioning as regulator of water flow, benthic invertebrates refuge and place of storage, source and transformation of organic matter. The hyporheic zone is one of the most threatened aquatic environments, being strongly influenced by human activities, and the least protected by legislation worldwide. Its maintenance and conservation is compelling in order to preserve the ecological interconnectivity among the three spatial dimensions of the aquatic environment. Although several researchers addressed the importance of the hyporheic zone early, and most contemporary stream ecosystem models explicitly include it, very little is known about the HZ of Neotropical regions. From a biological standpoint, hyporheos fauna in Neotropical regions are still largely underestimated. This review focuses on a brief presentation of the hyporheic zone and its functions and significance as an ecotone. We also highlighted the key aspects considering also the current status of research in Neotropical regions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000362733300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Band%2Bits%2Bfunctions%253A%2Brevision%2Band%2Bresearch%2Bstatus%2Bin%2BNeotropical%2Bregions%26rft.aufirst%3DR.%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DMugnai%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1590%252F1519-6984.15413%26rft.eissn%3D1678-4375%26rft.epage%3D534%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1519-6984%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBRAZILIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D524-534%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D524%26rft.stitle%3DBRAZ%2BJ%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D75%26rft.au%3DMugnai%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DMessana%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DDi%2BLorenzo%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=BRAZILIAN+JOURNAL+OF+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1590/1519-6984.15413,"Enterobacteriaceae,groundwater,meiofauna,macroinvertebrates,water exchange","GLOBAL DIVERSITY,GROUNDWATER ECOLOGY,COPEPODS CRUSTACEA,LOTIC DISTURBANCE,ESCHERICHIA-COLI,STREAM,RIVER,REFUGE,ASSEMBLAGES,DYNAMICS",,"Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Invertebrados, Museu Nacl, Lab Aracnol, Quinta da Boa Vista S-N, BR-20940040 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil"
6,6,"Marmonier, P",Nov 1 2019 ,Does spatial heterogeneity of hyporheic fauna vary similarly with natural and artificial changes in braided river width?,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Heterogeneity of hyporheic fauna is associated with geomorphological features and related vertical water exchanges. Constrictions on river floodplain are known to induce groundwater inputs and increase stygobite fauna. Two floodplain constrictions were studied in a large braided river (the Drome River): one linked to a natural process (valley narrowing), another to an artificial river regulation (early 20th embankment). Spatial distribution of hyporheic organisms were sampled upstream and downstream of the two constrained sections, at 9 stations, 3 positions (left and right sides, centre of the braided strip), 3 replication points and at a depth of 50 cm in the river sediment. The spatial heterogeneity in community composition was higher near the banks than at the centre of the braided strip, no matter the width of the strip. The artificial constriction induced a decrease in spatial heterogeneity of the benthic fraction of the hyporheic fauna, but no changes were detected for the stygofauna. The natural valley narrowing reduced width and thickness of the alluvium and induced an inflow of groundwater resulting in an increase in stygofauna abundance. Natural floodplain narrowing linked to geology thus control the distribution of stygobite species, while artificial constrictions only modify the spatial distribution of the benthic fraction of the hyporheic fauna.

Here we used remotely sensed meter-scale channel bathymetry for a 13.5km reach of Chinook salmon spawning stream in central Idaho to describe habitat quality and set boundary conditions for a two-dimensional surface water model coupled with a three-dimensional hyporheic flux model. Metrics describing ambient hyporheic flow intensity and habitat quality, which is quantified as a function of stream hydraulics and morphology, were compared to the locations of nests built by female salmon. Nest locations were predicted most accurately by habitat quality followed by channel morphology (i.e., riffles location). As a lesser degree than habitat quality, water surface curvature was also a good indicator of spawning location because its intensity can identify riffle morphology. The ambient hyporheic flow predicted at meter-scale resolution was not a strong predictor of redd site selection. Furthermore, the study suggests direct morphological measurements obtained from easily measured channel bathymetry data could enable effective and rapid assessments of salmon spawning channels across broad areas.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000378703200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bhabitat%2Bquality%2Band%2Bambient%2Bhyporheic%2Bflows%2Bon%2Bsalmon%2Bspawning%2Bsite%2Bselection%26rft.aufirst%3DRohan%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DBenjankar%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015JG003079%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D1235%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1222-1235%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1222%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D121%26rft.au%3DBenjankar%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DIsaak%252C%2BDJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015JG003079,"salmonid species,spawning habitat,redd,habitat quality,surface water curvature,hyporheic flow","FALL CHINOOK SALMON,EGG BURIAL DEPTHS,REDD-SITE,SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS,EMBRYO SURVIVAL,MOKELUMNE RIVER,COLUMBIA RIVER,BROOK TROUT,EXCHANGE,STREAM",,"Univ Idaho, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, Boise, ID 83706 USA"
8,8,"Deng, ZQ",Sep 2010 ,Effect of channel size on solute residence time distributions in rivers,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The effect of channel size on residence time distributions (RTDs) of solute in rivers is investigated in this paper using tracer test data and the variable residence time (VART) model. Specifically, the investigation focuses on the influence of shear dispersion and hyporheic exchange on the shape of solute RID, and how these two transport processes prevail in larger and smaller streams, respectively, leading to distinct tails of RID. Simulation results show that (1) RTDs are dispersion-dependent and thereby channel-size (scale) dependent. RTDs increasing longitudinal dispersion coefficient. Small streams with negligible dispersion coefficient may display various types of RID from upward curving patterns to a straight line (power-law distributions) and further to downward curving lognormal distributions when plotted in log-log coordinates. Moderate-sized rivers are transitional in terms of RTDs and commonly exhibit lognormal and power-law RTDs; (2) the incorporation of water and solute losses/gains in the VART model can improve simulation results and make parameter values more reasonable; (3) the ratio of time to peak concentration to the minimum mean residence time is equal to the recovery ratio of tracer. The relation provides a simple method for determining the minimum mean residence time; and (4) the VART model is able to reproduce various RTDs observed in rivers with 3-4 fitting parameters while no user-specified RID functions are needed.

9,9,"Pan, Y",Nov 2015 ,A coupled stream flow and depth-integrated subsurface flow model for catchment hydrology,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Few hydrological models that couple stream flow and subsurface flow in shallow aquifers are based on a compromise between simple and complex depiction of the system, although this compromise could result in tractable tools for various applications. We present a depth-integrated approach in which flows in the vadose and saturated zones are assumed to be parallel to the bottom of the aquifer and thus are integrated in the direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer. The hydrodynamic parameters are also integrated in this direction, and gravity effects are preserved. Stream flow is handled by a diffusive-wave equation that is calculated over a network of one-dimensional bonds. The first-order coupling between the stream and subsurface flows exchanges water fluxes between the stream network and the subsurface compartment according to the hydraulic head differences between the systems. Three synthetic test cases, one including a comparison with a three-dimensional code, are used to evaluate the general behavior of the coupled model. It is shown that the approach reproduces the main hydrological features at the catchment scale, including the generation of runoff, infiltration exfiltration into (from) the vadose zone, and smooth transient head variations in the aquifer.

In particular, hyporheic temperatures have a great impact on many temperature-sensitive microbial processes. In this study, we used 3-D coupled water flow and heat transport simulations applying the HydroGeoSphere code in combination with high-resolution observations of hydraulic heads and temperatures to quantify reach-scale water and heat flux across the river-groundwater interface and hyporheic temperature dynamics of a lowland gravel bed river. The model was calibrated in order to constrain estimates of the most sensitive model parameters. The magnitude and variations of the simulated temperatures matched the observed ones, with an average mean absolute error of 0.7 degrees C and an average Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.87. Our results indicate that nonsubmerged streambed structures such as gravel bars cause substantial thermal heterogeneity within the saturated sediment at the reach scale. Individual hyporheic flow path temperatures strongly depend on the flow path residence time, flow path depth, river, and groundwater temperature. Variations in individual hyporheic flow path temperatures were up to 7.9 degrees C, significantly higher than the daily average (2.8 degrees C), but still lower than the average seasonal hyporheic temperature difference (19.2 degrees C). The distribution between flow path temperatures and residence times follows a power law relationship with exponent of about 0.37. Based on this empirical relation, we further estimated the influence of hyporheic flow path residence time and temperature on oxygen consumption which was found to partly increase by up to 29% in simulations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000418736700014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2BLong-Term%2BSimulation%2Bof%2BReach-Scale%2BWater%2Band%2BHeat%2BFluxes%2BAcross%2Bthe%2BRiver-Groundwater%2BInterface%2Bfor%2BRetrieving%2BHyporheic%2BResidence%2BTimes%2Band%2BTemperature%2BDynamics%26rft.aufirst%3DMatthias%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DMunz%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR020667%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D8924%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D8900-8924%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D8900%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DMunz%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DOswald%252C%2BSE%26rft.au%3DSchmidt%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017WR020667,,"1ST-ORDER EXCHANGE COEFFICIENT,GLOBAL SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS,SURFACE-SUBSURFACE FLOW,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN,NONUNIFORM FLOW,THERMAL REGIME,STREAM WATER,ZONE,AQUIFER",,"Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany"
11,11,"Yang, C",Sep 2018 ,Model-Based Analysis of the Effects of Dam-Induced River Water and Groundwater Interactions on Hydro-Biogeochemical Transformation of Redox Sensitive Contaminants in a Hyporheic Zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone (HZ) may retard the contaminants migration from groundwater to the river and vice versa. Anthropogenic activities may further complicate such processes. This study investigated the effects of dam-induced hydrodynamics on biogeochemical transformation of contaminants using Cr as an example in the HZ of the Columbia River at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site. The flow velocities in the HZ were first simulated using the measured or averaged groundwater level and river stage at hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly time scales. The flow velocities were then incorporated into a reactive transport model with independently characterized biogeochemical reactions and kinetics. Simulation results indicated that hydrodynamics can significantly influence the rate and extent of Cr (VI) biogeochemical transformation, which was mainly controlled by the kinetic reduction of Cr (VI) to sparely soluble Cr (III) by sediment-associated Fe (II) that can be regenerated by microorganisms with organic carbon as electron donor. The frequent flow direction reversals in the HZ induced by dam operations enhanced the rate of microbial consumption of bioavailable OC, which, if there was no organic carbon supply, can eventually terminate the Fe (II) regeneration mechanism and exhaust the HZ's redox capacity in reducing Cr (VI) to Cr (III). This study demonstrated the importance of hydrodynamics on biogeochemical transformation of contaminants in the HZ and of the time scales used in assessing the reactive transport of chemicals and contaminants in the HZ as the net supply of redox sensitive chemicals such as dissolved oxygen into the HZ is a function of the frequency of flow direction reversal.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000448088100008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModel-Based%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2Bthe%2BEffects%2Bof%2BDam-Induced%2BRiver%2BWater%2Band%2BGroundwater%2BInteractions%2Bon%2BHydro-Biogeochemical%2BTransformation%2Bof%2BRedox%2BSensitive%2BContaminants%2Bin%2Ba%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DChen%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DYang%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR023286%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D5985%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5973-5985%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5973%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BYK%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BCX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR023286,"anthropogenic activities,river water and groundwater interactions,reactive transport,coupled hydrology and biogeochemistry,retardation capacity,hyporheic zone","FLOW,EXCHANGE,ECOLOGY,STREAM,ATTENUATION,STAGE",,"Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Prov Key Lab Soil & Groundwater Pollut Control, Shenzhen, Peoples R China"
12,12,"Yu, K",Jan 2020 ,"Watershed-scale distributions of heavy metals in the hyporheic zones of a heavily polluted Maozhou River watershed, southern China",CHEMOSPHERE,"Hyporheic zone (HZ) sediments in river systems are often contaminated with heavy metals as a legacy of natural processes and anthropogenic activities. The geochemical behaviors of heavy metals in the HZ sediments at the laboratory scale have been extensively studied. However, the watershed-scale distributions of heavy metals in the HZ sediments and the processes controlling their distributions have not been well studied. Here, we report a watershed-scale study of heavy metals (i.e., Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) distributions in the HZ of the Maozhou River watershed, a heavily polluted area within the Pearl River Delta, southern China. Statistical analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of studied heavy metal concentrations was highly correlated with that of the sediment-associated sulfide at the watershed-scale. Metal extraction analysis and double-spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope imaging (Cs-STEM) further confirmed the strong association of heavy metals with sulfur. These observations demonstrated that the formation of metals-sulfide precipitates was the key process controlling the watershed-scale distributions of heavy metals (especially for Cr, Ni and Zn) in the HZ sediments. Additionally, high permeability of the HZ sediments may prevent Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb accumulation in sediments. Specially, Cu distribution was mainly affected by organic-Cu complexation. In the estuary area, salinity input likely affected the distributions of Ni, Zn and Cd through cation exchange processes. The findings improved our understanding of the distributions of heavy metals and the processes controlling their distributions at the watershed-scale, and have implications for remediating and managing contaminated HZ sediments.

Disentangling hyporheic influences on temperature cycles in stream channels",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We monitored summertime base flow water temperatures of hyporheic discharge to surface water in main, side, and spring channels located within the bank-full scour zone of the gravel-and cobble-bedded Umatilla River, Oregon, USA. Diel temperature cycles in hyporheic discharge were common, but spatially variable. Relative to the main channel's diel cycle, hyporheic discharge locations typically had similar daily mean temperatures, but smaller diel ranges (compressed by 2 to 6 degrees C) and desynchronized phases (offset by 0 to 6 h). In spring channels (which received only hyporheic discharge), surface water diel cycles were also compressed (by 2 to 6 degrees C) and desynchronized (by -4 to 6 h) relative to the main channel, creating diverse daytime and nighttime mosaics of surface water temperatures across main, side, and spring channels, despite only minor differences (<1 degrees C) in daily mean temperatures among the channels. The river's hyporheic zone received and stored heat from the channel, yet hyporheic return flows carried heat back to the channel minutes to months after removal. Associated surface water temperature dynamics were therefore complex. Hyporheic discharge was not simply ""cooler'' or ""warmer'' than main channel water. Instead, instantaneous temperature differences between channel water and hyporheic discharge typically arose from diel temperature cycles in hyporheic discharge that were buffered and lagged relative to diel cycles in the main channel.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000259206200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW09418%26rft.atitle%3DBuffered%252C%2Blagged%252C%2Bor%2Bcooled%253F%2BDisentangling%2Bhyporheic%2Binfluences%2Bon%2Btemperature%2Bcycles%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bchannels%26rft.aufirst%3DAlicia%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DArrigoni%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2007WR006480%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DArrigoni%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DPoole%252C%2BGC%26rft.au%3DThomas%252C%2BSA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2007WR006480,,"SURFACE-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,FALL CHINOOK SALMON,THERMAL HETEROGENEITY,GROUND-WATER,FLOW PATHS,RIVER,HABITAT,OREGON,VARIABILITY",,"Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, POB 173120, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA"
14,14,"Bardini, L",May 1 2012 ,Nutrient cycling in bedform induced hyporheic zones,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,"The hyporheic zone is an ecotone connecting the stream and groundwater ecosystem that plays a significant role for stream biogeochemistry. Water exchange across the stream-sediment interface and biogeochemical reactions in the streambed concur to affect subsurface solute concentrations and eventually nutrient cycling in the fluvial corridor. In this paper we investigate the interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes in a duned streambed and their effect on spatial distribution of solutes. We employ a numerical model to simulate the turbulent water flow and the pressure distribution over the dunes, and then to evaluate the flow field and the biogeochemical reactions in the hyporheic sediments. Sensitivity analyses are performed to analyze the influence of hydrological and chemical properties of the system on solute reaction rates. The results demonstrate the effect of stream velocity and sediment permeability on the chemical zonation. Changing sediment permeability as well as stream velocity directly affects the nutrient supply and the residence times in the streambed, thus controlling the reaction rates under the dune. Stream-water quality is also shown to influence the reactive behavior of the sediments. In particular, the availability of dissolved organic carbon determines whether the streambed acts as a net sink or source of nitrate. This study represents a step towards a better understanding of the complex interactions between hydrodynamical and biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

15,15,"Fauvet, G",2001 ,"Influence of benthic and interstitial processes on nutrient changes along a regulated reach of a large river (Rhone River, France)",HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Benthic and hyporheic (i.e. the water-saturated interstitial zone beneath river bed-sediments) processes together modify particulate and dissolved nutrient fluxes in streams, but the relative importance of these processes remains unstudied in large rivers. Changes in material and nutrient fluxes (total suspended matter, biodegradable and refractory dissolved organic carbon, and nitrate) were monitored along a reach with a regulated discharge (a by-passed section downstream of a dam). Mass balance diagrams highlight a contrasting functioning between upstream and downstream parts of this sector of the Rhone River (Pierre-Benite sector, France). At the upstream location close to the water input, characterized by partially clogged sediments and large lentic zones, decrease in total suspended matter (TSM) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) fluxes resulted from high rates of benthic processes (i.e. sedimentation, respiration and mineralisation). At the downstream location, characterized by strong vertical water exchanges in a large riffle, nutrient changes resulted from the combination of processes that took place at the surface of the stream bed and during water percolation through riffle sediments. Physical benthic processes (scouring of periphyton, erosion and resuspension of sediment due to higher surface velocity) lead to an increase of TSM and DOC fluxes. Within the riffle, decomposition and mineralisation of organic matter in the first meter of the infiltration zone, and physical entrapment of RDOC, make the riffle as a sink for DOC and a source of nitrate. The significant contribution of the riffle to the self-purification capacities of this large river reach shows the relevance of including interstitial compartment in self-purification studies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000169330700012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bbenthic%2Band%2Binterstitial%2Bprocesses%2Bon%2Bnutrient%2Bchanges%2Balong%2Ba%2Bregulated%2Breach%2Bof%2Ba%2Blarge%2Briver%2B%2528Rhone%2BRiver%252C%2BFrance%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DG%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DFauvet%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1017540306550%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D131%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1-3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D121-131%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D121%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D445%26rft.au%3DFauvet%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DClaret%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1023/A:1017540306550,"river,hyporheic zone,sediment,self-purification,dissolved organic carbon,nitrate,bacteria","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,HYPORHEIC ZONE,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,STREAMBED SEDIMENT,WATER EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER,RETENTION,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS,METABOLISM",,"Univ Savoie, GRETI, F-73376 Le Bourget Du Lac, France"

Terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs) that are used in respiration of organic C in anoxic environments may have a strong effect on nutrient dynamics and water chemistry. Concentrations of oxidized and reduced forms of terminal electron accepters (dissolved O-2, NO3-, Fe2+, SO42-, and CH4) were measured in networks of vertically nested wells installed beneath the surface stream and in the near-stream aquifer of a headwater catchment. Tracer addition experiments were conducted in surface and groundwater environments of a Ist-order montane stream to characterize hydrologic fluxes between the stream and aquifer, and to quantify ecosystem retention of terminal electron accepters (NO3- and SO42-) in the GW-SW ecotone. Sulfate retention was evident in both hyporheic and groundwater environments. Distribution of important redox sensitive solutes varied predictably with changing hydrologic residence time of water in the GW-SW ecotone. Results suggest a strong hydrologic control of TEAPs and ecosystem retention of biologically important solutes in the GW-SW ecotone related to characteristics of GW-SW mixing and residence time of water in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000166307900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTerminal%2Belectron%2Baccepting%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Bthe%2Balluvial%2Bsediments%2Bof%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DJA%26rft.auinit%3DJA%26rft.aulast%3DMorrice%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468119%26rft.epage%3D608%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D593-608%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D593%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DMorrice%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DDahm%252C%2BCN%26rft.au%3DCampana%252C%2BME&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1468119,"stream ecosystems,alluvial sediments,hyporheic zone,TEAPs,retention,hydrology","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,SULFATE REDUCTION,SURFACE-WATER,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,METHANE PRODUCTION,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,NUTRIENT DYNAMICS,RIPARIAN FOREST",,"US EPA, Midcontinent Ecol Div, 6201 Congdon Blvd, Duluth, MN 55804 USA"
17,17,"Fisher, SG",Jan-feb 1998 ,Material spiraling in stream corridors: A telescoping ecosystem model,ECOSYSTEMS,"Stream ecosystems consist of several subsystems that are spatially distributed concentrically, analogous to the elements of a simple telescope. Subsystems include the central surface stream, vertically and laterally arrayed saturated sediments (hyporheic and parafluvial zones), and the most distal element, the riparian zone. These zones are hydrologically connected; thus water and its dissolved and suspended load move through all of these subsystems as it flows downstream. In any given subsystem, chemical transformations result in a change in the quantity of materials in transport. Processing length is the length of subsystem required to ""process"" an amount of substrate equal to advective input. Long processing lengths reflect low rates of material cycling. Processing length provides the length dimension of each cylindrical element of the telescope and is specific to subsystem (for example, the surface stream), substrate (for instance, nitrate), and process (denitrification, for example). Disturbance causes processing length to increase. Processing length decreases during succession following disturbance. The whole stream-corridor ecosystem consists of several nested cylindrical elements that extend and retract, much as would a telescope, in response to disturbance regime. This telescoping ecosystem model (TEM) can improve understanding of material retention in running water systems; that is, their ""nutrient filtration"" capacity. We hypothesize that disturbance by flooding alters this capacity in proportion to both intensity of disturbance and to the relative effect of disturbance on each subsystem. We would expect more distal subsystems (for example, the riparian zone) to show the highest resistance to floods. fn contrast, we predict that postflood recovery of functions such as material processing (that is, resilience) will be highest in central elements and decrease laterally. Resistance and resilience of subsystems are thus both inversely correlated and spatially separated. We further hypothesize that cross-linkages between adjacent subsystems will enhance resilience of the system as a whole. Whole-ecosystem retention transformation, and transport are thus viewed as a function of subsystem extent, lateral and vertical linkage, and disturbance regime.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000075676100003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMaterial%2Bspiraling%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bcorridors%253A%2BA%2Btelescoping%2Becosystem%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DSG%26rft.auinit%3DSG%26rft.aulast%3DFisher%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs100219900003%26rft.epage%3D34%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1432-9840%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D19-34%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D19%26rft.stitle%3DECOSYSTEMS%26rft.volume%3D1%26rft.au%3DFisher%252C%2BSG%26rft.au%3DGrimm%252C%2BNB%26rft.au%3DJones%252C%2BJB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=ECOSYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s100219900003,"stream,riparian,disturbance,nutrients,hyporheic,hydrology,telescoping ecosystem","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,DESERT STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS,NUTRIENT RETENTION,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,HEADWATER STREAMS,NITRATE REMOVAL,RIPARIAN FOREST,SURFACE-WATER",,"Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA"

This study investigated the main behavior of biogeochemical NH4+ from groundwater to surface water in a hyporheic zone (HZ) sediment from a reservoir. The experiments were conducted using synthetic groundwater to investigate ammonium transformation. The results indicated that ammonium concentration decreased, apparently resulting from the influence of microbial oxidation and ion exchange with Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+. However, all the ammonium in the sediment was oxidized, then the adsorbed NH4+ became bioavailable by being released back when NH4+ concentration decreased in the aqueous phase. The results showed NH4+ behavior in a HZ where the aerobic and anaerobic environments frequently exchange, with different hydrological conditions controlled by a strong coupling between microbial activities, geochemistry, hydrology, and ion exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000787521000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1237%26rft.atitle%3DReactive%2BTransport%2Bof%2BNH4%252B%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BGround%2BWater%2Bto%2Bthe%2BSurface%2BWater%26rft.aufirst%3DAilan%26rft.auinit%3DAL%26rft.aulast%3DYan%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw14081237%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DYan%252C%2BAL%26rft.au%3DGuo%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w14081237,"hyporheic zone,ammonium (NH4+) pollution,biological oxidation,ion exchange","DISSIMILATORY NITRATE REDUCTION,ANAEROBIC AMMONIUM OXIDATION,NITROGEN,DENITRIFICATION,NITRIFICATION,EXCHANGE,REMOVAL,ANAMMOX",,"Zhejiang Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Key Lab Technol Rural Water Management Zhejiang P, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China"

Despite its importance in freshwater ecosystems in terms of services provided, the hyporheic zone has often been overlooked as a research topic. This study assessed the impact of cattle access to headwater streams on hyporheic zone parameters. The results indicate increases in levels of interstitial, hyporheic fine sediment downstream of cattle access points and the potential for this to negatively affect hyporheic invertebrate communities. Invertebrate community composition changes were observed at some sites with changes representing a shift to less diverse communities of smaller bodied invertebrates.

The most notable finding is hybrid exchange, a synergistic hybrid of transaction and gift-giving.Practical implications - The authors recommend that both streamers and streaming platforms acknowledge and accommodate both transactional and relational tipping motivations. The authors also recommend platforms to recruit skillful streamers with high emotional intelligence to better convert perfunctory tippers into tippers who tip more generously.Originality/value - The result of hybrid exchange suggests going beyond the traditional commodity vs gift dichotomy to examine the potential market-gift complementary in a single exchange in the sharing economy.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000812249200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUnraveling%2Bhybrid%2Bexchange%253A%2Bvirtual%2Btipping%2Bon%2Blive-streaming%2Bplatforms%26rft.aufirst%3DJohn%2BPeikang%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DSun%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1108%252FINTR-10-2020-0597%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1066-2243%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNET%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINTERNET%2BRES%26rft.au%3DSun%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DFernandez%252C%2BKV%26rft.au%3DFrethey-Bentham%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=INTERNET+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1108/INTR-10-2020-0597,"Hybrid exchange,Virtual tipping,Live-streaming,Motivations","GIFT,MOTIVATIONS,MARKET",,"Univ Auckland, Dept Mkt, Auckland Business Sch, Auckland, New Zealand"
21,21,"Crenshaw, CL",Mar 2002 ,Effects of coarse particulate organic matter on fungal biomass and invertebrate density in the subsurface of a headwater stream,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Links between groundwater invertebrates and their potential food resources were examined using biofilm development on fine wood. Little is known about biofilm development and organic matter content of lateral subsurface (i.e., parafluvial) environments and hyporheic habitats (upwelling and downwelling zones). Eighteen experimental baskets containing river rocks were paired by treatment in which I basket was supplemented with wood (six 7.2 cm X 12 cm strips of oak wood veneer). Nine pairs of baskets were buried 12 to 15 cm below the surface in Gallina Creek, a 1st-order mountain stream in northern New Mexico in late summer 1997. Three pairs were buried beneath the stream bank (i.e., parafluvial zone) and 6 pairs were buried in the hyporheic zone. Baskets were distributed along upwelling and downwelling readies to assess the potential hydrologic influence of subsurface-surface exchange. Open baskets of wood veneer were placed on the streambed surface to compare fungal biomass on the surface with the subsurface. Wood in both hyporheic and parafluvial baskets was colonized by fungi, but fungal biomass was significantly greater on wood in surface water than in hyporheic and parafluvial zones. In addition, fungal biomass on hyporheic wood was significantly greater than on parafluvial wood. A similar pattern (i.e., surface > hyporheic > parafluvial) was observed for dissolved oxygen.

22,22,"Boulton, A",2004 ,Of spates and species: responses by interstitial water mites to simulated spates in a subtropical Australian river,EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY,"The 'hyporheic refuge hypothesis' predicts that the hyporheic zone, the saturated sediments below and alongside rivers and streams, is a refuge from the scouring effects of spates for many aquatic invertebrates including water mites. We tested this hypothesis in two lateral gravel bars and two riffles in a subtropical Australian river by collecting water mites from the hyporheic zone at two depths (10 and 50 cm) at two 'pre-flood' sampling times before experimentally diverting water through the sites for 14 h to simulate a spate. Taxon richness of mites washigh (46 taxa) and dominated by the Prostigmata, with nearly half the species being new to science. Oribatids were also common at the four sites. Samples were collected twice during each 'spate', and again soon after flow was returned to normal. The experimental spate induced changes in the strength and even direction of subsurface-surface water exchange; however, these changes seldom persisted after the experiment, nor after a subsequent natural spate. The hyporheic refuge hypothesis was not supported by our water mite data. Neither during nor shortly after the experimental spates did we find more epigean (surface-dwelling) water mites in downwelling zones where surface streamwater enters the hyporheic zone, demonstrating that these mites were not using the hyporheic zone as a refuge at these locations. There was also no evidence for a 'wash out' effect, because hyporheic mitedensities did not significantly decline late in the spate. Our data indicate that floods of the low magnitude simulated in this study apparently do not pose a lasting disturbance for hypogean water mites. The fact that the same response was found at four sites indicates that the hyporheic refuge hypothesis may not always be an appropriate explanation for rapid post-flood recolonisation. Possibly, the use of the hyporheic zone as a refuge from floods may be dictated by the strength of the disturbance and substrate composition and stability.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000229039700011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOf%2Bspates%2Band%2Bspecies%253A%2Bresponses%2Bby%2Binterstitial%2Bwater%2Bmites%2Bto%2Bsimulated%2Bspates%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsubtropical%2BAustralian%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FB%253AAPPA.0000044445.30246.b2%26rft.eissn%3D1572-9702%26rft.epage%3D169%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-8162%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DEXPERIMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BACAROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D149-169%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D149%26rft.stitle%3DEXP%2BAPPL%2BACAROL%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DProctor%252C%2BH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=EXPERIMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+ACAROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1023/B:APPA.0000044445.30246.b2,"Australia,flow refuges,hyporheic refuge hypothesis,interstitial water mites,spates,subtropical river","HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,LOTIC DISTURBANCE,INVERTEBRATES,STREAM,ECOLOGY,SURFACE",,"Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia"

The model includes three-dimensional (3D) large-eddy simulation of water above the sediment-water interface, 3D advective and diffusive transport within sediments by both physical and biological processes (bioturbation and bioirrigation), and biogeochemical processes within the sediment including reduction of electron acceptors, acid-base reactions, and metal sorption and precipitation. The model was applied to explore the influence of overlying water chemistry and sediment chemical, physical and biological processes on metal release from sediments. Overlying water conditions (pH, salinity, oxygen saturation) may vary diurnally due to tidal cycling and control the short-term release of metals, while over longer times (months), metals are controlled by long-term averages of sediment convective processes (groundwater upwelling, hyporheic exchange and bioirrigation). Metal release is significantly enhanced when there is bioroughness and bioirrigation due to local oxidation of surficial sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000780818700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030790%26rft.atitle%3DRoles%2Bof%2BTidal%2BCycling%252C%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Band%2BBioirrigation%2Bon%2BMetal%2BRelease%2BFrom%2BEstuary%2BSediments%26rft.aufirst%3DY.%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030790%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DReible%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DHussain%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR030790,"large eddy simulation,sediment water interface,bioturbation,metal release,tidal cycling,hyporheic exchange","CHIRONOMUS-PLUMOSUS,NEREIS-VIRENS,BIOTURBATION,TRANSPORT,SALINITY,BURROWS,IMPACT,MODEL,FATE,PH",,"Texas Tech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA"

We describe the properties and scaling patterns of river network topology across the contiguous United States: how lake/reservoir abundance, median lake/reservoir size, and median lake/reservoir spacing change with river size. Typically, lake/reservoir abundance decreases, median lake/reservoir size increases, but median lake/reservoir spacing is uniform across river size. There is a characteristic lake/reservoir size of 0.01-0.05km(2) and a characteristic lake/reservoir spacing of 1-5km that shifts to 27-61km in larger rivers. Climate explains more of the variance in river network topology than both glacial history and constructed reservoirs. Our results provide conceptual models for building river network topologies to assess how lake/reservoir abundance, size, and spacing effect the transport, storage, and cycling of water, materials, and organisms across networks.Plain Language Summary Rivers and lakes/reservoirs serve different hydrologic, ecologic, and economic roles and are often studied as separate systems. Yet there are many lakes/reservoirs connected to rivers and this connectivity has profound impacts on sediment storage and transport, biogeochemical cycles, and aquatic habitat in both rivers and lakes/reservoirs. Defining the topology of river networks is critical for understanding these processes across entire networks of connected rivers and lakes/reservoirs. We defined river network topology by scaling the abundance, size, and spacing of lakes/reservoirs with river size and identified broadscale controls of network topology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000462612900029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BAbundance%252C%2BSize%252C%2Band%2BSpacing%2Bof%2BLakes%2Band%2BReservoirs%2BConnected%2Bto%2BRiver%2BNetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DJR%26rft.aulast%3DGardner%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018GL080841%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D2601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2592-2601%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2592%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DGardner%252C%2BJR%26rft.au%3DPavelsky%252C%2BTM%26rft.au%3DDoyle%252C%2BMW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018GL080841,"river network,lakes,scaling,connectivity,stream order,topology","UNITED-STATES,DRAINAGE NETWORKS,SCALING LAWS,SEDIMENT,EVOLUTION,GEOMETRY,REMOVAL,CLIMATE,SYSTEMS,STORAGE",,"Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA"
25,25,"Maazouzi, C",Jan 2013 ,Nutrient dynamics in river bed sediments: effects of hydrological disturbances using experimental flow manipulations,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,"River sediments play a crucial role in the storage and transformation of organic matter (OM). Nutrient dynamics are controlled by the interaction of several key parameters, i.e. river discharge, channel geometry and vertical exchanges of water (upwelling vs. downwelling zones). The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of channel forms and discharge variation on nutrient spiralling in the hyporheic zone (HZ) of streams.Four experimental flow manipulations (EFM) were carried out at two reaches with different channel forms (straight vs. sinuous) in an oligotrophic subtropical river in Australia. Flow manipulation consisted of reducing the river width with a temporary dam, diverting and concentrating the main water flux on two different geomorphological units (riffle vs. gravel bar), in order to simulate flooding conditions. Hyporheic waters were analysed for their physicochemical characteristics and nutrient (nitrates + nitrites = NO (x) and soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP]) and OM contents at two depths (10 and 50 cm) within the bed sediments, both upstream and downstream of the geomorphological units.The physicochemical parameters clearly demonstrated the existence of hyporheic flow paths, characterized by the alternation of downwelling and upwelling areas, with more consistent gradients in gravel bars than in riffles. The HZ acted as source for NO (x) and SRP, but this role varied between geomorphological units and reaches. The effect of EFM differed between sampling points, irrespective of the type of geomorphological unit. In gravel bars, a flush out during high discharge was observed for NO (x) , SRP and particulate organic matter (POM) at the sinuous channel, whereas storage and removal were recorded at the straight channel for SRP and NO (x) , respectively. At the riffle of the sinuous channel, very fine POM accumulated, while removal was noticed for POM. In contrast, at the riffle of the straight channel, SRP accumulated in the HZ and NO (x) was removed out of the HZ.Nutrient dynamics in the HZ and the response to flow increases were not governed by the geomorphological unit type. Other parameters that determine water residence time in the sediments, such as local heterogeneity in sediment characteristics (grain size, porosity and hydraulic conductivity), channel sinuosity, reach slope and the size and form of the gravel bar, may be more significant explanatory variables for understanding OM and nutrient dynamics in the HZ. This study emphasizes the need for caution in making generalisations about the role of river sediment in nutrient storage and the impact of floods on nutrient dynamics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000313411500020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNutrient%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Briver%2Bbed%2Bsediments%253A%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bhydrological%2Bdisturbances%2Busing%2Bexperimental%2Bflow%2Bmanipulations%26rft.aufirst%3DChafik%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DMaazouzi%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11368-012-0622-x%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7480%26rft.epage%3D219%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1439-0108%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BSOILS%2BAND%2BSEDIMENTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D207-219%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D207%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BSOIL%2BSEDIMENT%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DMaazouzi%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DClaret%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+SOILS+AND+SEDIMENTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11368-012-0622-x,"Flow manipulation,Geomorphology,Hyporheic zone,Nitrogen,Organic matter,Phosphorus,Subtropical river","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,HYPORHEIC ZONE,WATER EXCHANGE,INTERSTITIAL HABITATS,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,MATTER STORAGE,GARONNE RIVER,RURAL STREAMS,DESERT STREAM,GRAVEL BAR",,"Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, ENTPE, LEHNA,UMR5023, 6 Rue Raphael Dubois, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"

Here, we study the impact of streambed morphology, stream-reactive solute loads and their diel oscillations on the DO benthic uptake rate (BUR) due to hyporheic processes. Our model solves the hyporheic flow field and the solute transport equations analytically, within a Lagrangian framework, considering advection, longitudinal diffusion and reactions modeled as first order kinetics. The application of the model to DO field measurements over a gravel bar-pool sequence shows a good match with measured DO concentrations with an overall agreement of 58% and a kappa index of 0.46. We apply the model to investigate the effects of daily constant and sinusoidally time varying stream BOD, DO and Nr loads and of the morphodynamic parameters on BUR. Our modeling results show that BUR varies as a function of bedform size and of nutrient loads and that the hyporheic zone may consume up to 0.06% of the stream DO at the pool-riffle bedform scale. Daily oscillations of stream BOD and DO loads have small effects on BUR, but may have an important influence on local hyporheic processes and organisms' distribution.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000353384400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBenthic%2BUptake%2BRate%2Bdue%2Bto%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%253A%2BThe%2BEffects%2Bof%2BStreambed%2BMorphology%2Bfor%2BConstant%2Band%2BSinusoidally%2BVarying%2BNutrient%2BLoads%26rft.aufirst%3DDaniele%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DTonina%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw7020398%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.epage%3D419%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D398-419%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D398%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DMarzadri%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBellin%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w7020398,,"BED FORMS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,WATER INTERFACE,OXYGEN-UPTAKE,ZONE,MODEL,TRANSPORT,CHANNEL,RIVER,DENITRIFICATION",,"Univ Idaho, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, 322 E Front St,Suite 322, Boise, ID 83702 USA"

Due to the curvilinear nature of the flow pattern in the vicinity of the stream, with numerical procedures, very fine grids would have to be used in order to secure accurate results. This is a waste of numerical efforts when the solution can be obtained analytically. Here, we show that the local analytical procedure for the determination of the stream-aquifer flow exchange (SAFE) coefficient can be integrated within a regional numerical groundwater model through an original boundary condition. This is a very practical result. With this new approach, it is quite simple to calculate accurately the discharges on the two sides of the river when the heads are different. This is an important capability for example when wells are present near a river. The results show also that the extent of penetration of the stream is a factor in the estimation of the discharges. At the very least, the results can be used to choose a grid size that will yield correct estimates within an a priori selected acceptable level of accuracy.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000343933400022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAnalytical%2Bsolutions%2Bfor%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bflow%2Bexchange%2Bunder%2Bvarying%2Bhead%2Basymmetry%2Band%2Briver%2Bpenetration%253A%2BComparison%2Bto%2Bnumerical%2Bsolutions%2Band%2Buse%2Bin%2Bregional%2Bgroundwater%2Bmodels%26rft.aufirst%3DCinzia%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DMiracapillo%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR015456%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7444%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7430-7444%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7430%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DMiracapillo%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DMorel-Seytoux%252C%2BHJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014WR015456,"stream-aquifer interaction,analytical solution,numerical comparison","DEPLETION,STAGE,RECHARGE",,"Hydroprose Int Consulting, Santa Rosa, CA 94027 USA"
28,28,"Baker, MA",Sep 1999 ,Acetate retention and metabolism in the hyporheic zone of a mountain stream,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"An in situ acetate injection was used to determine the influence of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) availability on microbial respiration in the hyporheic zone of a headwater stream. We added bromide as a conservative tracer and acetate as an organic substrate to the hyporheic zone of Rio Calaveras, New Mexico, via an injection well. Tracer was observed in four of eight capture wells. Three of the four wells showed increases in bromide without concurrent increases in acetate concentration, suggesting 100% acetate retention. One well had 38% acetate retention. Pore velocity and acetate retention were negatively correlated, suggesting hydrologic control of acetate retention. Acetate did not significantly sorb to the sandy hyporheic sediments at this site, indicating biological consumption of acetate. Acetate addition stimulated total CO2 production along monitored flowpaths and led to changes in solutes associated with microbial terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs). Dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, and sulfate significantly decreased, and ferrous iron and methane significantly increased compared to background concentrations in most wells. These results support the hypothesis that microbial respiration in the hyporheic zone is limited by labile DOC availability. Furthermore, we have shown that a suite of metabolic processes, from aerobic respiration to methanogenesis, cooccur and that anaerobic processes dominate heterotrophic metabolism in the hyporheic zone of Rio Calaveras.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000082201900016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAcetate%2Bretention%2Band%2Bmetabolism%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bmountain%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DMA%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DBaker%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.1999.44.6.1530%26rft.epage%3D1539%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1530-1539%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1530%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DBaker%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DDahm%252C%2BCN%26rft.au%3DValett%252C%2BHM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.1999.44.6.1530,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,SURFACE-WATER,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,HEADWATER STREAMS,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,SEDIMENTS,RESPIRATION,OXIDATION",,"Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, 5305 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA"
29,29,"Gartner, JD",May 15 2012 ,Time and depth scales of fine sediment delivery into gravel stream beds: Constraints from fallout radionuclides on fine sediment residence time and delivery,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Particles of fine sediment can clog interstitial pore spaces of coarser grained sediment in river beds and thereby impede the exchange of water, dissolved constituents, and particulate matter with consequent ecological impacts. The extent to which fine sediment reduces connectivity between the stream bed and overlying channel is a function, in part, of sediment residence time. Short residence times imply frequent exchange of matter and reduced impact of fine sediment on stream bed habitat, while long residence times indicate that with respect to fine sediment delivery, the stream bed is more isolated from the overlying channel. Here we present a novel technique to quantify the residence time of river bed sediment at various depths over annual and decadal timescales using the fallout radionuclides (FRNs) Be-7 (t(1/2) = 53 days) and (210)pb(ex) (t(1/2) = 22.3 years). We placed mesh cylinders filled with Be-7-free sediment into a stream bed to quantify the capture of Be-7-tagged particles in the absence of scour and fill. We also took cores to the depth of refusal in alluvial sediment in unregulated and regulated rivers in Vermont and New Hampshire. Sampled watershed areas ranged from 29 to 410 km(2), and core depths ranged from 19 to 77 cm. The Pb-210(ex) activity profiles of cores show that bed sediment is exchanged to the depth of refusal at decadal timescales. In contrast, 7Be activity profiles indicate that fine sediment infiltrating into the bed had residence times ranging from 4 to >300 days in unregulated rivers. Cores from a regulated river are notably different-subsurface sediment residence times were always longer than in unregulated rivers at comparable depths, likely owing to restriction of bed mobilization and clogging of bed material by fine sediment. These results suggest that filtration can be an important component of bed material delivery to stream beds, but filtration does not deliver material as deeply into the bed as scour and fill. We find that fallout radionuclides provide direct measurements of time and depth scales of active exchange of particulate matter, which are key controls on hyporheic function. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

30,30,"Xiao, Y",Aug 2022 ,Numerical simulation of overbank hyporheic transport and biogeochemical reactions in a compound channel,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Transverse hyporheic transport and biogeochemical reactions in a compound channel remain poorly understood. As floodplains are submerged, solutes in the surface water enter the hyporheic zone of the compound channel and react with the solutes upwelling below the floodplain. Aerobic respiration (AR) and denitrification (DN) processes in the hyporheic zone of the compound channel still need to be clarified. In this paper, a 3D hydrodynamic model coupled to a 2D groundwater flow and biogeochemical model was applied to investigate such processes. The model results were verified using laboratory experimental measurements. The effects of bank slope angle, ambient groundwater flow, and ambient groundwater solute concentration on aerobic and anaerobic biogeochemical processes were studied. The denitrification zone was found below the interface between the main channel and the floodplain. The lower bank slope angle favours nitrogen removal. Small losing groundwater discharges promote aerobic respiration and denitrification reactions. As the ambient groundwater oxygen concentration rises, O-2 consumption increases while N removal decreases. As the NO3 concentration in ambient groundwater increases, NO3 consumption increases and proportionally NO3 consumption decreases. These findings not only provide a better understanding of biogeochemical reactions in a compound channel but can also be applied to river restoration to efficiently remove nitrate by modifying bank slope angles.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000846908600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14670%26rft.atitle%3DNumerical%2Bsimulation%2Bof%2Boverbank%2Bhyporheic%2Btransport%2Band%2Bbiogeochemical%2Breactions%2Bin%2Ba%2Bcompound%2Bchannel%26rft.aufirst%3DYang%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DXiao%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14670%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DXiao%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14670,"aerobic respiration,biogeochemical reactions,compound channel,denitrification,transverse hyporheic transport","IN-STREAM STRUCTURES,COHERENT STRUCTURES,NITRATE REMOVAL,FLOW,DENITRIFICATION,RIVER,EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER,FLOODPLAINS,EFFICIENCY",,"1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
31,31,"Michel, C",Mar 2014 ,Artificial steps mitigate the effect of fine sediment on the survival of brown trout embryos in a heavily modified river,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Understanding the factors that determine successful salmonid embryo incubation in the many structurally modified river systems of the Northern Hemisphere is crucial for maintaining healthy salmonid populations. In this context, the joint impact of fine sediment accumulation together with anthropogenic river modifications on salmonid embryo survival has been rarely investigated. We investigated brown trout embryo survival to hatch (STH) together with ten physicochemical, hydraulic and morphological parameters in artificial brown trout redds in a heavily modified stream (i.e. channelized, artificial log steps) in central Switzerland. We were interested to understand whether (i) STH is more sensitive to the timing and duration of low oxygen rather than a mean oxygen concentration, (ii) STH was negatively affected by increased fine sediment deposition decreasing redd gravel permeability, (iii) higher water levels, causing fine sediment resuspension, benefit STH, (iv) STH was negatively affected by organic content in the redds and especially (v) hydraulic gradients related to redd scale bed-form and/or the artificial step structure benefit embryo STH, and hence could mitigate the negative impact of fine sediment and/or organic content. Up to 50%, brown trout embryos survived with interstitial oxygen exceeding 3mg L-1. Embryos endured up to 6days 1mg L-1 but were more sensitive to oxygen depletion close to hatch. Therefore, timing and duration of low oxygen were important for embryo STH, and hence, oxygen dynamics need to be considered when assessing in redd conditions for salmonid STH. Partial least squares regression identified the horizontal hydraulic gradient, Fredle index, distance to artificial log steps upstream and amount of accumulated fine sediment as influential predictors for embryo STH. The water level above the redd and total organic carbon content in the redd were not influential. Among the identified influential predictors, 70.9% of the variation in STH could be explained by a logistic regression model containing redd distance to the next upstream step (26.4%, P=0.004), Fredle index (27.2%, P=0.003) and horizontal hydraulic gradient (10.1%, P=0.04). In the logistic regression, the amount of accumulated fine sediment (P=0.75), field seasons (P=0.93) and field sites (P=0.66) was non-significant. In summary, brown trout STH was sensitive to redd gravel permeability, which was measured as Fredle index and affected by fine sediment deposition. At the same time, hydraulic gradients related to artificial log steps, which enhanced hyporheic exchange, benefited embryo STH, and hence mitigated fine sediment impact. This result can be probably transferred to other surface water-dominated river systems with good hyporheic water quality. To what extent it can be transferred to river systems with other hydraulic boundary conditions remains to be evaluated. Altogether, our results clearly indicate that the impact of fine sediment on salmonid incubation success needs to be understood in the hydrological and morphological context of the particular river system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000330779600010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DArtificial%2Bsteps%2Bmitigate%2Bthe%2Beffect%2Bof%2Bfine%2Bsediment%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bsurvival%2Bof%2Bbrown%2Btrout%2Bembryos%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheavily%2Bmodified%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DMichel%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffwb.12284%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D556%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D544-556%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D544%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D59%26rft.au%3DMichel%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DWildhaber%252C%2BYS%26rft.au%3DBurkhardt-Holm%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/fwb.12284,"artificial steps,hydromorphology,hyporheic exchange,river restoration,salmonid fish","TO-FRY SURVIVAL,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,RAINBOW-TROUT,OXYGEN AVAILABILITY,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN,SALMO-TRUTTA,HYDRAULIC GRADIENTS,SPAWNING GRAVELS,WATER EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER",,"Univ Basel, Dept Environm Sci, Programme MGU Man Soc Environm, Vesalgasse 1, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland"
32,32,"Weitbrecht, V",Feb 2008 ,Experiments on mass exchange between groin fields and main stream in rivers,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE,"Laboratory experiments are presented that model the exchange processes between a river and dead-water zones created by groin fields. The measurement methods include particle image velocimetry (PIV) at the water surface to capture the dynamics of the flow field as well as planar concentration analysis (PCA) to determine the depth integrated mass fluxes of dissolved tracer. Idealized groins with variable length-to-width ratios and inclination angles relative to the flow direction are investigated. Two-dimensional large coherent structures (2DLCS) are found in the mixing layer between the groin field and the river, and these flow structures control the majority of mixing with the main stream. The PIV data allow quantification of the turbulence intensity distribution in these structures throughout the groin field and mixing region. The PCA data provide measurements of the exchange rate between the groin field and the main stream. Both methods give comparable measures of the entrainment coefficient for the exchange flow. The entrainment coefficient is found to depend on the groin field hydraulic radius (a measure of the average size of 2DLCS in the mixing layer) and the water depth (a parameter controlling the stability of the shallow water flow). These data provide a link between the exchange parameter in groin field dead zones and the river properties that can be used to efficiently develop river alarm models to predict contaminant transport without requiring a large amount of field dye studies for calibration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000252600000005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExperiments%2Bon%2Bmass%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Bgroin%2Bfields%2Band%2Bmain%2Bstream%2Bin%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DVolker%26rft.auinit%3DV%26rft.aulast%3DWeitbrecht%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9429%25282008%2529134%253A2%2528173%2529%26rft.epage%3D183%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9429%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BENGINEERING-ASCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D173-183%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D173%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BENG-ASCE%26rft.volume%3D134%26rft.au%3DWeitbrecht%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DSocolofsky%252C%2BSA%26rft.au%3DJirka%252C%2BGH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+ENGINEERING-ASCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2008)134:2(173),,"LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION COEFFICIENT,GROYNE FIELDS,NATURAL STREAMS,FLOW,MODEL,TRANSPORT,STORAGE",,"Univ Karlsruhe, Inst Hydromech, Environm Fluid Mech Grp, Kaiserstr 12, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany"
33,33,"Jin, GQ",Apr 2015 ,Prolonged river water pollution due to variable-density flow and solute transport in the riverbed,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A laboratory experiment and numerical modeling were used to examine effects of density gradients on hyporheic flow and solute transport under the condition of a solute pulse input to a river with regular bed forms. Relatively low-density gradients due to an initial salt pulse concentration of 1.55 kg m(-3) applied in the experiment were found to modulate significantly the pore-water flow and solute transport in the riverbed. Such density gradients increased downward flow and solute transport in the riverbed by factors up to 1.6. This resulted in a 12.2% increase in the total salt transfer from the water column to the riverbed over the salt pulse period. As the solute pulse passed, the effect of the density gradients reversed, slowing down the release of the solute back to the river water by a factor of 3.7. Numerical modeling indicated that these density effects intensified as salt concentrations in the water column increased. Simulations further showed that the density gradients might even lead to unstable flow and result in solute fingers in the bed of large bed forms. The slow release of solute from the bed back to the river led to a long tail of solute concentration in the river water. These findings have implications for assessment of impact of pollution events on river systems, in particular, long-term effects on both the river water and riverbed due to the hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000354733500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DProlonged%2Briver%2Bwater%2Bpollution%2Bdue%2Bto%2Bvariable-density%2Bflow%2Band%2Bsolute%2Btransport%2Bin%2Bthe%2Briverbed%26rft.aufirst%3DGuangqiu%26rft.auinit%3DGQ%26rft.aulast%3DJin%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR016369%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1915%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1898-1915%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1898%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DTang%252C%2BHW%26rft.au%3DBarry%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014WR016369,"solute transport,river water quality,hyporheic exchange,low-density gradients,pollution incident,fingers,instability","TRANSIENT STORAGE,PETROCHEMICAL PLANT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,MOUNTAIN STREAM,RESIDENCE TIME,SONGHUA RIVER,EXCHANGE,EXPLOSION,INTERFACE,RELEASE",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
34,34,"Bartsch, S",Feb 13 2014 ,River-aquifer exchange fluxes under monsoonal climate conditions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"An important prerequisite to better understand the transport of nutrients and contaminants across the river-aquifer interface and possible implications for biogeochemical transformations is to accurately characterize and asses the exchange fluxes. In this study we investigate how monsoonal precipitation events and the resulting variability in river discharge affect the dynamics of river-aquifer exchange and the corresponding flux rates. We evaluate potential impacts of the investigated exchange fluxes on local water quality. Hydraulic gradients along a piezometer transect were monitored at a river reach in a small catchment in South Korea, where the hydrologic dynamics are driven by the East-Asian Monsoon. We used heat as a tracer to constrain river-aquifer exchange fluxes in a two-dimensional flow and heat transport model implemented in the numerical code HydroGeoSphere, which was calibrated to the measured temperature and total head data. To elucidate potential effects of river-aquifer exchange dynamics on biogeochemical transformations at the river-aquifer interface, river water and groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate (NO3) and dissolved oxygen saturation (DOsat). Our results illustrate highly variable hydrologic conditions during the monsoon season characterized by temporal and spatial variability in river-aquifer exchange fluxes with frequent flow reversals (changes between gaining and losing conditions). Intense monsoonal precipitation events and the associated rapid changes in river stage are the dominant driver for the observed riverbed flow reversals. The chemical data suggest that the flow reversals, when river water high in DOC is pushed into the nitrate-rich groundwater below the stream and subsequently returns to the stream may facilitate and enhance the natural attenuation of nitrate in the shallow groundwater.

36,36,"Mueller, M",Mar 2013 ,The effects of stream substratum texture on interstitial conditions and bacterial biofilms: Methodological strategies,LIMNOLOGICA,"Hyporheic substrates play a key role in aquatic ecosystems, and increasing loads of fine sediment are considered one of the major threats to stream ecosystems. Knowledge concerning the interaction of stream substratum properties with habitat quality and microbial community structure is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the functionality of the hyporheic zone. To date, there is a lack of optimal field sampling methods for hyporheic microbial communities in streams. We systematically tested the effects of defined substratum textures on the physicochemical properties of interstitial water and on bacterial communities utilising T-RFLP fingerprinting. We also tested the representativeness of different methodological approaches of investigating bacterial diversity comparing sampling of substratum, interstitial water, and exposed coupons made of granite, carbonate and glass. The temporal development of physicochemical habitat characteristics in the interstitial zone, especially of fish-toxic nitrogen compounds and oxygen supply, significantly depended on substratum texture and was strongly correlated with bacterial community composition. Multivariate analyses of bacterial community data indicated strong differences in community composition between direct (substratum samples) and indirect (interstitial water samples, coupons) sampling strategies. Substratum samples yielded highest richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the most pronounced temporal dynamics of bacterial community composition, Consequently, this technique appears most representative for assessing bacterial community structure and diversity in hyporheic habitats. The observed couplings between substratum texture, physicochemical habitat conditions and bacterial community structure expand current knowledge of previously described negative effects of fine sediments on taxa from higher levels of biological organization.

We present a mobile-immobile model that incorporates transport as well as immobilization and remobilization of contaminant microbes and other fine particles during baseflow and stormflow. During baseflow conditions, hyporheic exchange flow causes particles to accumulate in streambed sediments. Remobilization of stored particles from streambed sediments occurs slowly during baseflow via hyporheic exchange flow, while remobilization is vastly increased during stormflow. Model predictions are compared to observations over a range of artificial and natural flood events in the dairy contaminated Topehaehae Stream, New Zealand. The model outputs closely matched timing and magnitude of E. coli and turbidity observations through multiple high-flow events. By accounting for both state-of-flow and hyporheic exchange processes, the model provides a valuable framework for predicting particle and contaminant microbe behavior in streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000783764300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021GL096514%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2BContaminant%2BMicrobes%2Bin%2BRivers%2BDuring%2BBoth%2BBaseflow%2Band%2BStormflow%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DDrummond%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021GL096514%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DAquino%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021GL096514,"hyporheic,immobilization,remobilization,contaminant microbes,particle tracking model,mobile immobile model","FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA,ESCHERICHIA-COLI CONCENTRATIONS,HIGH-FLOW EVENTS,SOURCE TRACKING,MASS-TRANSFER,STREAM,TRANSPORT,SEDIMENT,WATER,DYNAMICS",,"Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England"

The coupling aims to further incorporate the interactions occurring in alluvial rivers and thus enhance the prediction of the fine sediment fluxes, especially during high stream power events. Based on a predictive rule for the control factor m that only involves water depth, velocity and bedform constitutive texture, the novel method is confronted to observations collected in one of the most strongly dynamic alluvial river namely the Lower Yellow River. Comparisons between time series of measured and computed concentrations illustrate that during high velocity events the main dynamics of the sediment transport is correctly reproduced. The main advantage of the present approach is to supply consistent time evolutions of sediment concentrations without making use of any detailed shear information.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000316807700006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Bestimation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Benergy%2Bslope%2Band%2Bassociated%2Bsand-silt%2Btransport%2Bduring%2Bhigh%2Bstream%2Bpower%2Bevents%2Bin%2Balluvial%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DN.%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DHuybrechts%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252FS1001-6279%252813%252960018-9%26rft.epage%3D65%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1001-6279%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BSEDIMENT%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D58-65%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D58%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BSEDIMENT%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DHuybrechts%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BYF%26rft.au%3DVerbanck%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+SEDIMENT+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/S1001-6279(13)60018-9,"Energy slope,Steam power,Alluvial river,Non-cohesive sediment,Silt flushing","SEDIMENT TRANSPORT,FLOW RESISTANCE,TURBULENCE,DYNAMICS",,"Ctr Rech Royallieu, UMR CNRS 7337, LHN Joint Res Unit UTC CETMEF, Roberval Lab, BP 20529, F-60206 Compiegne, France"

The extent of trace metal uptake was calculated by mass balance measurements made directly within the hyporheic zone. A conservative salute tracer injected into the stream was used to quantify hydrologic exchange with the stream and groundwater. Fractional reactive uptake of dissolved metals entering the hyporheic zone was determined at 29 sites and averaged 52 +/- 25, 27 +/- 19, and 36 +/-: 24% for Co, Ni, and Zn, compared with Mn uptake of 22 +/- 19%. First-order rate constants (lambda(h)) Of metal uptake in the hyporheic zone were determined at seven sites using the exchange rate of water derived from tracer arrival in the streambed. Reaction-time constants (1/lambda(h)) averaged 0.41, 0.84, and 0.38 h for Co, Ni, and Zn, respectively, and 1.3 h for Mn. In laboratory experiments with streambed sediments, metal uptake increased with preexisting Mn oxide concentration, supporting our interpretation that Mn oxides in the hyporheic zone enhance trace metal uptake. Reach-scale mass-balance calculations that include groundwater metal inputs indicated that decreases in metal loads ranged from 12 to 68% over the 7-km perennial reach depending on the metal. The decreases in metal loads are attributed to uptake of trace metals by Mn oxides in the hyporheic zone that is enhanced because of ongoing Mn oxide formation. Analysis of dissolved-metal streambed profiles and conservative solute tracers provide a valuable tool for quantifying metal uptake or release in the hyporheic zone of contaminated streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000086233800020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DReactive%2Buptake%2Bof%2Btrace%2Bmetals%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bmining-contaminated%2Bstream%252C%2BPinal%2BCreek%252C%2BArizona%26rft.aufirst%3DCC%26rft.auinit%3DCC%26rft.aulast%3DFuller%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes990714d%26rft.epage%3D1155%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1150-1155%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1150%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DFuller%252C%2BCC%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es990714d,,"MINE DRAINAGE,MANGANESE,TRANSPORT,AQUIFER,WATER,COPRECIPITATION,GROUNDWATER,STABILITY,BEHAVIOR,OXIDES",,"US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Park, CA 94025 USA"
40,40,"Kerr, PC",Aug 8 2013 ,The significance of model structure in one-dimensional stream solute transport models with multiple transient storage zones - competing vs. nested arrangements,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Transient storage models are commonly used to simulate solute transport in streams to characterize hydrologic controls on biogeochemical cycling. Recently, 2-storage zone (2-SZ) models have been developed to represent in-channel surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) separately to overcome the limitations of single storage zone (1-SZ) models. To advance biogeochemical models, we seek to separate the effects of these storage zones on solute fate and cycling in streams. Here we compare and contrast the application and interpretations from two model structures that include STS and HTS storage: a competing model structure, where both zones are connected to the stream at the same location and the stream interacts with the STS and HTS separately, and a nested model structure, where STS is an intermediary between the stream and HTS. We adapt common residence time metrics used to compare single transient storage models for the competing and nested 2-SZ models. As a test case, we investigated the transient storage characteristics of a first-order stream in Pennsylvania, using 1-SZ, nested 2-SZ, and competing 2-SZ model configurations at several different flow conditions. While both 2-SZ models fit the observed STS and in-stream breakthrough curves well, calibrated model parameters and solute molecule travel paths differ, as evident by the faster exchange rate displayed by the nested model, and therefore so does the interpretation of associated transient storage metrics and its relationship with biogeochemical cycling processes. In addition, a study of hypothetical zone-specific reaction rates was very illustrative of the differences in discrimination characterized by each model structure, particularly for the case where reactions would predominantly occur in the STS (i.e. photochemical reactions), because of the compounding effects to the HTS for the nested 2-SZ; however, for the case where reactions would predominantly occur in the HTS, the influence of model structure was found to be relegated only to the HTS.

41,41,"Menichino, GT",Mar 2015 ,Abundance and dimensions of naturally occurring macropores along stream channels and the effects of artificially constructed large macropores on transient storage,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Macropores are connected void spaces in the subsurface and can act as preferential flow paths for groundwater transport, but their dimensions and distribution patterns have not been well characterized in stream banks and hyporheic sediments. We ran field surveys in 5 streams of varying size, bed slope, and watershed land use in the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern Virginia. Natural surface-connected macropores were nearly ubiquitous. Macropores in this region arise by a variety of mechanisms, including soil piping, tree root decay, erosion around hardened structures, macroinvertebrate burrows, and invertebrate burrows. Macropore openings were slightly wider than tall, with median cross-sectional widths and heights of 3.5 cm and 3.0 cm, respectively. The median and maximum macropore lengths to first bend were 15.0 cm and 120.5 cm into the bank, respectively. True (tortuous) macropore lengths probably are often greater, and methods to map macropores are needed. Median interspacing of macropores across all streams was 0.38 m, but mean interspacing was 1.12 m, indicating that macropores were clustered in space. Macropores were inundated at different times because of differences in their heights on the stream bank, channel geometry, and stream stage. HEC-RAS modeling of channel hydraulics indicated that only 1 to 32% of macropores were inundated by channel water at base flow, whereas up to 97% were inundated during the largest storms. We ran conservative-tracer injection experiments at base flow in a 30-m reach of a small tributary to 1 study stream. We calculated transient-storage parameters for 2 treatments: 1 without macropores and 1 with artificially created macropores. Our results suggest that constructed macropores weakly increased transient storage (channel:storage zone cross-sectional area [A(s)/A] by 15.0% and fraction of median travel time spent in the transient-storage zone [F-med] by 31.0%) and may affect surface-water-groundwater interactions. Many macropore openings were above typical baseflow water levels, so macropores may enhance bank storage, a possibility that bears further research.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000349995000011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAbundance%2Band%2Bdimensions%2Bof%2Bnaturally%2Boccurring%2Bmacropores%2Balong%2Bstream%2Bchannels%2Band%2Bthe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bartificially%2Bconstructed%2Blarge%2Bmacropores%2Bon%2Btransient%2Bstorage%26rft.aufirst%3DGarrett%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DGT%26rft.aulast%3DMenichino%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F679655%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D138%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D125-138%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D125%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DMenichino%252C%2BGT%26rft.au%3DScott%252C%2BDT%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/679655,"connected void spaces,hydraulic conductivity,field survey,hydroperiods,hyporheic exchange,transient storage","PREFERENTIAL FLOW PATHS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,SUBSURFACE FLOW,RIPARIAN ZONE,BANK STORAGE,BASE-FLOW,BED RIVER,WATER",,"Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
42,42,"Briggs, MA",May 30 2014 ,Residence time control on hot moments of net nitrate production and uptake in the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The retention capacity for biologically available nitrogen within streams can be influenced by dynamic hyporheic zone exchange, a process that may act as either a net source or net sink of dissolved nitrogen. Over 5 weeks, nine vertical profiles of streambed chemistry (NO3- and NH4+) were collected above two beaver dams along with continuous high-resolution vertical hyporheic flux data. The results indicate a non-linear relation of net NO3- production followed by net uptake in the hyporheic zone as a function of residence time. This Lagrangian-based relation is consistent through time and across varied morphology (bars, pools, glides) above the dams, even though biogeochemical and environmental factors varied. The empirical continuum between net NO3- production and uptake and residence time is useful for identifying two crucial residence time thresholds: the transition to anaerobic respiration, which corresponds to the time of peak net nitrate production, and the net sink threshold, which is defined by a net uptake in NO3- relative to streamwater. Short-term hyporheic residence time variability at specific locations creates hot moments of net production and uptake, enhancing NO3- production as residence times approach the anaerobic threshold, and changing zones of net NO3- production to uptake as residence times increase past the net sink threshold. The anaerobic and net sink thresholds for beaver-influenced streambed morphology occur at much shorter residence times (1.3 h and 2.3 h, respectively) compared to other documented hyporheic systems, and the net sink threshold compares favorably to the lower boundary of the anaerobic threshold determined for this system with the new oxygen Damkohler number. The consistency of the residence time threshold values of NO3- cycling in this study, despite environmental variability and disparate morphology, indicates that NO3- hot moment dynamics are primarily driven by changes in physical hydrology and associated residence times.

Using laboratory experiments and numerical modeling, we demonstrated that even small density variations can influence hyporheic flow in streambeds with periodic bed forms. The circulating pore water flow patterns in the bed were modified constantly as the solute front moved downward. Density-induced head gradients eventually overwhelmed the regional hydraulic gradient and drove the circulating flow below a hydraulic divide that would have existed without the density influence. The density-modified hyporheic flow provided a relatively fast solute transport mechanism and enhanced the overall mass exchange between the stream and bed. These results highlight the important role of weak, upward density gradients in modulating hyporheic flow. Citation: Jin, G., H. Tang, L. Li, and D. A.

44,44,"Jaeger, A",Jun 22 2021 ,Transformation of organic micropollutants along hyporheic flow in bedforms of river-simulating flumes,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Urban streams receive increasing loads of organic micropollutants from treated wastewaters. A comprehensive understanding of the in-stream fate of micropollutants is thus of high interest for water quality management. Bedforms induce pumping effects considerably contributing to whole stream hyporheic exchange and are hotspots of biogeochemical turnover processes. However, little is known about the transformation of micropollutants in such structures. In the present study, we set up recirculating flumes to examine the transformation of a set of micropollutants along single flowpaths in two triangular bedforms. We sampled porewater from four locations in the bedforms over 78 days and analysed the resulting concentration curves using the results of a hydrodynamic model in combination with a reactive transport model accounting for advection, dispersion, first-order removal and retardation. The four porewater sampling locations were positioned on individual flowpaths with median solute travel times ranging from 11.5 to 43.3 h as shown in a hydrodynamic model previously. Highest stability was estimated for hydrochlorothiazide on all flowpaths. Lowest detectable half-lives were estimated for sotalol (0.7 h) and sitagliptin (0.2 h) along the shortest flowpath. Also, venlafaxine, acesulfame, bezafibrate, irbesartan, valsartan, ibuprofen and naproxen displayed lower half-lives at shorter flowpaths in the first bedform. However, the behavior of many compounds in the second bedform deviated from expectations, where particularly transformation products, e.g. valsartan acid, showed high concentrations. Flowpath-specific behavior as observed for metformin or flume-specific behavior as observed for metoprolol acid, for instance, was attributed to potential small-scale or flume-scale heterogeneity of microbial community compositions, respectively. The results of the study indicate that the shallow hyporheic flow field and the small-scale heterogeneity of the microbial community are major controlling factors for the transformation of relevant micropollutants in river sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000667447800015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B13034%26rft.atitle%3DTransformation%2Bof%2Borganic%2Bmicropollutants%2Balong%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bin%2Bbedforms%2Bof%2Briver-simulating%2Bflumes%26rft.aufirst%3DAnna%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DJaeger%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41598-021-91519-2%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2045-2322%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENTIFIC%2BREPORTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BREP-UK%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DJaeger%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DPosselt%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=SCIENTIFIC+REPORTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1038/s41598-021-91519-2,,"ZONE,EXCHANGE,PRODUCTS,FATE,BIOTRANSFORMATION,ATTENUATION,ECOLOGY,PHARMACEUTICALS,DENITRIFICATION,IDENTIFICATION",,"Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecohydrol, Berlin, Germany"
45,45,"Ng, GHC",Feb 2020 ,Microbial and Reactive Transport Modeling Evidence for Hyporheic Flux-Driven Cryptic Sulfur Cycling and Anaerobic Methane Oxidation in a Sulfate-Impacted Wetland-Stream System,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"This study reexamines the common expectations that in freshwater systems, sulfur plays a minor role in carbon cycling, and aerobic processes dominate methane oxidation. In anoxic sediments of a sulfate-impacted wetland-stream system in Minnesota (USA), a reactive transport model calibrated to geochemical observations predicted sulfate reduction to be the major terminal electron accepting process, and it showed that anaerobic oxidation of methane predominantly coupled with sulfate reduction attenuated methane concentrations near the sediment-water interface. Consistent with model results, 16S rRNA microbiome analysis revealed a high relative abundance of taxa capable of dissimilatory sulfate reduction. It further supported the conclusion that high simulated sulfate reduction rates could be maintained by a ""cryptic"" sulfur cycle coupled to iron and methane. Low relative abundance of known iron reducing bacteria raised the possibility of abiotic ferric iron (Fe) reduction driving sulfide reoxidation to intermediate-valence sulfur forms; widespread potential for microbially mediated disproportionation, oxidation, and reduction of sulfur intermediates provided mechanisms for completing redox cycles; and archaea comprising up to 25% of the microbial community could include consortia capable of anaerobic oxidation of methane. These biogeochemical processes were found to be controlled by hyporheic fluxes. Lower-magnitude fluxes in wetland compared to channel sediments created sharper geochemical gradients that generated greater heterogeneity in microbial distributions and reaction rates. Changes in upward flux caused fluctuations in sulfate concentrations that led to alternating simulations of methane production and transport. Our work supports the importance of hyporheic flux-driven iron-sulfur-methane cycling in sulfate-impacted wetlands and prompts further investigations under freshwater conditions.Key PointsReactive transport model and microbiome analysis quantify and describe hyporheic flux-driven Fe-S-CH 4 processes in sulfate-impacted wetlands Cryptic S cycling, coupled to Fe reduction and anaerobic CH 4 oxidation and involving S intermediates, may drive high sulfate reduction rates Dynamic hyporheic fluxes control spatial distributions of microbial compositions and spatiotemporal distributions of reaction ratesShow less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000534472900008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMicrobial%2Band%2BReactive%2BTransport%2BModeling%2BEvidence%2Bfor%2BHyporheic%2BFlux-Driven%2BCryptic%2BSulfur%2BCycling%2Band%2BAnaerobic%2BMethane%2BOxidation%2Bin%2Ba%2BSulfate-Impacted%2BWetland-Stream%2BSystem%26rft.aufirst%3DGene-Hua%2BCrystal%26rft.auinit%3DGHC%26rft.aulast%3DNg%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019JG005185%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D125%26rft.au%3DNg%252C%2BGHC%26rft.au%3DRosenfeld%252C%2BCE%26rft.au%3DJohnson%252C%2BNW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019JG005185,"hyporheic zone,wetlands,anaerobic methane oxidation,cryptic sulfur cycling,reactive transport modeling,16S rRNA microbiome analysis","RADIAL OXYGEN LOSS,FRESH-WATER,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,REDUCING BACTERIA,HYDROGEN-SULFIDE,MARINE SEDIMENT,HOT MOMENTS,REDUCTION,IRON,CARBON",,"Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA"
46,46,"Newcomer, ME",Mar 2018 ,Influence of Hydrological Perturbations and Riverbed Sediment Characteristics on Hyporheic Zone Respiration of CO2 and N-2,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Rivers in climatic zones characterized by dry and wet seasons often experience periodic transitions between losing and gaining conditions across the river-aquifer continuum. Infiltration shifts can stimulate hyporheic microbial biomass growth and cycling of riverine carbon and nitrogen leading to major exports of biogenic CO2 and N-2 to rivers. In this study, we develop and test a numerical model that simulates biological-physical feedback in the hyporheic zone. We used the model to explore different initial conditions in terms of dissolved organic carbon availability, sediment characteristics, and stochastic variability in aerobic and anaerobic conditions from water table fluctuations. Our results show that while highly losing rivers have greater hyporheic CO2 and N-2 production, gaining rivers allowed the greatest fraction of CO2 and N-2 production to return to the river. Hyporheic aerobic respiration and denitrification contributed 0.1-2g/m(2)/d of CO2 and 0.01-0.2g/m(2)/d of N-2; however, the suite of potential microbial behaviors varied greatly among sediment characteristics. We found that losing rivers that consistently lacked an exit pathway can store up to 100% of the entering C/N as subsurface biomass and dissolved gas. Our results demonstrate the importance of subsurface feedbacks whereby microbes and hydrology jointly control fate of C and N and are strongly linked to wet-season control of initial sediment conditions and hydrologic control of seepage direction. These results provide a new understanding of hydrobiological and sediment-based controls on hyporheic zone respiration, including a new explanation for the occurrence of anoxic microzones and large denitrification rates in gravelly riverbeds.Plain Language Summary River systems are important components of our landscape that help to degrade contaminants, support food webs, and transform organic matter. In this study, we developed and tested a model that could help reveal the role of the riverbed for these ecosystem services. We used the model to explore how different riverbed conditions eventually control the fate of carbon and nitrogen. Our results show that carbon and nitrogen transformations and the potential suite of microbial behaviors are dependent on the riverbed sediment structure and the water table conditions in the local groundwater system. The implications of this are that the riverbed sediments and the cumulative effect of water table conditions can control hyporheic processing. Under future river discharge conditions, assuming reduced river flows and siltation of riverbeds, reductions in total hyporheic processing may be observed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000430181200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2BHydrological%2BPerturbations%2Band%2BRiverbed%2BSediment%2BCharacteristics%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BRespiration%2Bof%2BCO2%2Band%2BN-2%26rft.aufirst%3DMichelle%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DME%26rft.aulast%3DNewcomer%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017JG004090%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D922%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D902-922%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D902%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D123%26rft.au%3DNewcomer%252C%2BME%26rft.au%3DHubbard%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DRubin%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017JG004090,"nutrient dynamics,hyporheic biogenic gas,water table fluctuations,dynamic permeability,losing rivers,Mediterranean climate","SATURATED POROUS-MEDIA,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,MICROBIAL-GROWTH,STREAMBED HETEROGENEITY,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,NITRATE ATTENUATION,DIEL FLUCTUATIONS,MISSISSIPPI RIVER,AQUIFER EXCHANGE",,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA"
47,47,"Min, LL",Feb 2020 ,Numerical Approaches for Estimating Daily River Leakage from Arid Ephemeral Streams,WATER,"Despite the significance of river leakage to riparian ecosystems in arid/semi-arid regions, a true understanding and the accurate quantification of the leakage processes of ephemeral rivers in these regions remain elusive. In this study, the patterns of river infiltration and the associated controlling factors in an approximately 150-km section of the Donghe River (lower Heihe River, China) were revealed using a combination of field investigations and modelling techniques. The results showed that from 21 April 2010 to 7 September 2012, river water leakage accounted for 33% of the total river runoff in the simulated segments. A sensitivity analysis showed that the simulated infiltration rates were most sensitive to the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and the maximum evapotranspiration (ET) rate. However, the river leakage rate, i.e., the ratio of the leakage volume to the total runoff volume, of a single runoff event relies heavily on the total runoff volume and river flow rate. In addition to the hydraulic parameters of riverbeds, the characteristics of ET parameters are equally important for quantifying the flux exchange between arid ephemeral streams and underlying aquifers. Coupled surface/groundwater models, which aim to estimate river leakage, should consider riparian zones because these areas play a dominant role in the formation of leakage from the river for recharging via ET. The results of this paper can be used as a reference for water resource planning and management in regulated river basins to help maintain riparian ecosystems in arid regions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000519846500190,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B499%26rft.atitle%3DNumerical%2BApproaches%2Bfor%2BEstimating%2BDaily%2BRiver%2BLeakage%2Bfrom%2BArid%2BEphemeral%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DLeilei%26rft.auinit%3DLL%26rft.aulast%3DMin%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12020499%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DMin%252C%2BLL%26rft.au%3DVasilevskiy%252C%2BPY%26rft.au%3DYu%252C%2BJJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w12020499,"river-aquifer interaction,numerical simulation,sensitivity analysis,MODFLOW,Heihe River","LOWER HEIHE RIVER,GROUNDWATER RECHARGE,SURFACE-WATER,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,EJINA BASIN,AQUIFER EXCHANGE,HVORSLEV FORMULA,DRIVING FORCES,INTERMITTENT,DYNAMICS",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, 11A,Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China"

To investigate the effect of hydrological exchange and biogeochemical processes on the fate of nutrients in surface water and HZs, a novel model, SWAT-MRMT-R, was developed coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model and the reaction module from a flow and reactive transport code (PFLOTRAN). SWAT-MRMT-R simulates concurrent nonlinear multicomponent biogeochemical reactions in both the channel water and its surrounding HZs, connecting the channel water and HZs through hyporheic exchanges using multirate mass transfer (MRMT) representation. Within the model, HZs are conceptualized as transient storage zones with distinguished exchange rates and residence times. The biogeochemical processes within HZs are different from those in the channel water. Hyporheic exchanges are modeled as multiple first-order mass transfers between the channel water and HZs. As a numerical example, SWAT-MRMT-R is applied to the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River, a large river in the United States, focusing on nitrate dynamics in the channel water. Major nitrate contaminants entering the Hanford Reach include those from the legacy waste, irrigation return flows (irrigation water that is not consumed by crops and runs off as point sources to the stream), and groundwater seepage resulting from irrigated agriculture. A two-step reaction sequence for denitrification and an aerobic respiration reaction is assumed to represent the biogeochemical transformations taking place within the HZs. The spatially variable hyporheic exchange rates and residence times in this example are estimated with the basin-scale Networks with EXchange and Subsurface Storage (NEXSS) model. Our simulation results show that (1), given a residence time distribution, how the exchange fluxes to HZs are approximated when using MRMT can significantly change the amount of nitrate consumption in HZs through denitrification and (2) source locations of nitrate have a different impact on surface water quality due to the spatially variable hyporheic exchanges.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000562027400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmultirate%2Bmass%2Btransfer%2Bmodel%2Bto%2Brepresent%2Bthe%2Binteraction%2Bof%2Bmulticomponent%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bprocesses%2Bbetween%2Bsurface%2Bwater%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%2B%2528SWAT-MRMT-R%2B1.0%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DYilin%26rft.auinit%3DYL%26rft.aulast%3DFang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fgmd-13-3553-2020%26rft.eissn%3D1991-9603%26rft.epage%3D3569%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1991-959X%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOSCIENTIFIC%2BMODEL%2BDEVELOPMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3553-3569%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3553%26rft.stitle%3DGEOSCI%2BMODEL%2BDEV%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DFang%252C%2BYL%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DGraham%252C%2BEB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD44i9lgwdqWD8GzT0QLeC&SrcJTitle=GEOSCIENTIFIC+MODEL+DEVELOPMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/gmd-13-3553-2020,,"GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAMS,FLOW,TIME,DENITRIFICATION,RETENTION,IMPACT,RIVERS",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA"
49,49,"Liu, MY",Apr 10 2021 ,Predicting the effective diffusivity across the sediment-water interface in rivers,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"Hyporheic exchange directly controls and regulates the transport of nutrients, heat, and organic matter across the sediment-water interface (SWI), thereby affecting the biochemical processes in rivers, which is critical for maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. The interface exchange is controlled by multiple processes, including physical, chemical, and biological processes, which can be modeled by the effective diffusion model using an effective diffusion coefficient, Deff, to quantify the hyporheic exchange rate. In this study, genetic programming (GP), a machine learning (ML) technique based on natural selection, is adopted to search for a robust relationship between the effective diffusion coefficient and surface flow conditions, bedforms, and sediment characteristics on the basis of published broad interfacial mass exchange flux measurements. By utilizing a data set covering a wide range of environmental condition parameters, the effective diffusion coefficient prediction models for the SWI with and without bedforms are developed. Results show that the dimensionless effective diffusion coefficient is not only related to the permeability Reynolds number, ReK, but also to the channel Reynolds number, Re. Compared with the flat bed, ReK has a greater effect on the hyporheic exchange when bedforms present at the SWI by affecting the pumping advection strength. The new Deff predictor with a relatively concise form exhibits considerable improvements with regard to prediction ability and is physically sound relative to the existing predictors.
