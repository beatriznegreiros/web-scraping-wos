0,0,"Aucour, AM",2013 ,Nitrogen patterns in subsurface waters of the Yzeron stream: effect of combined sewer overflows and subsurface-surface water mixing,WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"Urbanization subjects streams to increased nitrogen loads. Therefore studying nitrogen forms at the interface between urban stream and groundwater is important for water resource management. In this study we report results on water delta O-18 and nitrogen forms in subsurface waters of a stream (Yzeron, France). The sites studied were located upstream and downstream of combined sewer overflows (CSO) in a rural area and a periurban area, respectively. Water delta O-18 allowed us to follow the mixing of subsurface water with surface water. Dissolved organic nitrogen and organic carbon of fine sediment increased by 20-30% between rural and periurban subsurface waters in the cold season, under high flow. The highest nitrate levels were observed in rural subsurface waters in the cold season. The lowest nitrate levels were found in periurban subsurface waters in the warm season, under low flow. They corresponded to slow exchange of subsurface waters with channel water. Thus reduced exchange between surface and subsurface waters and organic-matter-rich input seemed to favor nitrate reduction in the downstream, periurban, subsurface waters impacted by CSO.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000328741000016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNitrogen%2Bpatterns%2Bin%2Bsubsurface%2Bwaters%2Bof%2Bthe%2BYzeron%2Bstream%253A%2Beffect%2Bof%2Bcombined%2Bsewer%2Boverflows%2Band%2Bsubsurface-surface%2Bwater%2Bmixing%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DAucour%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fwst.2013.531%26rft.eissn%3D1996-9732%26rft.epage%3D2637%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0273-1223%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2632-2637%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2632%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D68%26rft.au%3DAucour%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DBariac%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DZuddas%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=WATER+SCIENCE+AND+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/wst.2013.531,"CSO,hyporheic,nitrogen,oxygen isotopes,stream,subsurface water",URBANIZATION,,"Univ Lyon 1, LGL TPE, 2 Rue Raphael Dubois, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"
1,1,"Cai, ZY",Feb 5 2022 ,Spatiotemporal variability of water exchanges in the Pearl River Estuary by interactive multiscale currents,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"Driven by interactive multiscale motions, the water exchange between the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and coastal seas exhibits complex spatial structures and significant temporal variability. In this study, the exposure time (theta) was calculated using the adjoint method to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of water exchange and illustrate the substance movement pathway in the PRE and the adjacent shelf. Seasonal variations in water exchange are generally determined by subtidal motion in the estuary and adjacent shelf. In summer, the theta gradually increases from approximately 5 days near the lower estuary to 15 days in the upper estuary. In winter, associated with the weaker river discharge and prevailing northeasterly winds, the water exchange is suppressed and theta increases to approximately 35 days in the upper estuary. Owing to the surface/bottom subtidal offshore/ onshore transport in the water column, the theta of the bottom water increases by 10 days compared to the surface water. Outside the estuary, the seasonally reversing shelf current and onshore transport move the shelf substance back into the PRE. The theta to the southwest and northeast of the PRE is approximately 5 and 10 days in summer and winter, respectively. Temporally, the interplay between the periodic tidal motion and shelf current induces a significant intra-tidal variation of theta, predominantly in the middle estuary, where the water exchange is sensitive to the initial release time. The theta with the initial release time of high/low tide generally has shorter/longer values. The intra-tidal variation of theta is approximately three days and two weeks in summer and winter, respectively. The distinct three-dimensional structure and intra-tidal variability of water exchange illustrated in this study help to better utilize fluid motion that refreshes the water inside the estuary.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000789702900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B107730%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2Bvariability%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Bthe%2BPearl%2BRiver%2BEstuary%2Bby%2Binteractive%2Bmultiscale%2Bcurrents%26rft.aufirst%3DZhongya%26rft.auinit%3DZY%26rft.aulast%3DCai%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecss.2021.107730%26rft.eissn%3D1096-0015%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0272-7714%26rft.jtitle%3DESTUARINE%2BCOASTAL%2BAND%2BSHELF%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DESTUAR%2BCOAST%2BSHELF%2BS%26rft.volume%3D265%26rft.au%3DCai%252C%2BZY%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BGL%26rft.au%3DGan%252C%2BJP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=ESTUARINE+COASTAL+AND+SHELF+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107730,"Water exchange,Pearl River Estuary,Adjoint method,Intra-tidal variability,Interactive multiscale currents","RESIDENCE TIME,CIRCULATION,DYNAMICS,SYSTEM,SHELF,BAY,TRANSPORT,SURFACE,TIDES,WINDS",,"Univ Macau, State Key Lab Internet Things Smart City, Macau, Peoples R China"
2,2,"Mulholland, PJ",May 1997 ,Evidence that hyporheic zones increase heterotrophic metabolism and phosphorus uptake in forest streams,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"We used nondisruptive, whole-stream methods to measure hydraulic characteristics, ecosystem metabolism, and phosphorus cycling in the west fork of Walker Branch (WE), Tennessee and in Hugh White Creek (HWC), North Carolina. Although similar in many of their hydrological and chemical characteristics, transient storage zone volume in HWC was relatively large (similar to 1.5 times that of the flowing water zone), whereas transient storage zone volume in WE was small (similar to 0.1 times that of the flowing water zone). Both streams were highly heterotrophic (gross primary production:total respiration ratios <0.1), although respiration rate was similar to 2.4 times greater in HWC than in WE. Phosphorus uptake rate was similar to 2.6 times, greater in HWC than in WE, and P uptake length was 5 times longer in WE than in HWC. Analysis of P-33:H-3 ratio profiles from (PO4)-P-33 and (H2O)-H-3 injection experiments indicated that P uptake within the transient storage zone accounted for similar to 43% of the total P uptake in HWC but was negligible in WE, explaining, in part, the difference in total P uptake rate between these streams. The higher rate of P uptake in the surface zone, shorter P uptake length, and larger ratio of P uptake:respiration in HWC compared with WE suggest that the microbial community in HWC exerts a greater demand for and has a greater affinity for streamwater P presumably as a result of a greater supply of labile organic matter and/or lower nutrient levels in HWC.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1997XZ09100004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvidence%2Bthat%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%2Bincrease%2Bheterotrophic%2Bmetabolism%2Band%2Bphosphorus%2Buptake%2Bin%2Bforest%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DPJ%26rft.auinit%3DPJ%26rft.aulast%3DMulholland%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.1997.42.3.0443%26rft.epage%3D451%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D443-451%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D443%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DMulholland%252C%2BPJ%26rft.au%3DMarzolf%252C%2BER%26rft.au%3DHendricks%252C%2BSP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.1997.42.3.0443,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,TRANSIENT STORAGE MODEL,SURFACE-WATER,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,RIVER CONTINUUM,DESERT STREAM,EXCHANGE,SEDIMENTS,DYNAMICS",,"OAK RIDGE NATL LAB,DIV ENVIRONM SCI,POB 2008,OAK RIDGE,TN 37831, USA"
3,3,"Zeng, YJ",2016 ,"Ecohydrological effects of stream-aquifer water interaction: a case study of the Heihe River basin, northwestern China",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"A scheme describing the process of stream-aquifer interaction was combined with the land model CLM4.5 to investigate the effects of stream water conveyance over riparian banks on ecological and hydrological processes. Two groups of simulations for five typical river cross sections in the middle reaches of the arid-zone Heihe River basin were conducted. The comparisons between the simulated results and the measurements from water wells, the FLUXNET station, and remote sensing data showed good performance of the coupled model. The simulated riparian groundwater table at a propagation distance of less than 1 km followed the intra-annual fluctuation of the river water level, and the correlation was excellent (R-2 = 0.9) between the river water level and the groundwater table at the distance 60 m from the river. The correlation rapidly decreased as distance increased. In response to the variability of the water table, soil moisture at deep layers also followed the variation of river water level all year, while soil moisture at the surface layer was more sensitive to the river water level in the drought season than in the wet season. With increased soil moisture, the average gross primary productivity and respiration of riparian vegetation within 300 m from the river in a typical section of the river increased by approximately 0.03 and 0.02 mg Ca m(-2) s(-1), respectively, in the growing season. Consequently, the net ecosystem exchange increased by approximately 0.01 mg C m(-2) s(-1), and the evapotranspiration increased by approximately 3 mm day(-1). Furthermore, the length of the growing season of riparian vegetation also increased by 2-3 months due to the sustaining water recharge from the river. Overall, the stream-aquifer water interaction plays an essential role in the controlling of riparian hydrological and ecological processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000379419500013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEcohydrological%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bwater%2Binteraction%253A%2Ba%2Bcase%2Bstudy%2Bof%2Bthe%2BHeihe%2BRiver%2Bbasin%252C%2Bnorthwestern%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DYujin%26rft.auinit%3DYJ%26rft.aulast%3DZeng%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-20-2333-2016%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D2352%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2333-2352%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2333%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DZeng%252C%2BYJ%26rft.au%3DXie%252C%2BZH%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BYN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/hess-20-2333-2016,,"ANTHROPOGENIC GROUNDWATER EXPLOITATION,EARTH SYSTEM MODEL,NORTH-WEST CHINA,LOWER REACHES,CARBON-CYCLE,TARIM RIVER,SURFACE,CLIMATE,CLM4,CONVEYANCE",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China"
4,4,"Danner, EM",Dec 2012 ,River Temperature Forecasting: A Coupled-Modeling Framework for Management of River Habitat,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING,"Humans have substantially altered the thermal regimes of freshwater habitats worldwide, with significant environmental consequences. There is a critical need for a comprehensive modeling framework for forecasting the downstream impacts of two of the most common anthropogenic structures that alter river water temperatures: 1) dams that selectively release water from thermally stratified reservoirs, and 2) power generating stations and industrial plants that use river water for once-through cooling. These facilities change the thermal dynamics of the downstream waters through a complex interaction of water release volume and temperature and the subsequent exchange with the environment downstream. In order to stay within the downstream temperature limits imposed by regulatory agencies, managers must monitor not just release volumes and temperatures, but also need to be able to forecast the thermal impacts of their day-to-day operations on habitat which may be hundreds of kilometers downstream. Here we describe a coupled modeling framework that links mesoscale weather and ecological models to generate inputs for a physically-based water temperature model for monitoring and forecasting river temperatures downstream from these facilities at fine spatiotemporal scales. We provide an example of how this modeling framework is being applied to a water allocation decision support system (DSS) for the management of Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed salmon species in the Sacramento River in California.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000313009300020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiver%2BTemperature%2BForecasting%253A%2BA%2BCoupled-Modeling%2BFramework%2Bfor%2BManagement%2Bof%2BRiver%2BHabitat%26rft.aufirst%3DEric%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DEM%26rft.aulast%3DDanner%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FJSTARS.2012.2229968%26rft.eissn%3D2151-1535%26rft.epage%3D1760%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1939-1404%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BSELECTED%2BTOPICS%2BIN%2BAPPLIED%2BEARTH%2BOBSERVATIONS%2BAND%2BREMOTE%2BSENSING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1752-1760%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1752%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BJ-STARS%26rft.volume%3D5%26rft.au%3DDanner%252C%2BEM%26rft.au%3DMelton%252C%2BFS%26rft.au%3DNemani%252C%2BRR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=IEEE+JOURNAL+OF+SELECTED+TOPICS+IN+APPLIED+EARTH+OBSERVATIONS+AND+REMOTE+SENSING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2229968,"Forecasting,water resources","STREAM,DYNAMICS,SYSTEM",,"SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA"
5,5,"Hubbard, KA",Nov 15 2010 ,Evaluating nitrate uptake in a Rocky Mountain stream using labelled N-15 and ambient nitrate chemistry,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Background aqueous chemistry and N-15(nitrate) tracer injection methods were used to calculate in-stream nitrate uptake metrics at Red Canyon Creek, a third-order stream in the Rocky Mountains in the state of Wyoming, United States. 'Net' nitrate uptake lengths, which reflect both nitrate uptake and regeneration, and 'gross' nitrate uptake lengths, which exclude re-mineralization, were quantified separately from background nitrate chemistry and N-15 labelling tracer data, respectively. Gross nitrate uptake lengths, from tracer injections of N-15 labelled nitrate, ranged from 502 to 3140 m. Net nitrate uptake lengths, from background nitrate chemistry downstream of a point source, ranged from 1170 to 4330 m. Diurnal changes in uptake lengths suggest the importance of nitrate utilization by autotrophs in the stream and benthic zone. The differences between net and gross nitrate uptake lengths along lower reaches of Red Canyon Creek allowed us to estimate the nitrate regeneration rate, which was 0.056-0.080 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) during the day and 0.0062-0.0083 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at night. Spatial patterns of streambed pore water chemistry indicate those areas of the hyporheic zone where denitrification was likely occurring. Permanent log dams generated stronger redox gradients in the hyporheic zone than areas with transient beaver dams. By combining isotopically labelled nitrate additions, estimates of uptake from background aqueous nitrate chemistry and characterization of redox conditions in the hyporheic zone, we were able to determine the nitrate regeneration rate and the redox processes responsible for nitrogen cycling in the hyporheic zone.

6,6,"Du, XZ",Feb 2022 ,Investigating the impacts of glacier melt on stream temperature in a cold-region watershed: Coupling a glacier melt model with a hydrological model,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Stream temperature is a significant indicator for biodiversity and ecosystem health of stream ecosystem. The impacts of glacier melt processes on stream temperature, such as the cooling effect, have not been explicitly considered in process-based models, which limit model capability in simulating stream temperature in glacierized cold regions. We coupled a temperature index-based glacier melt model with the SWAT equilibrium temperature model to overcome this limitation. The coupled model was tested and applied in the upper Athabasca River basin in western Canada to simulate daily streamflow and stream temperature. It showed a good performance for stream temperature simulation with percent bias (PBIAS) less than +/- 5% and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) values greater than 0.85. The impact of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature simulation was investigated by turning the melt model on and off. The results illustrate that the coupled model accurately reproduces the impacts of glacier melt by simulating higher streamflow and lower stream temperature during the melt season. In particular, the progressive reduction in the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature from headwater to downstream was well represented. Finally, the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature under climate change was assessed by the scenario simulations. This analysis revealed that an increase in glacier melt runoff in the near future would alleviate the average and peak stream temperature increase during the melt season, while a decrease in glacier melt runoff in the distant future would ultimately aggravate the stream temperature increase. Therefore, the impact of glacier melt runoff should be explicitly considered in process-based models to accurately model stream temperature and predict future climate change impact on the thermal regime in the glacierized watersheds. The model coupling framework developed in this study could be a useful tool for simulating stream temperature in glacierized watersheds.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000752732200005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B127303%26rft.atitle%3DInvestigating%2Bthe%2Bimpacts%2Bof%2Bglacier%2Bmelt%2Bon%2Bstream%2Btemperature%2Bin%2Ba%2Bcold-region%2Bwatershed%253A%2BCoupling%2Ba%2Bglacier%2Bmelt%2Bmodel%2Bwith%2Ba%2Bhydrological%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DXinzhong%26rft.auinit%3DXZ%26rft.aulast%3DDu%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2021.127303%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D605%26rft.au%3DDu%252C%2BXZ%26rft.au%3DSilwal%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DFaramarzi%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127303,"Equilibrium temperature,Model coupling,SWAT model,Thermal regime","CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS,ATHABASCA RIVER-BASIN,SEA-LEVEL RISE,MASS-BALANCE,AIR-TEMPERATURE,QUALITY,RUNOFF,DYNAMICS,SYSTEM,ICE",,"Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Key Lab Nonpoint Source Pollut Control, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China"
7,7,"Ruehl, C",Oct 30 2006 ,Differential gauging and tracer tests resolve seepage fluxes in a strongly-losing stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The Pajaro River, central coastal California, consistently loses 0.2-0.4 m(3)/s of discharge along an 11.42-km experimental reach late in the water year, when discharge is <= 4.5 m(3)/s. Channel toss occurs throughout this reach, but is greatest in magnitude near the bottom of the reach. Water isotopic data and other observations suggest that channel loss results mainly from streambed seepage, as opposed to evapotranspiration. If it occurs throughout the year, the channel loss along this short stream reach could contribute 6-13 x 10(6) m(3) Of annual aquifer recharge, or similar to 20-40% of current sustainable basin yield. We performed a series of tracer injections along this reach to determine if hydrologic exchange occurs within this strongly-losing stream. We found that during periods of high channel loss, there were also comparable storage exchange fluxes and lateral inflow of tracer-free water. Within upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, storage exchange fluxes are about 10 times greater than lateral inflow. The former are associated with the movement of water between the main channel and surface or subsurface storage zones. In this system, it is likely that the tatter are primarily associated with spatially- or temporally-long subsurface flow paths within the shallow streambed, as opposed to inflow of ground water from deeper in the basin. Along both upper and lower parts of the experimental reach, lateral inflow tends to increase as channel discharge decreases. In contrast, storage exchange fluxes increase with decreasing discharge along the upper parts of the reach, but decrease with decreasing discharge along the Lower parts. Gauging and tracer test results suggest that subsurface storage exchange and loss may occur simultaneously, and that the lateral inflow of tracer-free water can be caused by long-scale subsurface flow as well as ground water making its first appearance in the channel.

8,8,"Tillman, DC",Jan 2003 ,Subsurface hydrology and degree of burial affect mass loss and invertebrate colonisation of leaves in a woodland stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. In deciduous forest streams, fallen leaves form a large component of the total organic matter budget, and many leaves become buried within stream sediments. We examined the processing of buried leaves as compared with those at the surface, and the influence of subsurface hydrology on processing rates.2. Leaf packs were secured on the streambed surface or buried 10 cm deep in upwelling and downwelling reaches of a second-order stream in Michigan, U. S. A. Mass loss and invertebrate colonisation were measured from October to February.3. Leaves buried in upwelling reaches lost mass more slowly ( exponential decay coefficient, k = -0.0097) than did leaves from the other treatments (buried downwelling:) 0.017; surface upwelling:) 0.022; surface downwelling: -0.021).4. Initially, more invertebrates colonised surface leaf packs than buried packs. During the remainder of the study, however, hydrology had a greater effect on invertebrate abundance than did burial, as more invertebrates were found in packs in downwelling reaches than in upwelling reaches.5. Local subsurface hydrology and degree of burial, factors rarely considered in studies of detritus processing, can significantly influence mass loss and invertebrate colonisation of fallen leaves in streams. Furthermore, because of slower processing, subsurface zones may function as organic matter reservoirs that gradually 'spiral' carbon to downstream subsurface and surface habitats.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000179693900009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSubsurface%2Bhydrology%2Band%2Bdegree%2Bof%2Bburial%2Baffect%2Bmass%2Bloss%2Band%2Binvertebrate%2Bcolonisation%2Bof%2Bleaves%2Bin%2Ba%2Bwoodland%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DDC%26rft.auinit%3DDC%26rft.aulast%3DTillman%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.2003.00976.x%26rft.epage%3D107%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D98-107%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D98%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DTillman%252C%2BDC%26rft.au%3DMoerke%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DLamberti%252C%2BGA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00976.x,"carbon cycling,detritus processing,hyporheic zone,meiofauna,Michigan stream","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,HEADWATER STREAMS,LEAF-LITTER,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,WATER CHEMISTRY,UPLAND STREAM,SURFACE-WATER,EXCHANGE",,"Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA"

We measure both the classification performance and resource consumption (runtime, memory, and power) of five usual stream classification algorithms, implemented in a consistent library, and applied to two real human activity datasets and three synthetic datasets. Regarding classification performance, the results show the overall superiority of the Hoeffding Tree, the Mondrian forest, and the Naive Bayes classifiers over the Feedforward Neural Network and the Micro Cluster Nearest Neighbor classifiers on four datasets out of six, including the real ones. In addition, the Hoeffding Tree and-to some extent-the Micro Cluster Nearest Neighbor, are the only classifiers that can recover from a concept drift. Overall, the three leading classifiers still perform substantially worse than an offline classifier on the real datasets. Regarding resource consumption, the Hoeffding Tree and the Mondrian forest are the most memory intensive and have the longest runtime; however, no difference in power consumption is found between classifiers. We conclude that stream learning for Human Activity Recognition on connected objects is challenged by two factors which could lead to interesting future work: a high memory consumption and low F1 scores overall.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000595049200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B6486%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BBenchmark%2Bof%2BData%2BStream%2BClassification%2Bfor%2BHuman%2BActivity%2BRecognition%2Bon%2BConnected%2BObjects%26rft.aufirst%3DMartin%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DKhannouz%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fs20226486%26rft.eissn%3D1424-8220%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D22%26rft.jtitle%3DSENSORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSENSORS-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DKhannouz%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DGlatard%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=SENSORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/s20226486,"application platform,data management and analytics,smart environment,data streams,classification,power,memory footprint,benchmark,human activity recognition,MCNN,Mondrian,Hoeffding tree",CONSUMPTION,,"Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada"

Microbes continuously immobilize and resuspend during downstream transport owing to a variety of processes including gravitational settling, attachment to in-stream structures such as submerged macrophytes, and hyporheic exchange and filtration within underlying sediments. We developed a stochastic model to describe these microbial transport and retention processes in rivers that also accounts for microbial inactivation. We used the model to assess the transport, retention, and inactivation stream and the underlying streambed sediments as measured from multitracer injection experiments. The results demonstrate that the combination of laboratory experiments on sediment cores, stream reach-scale tracer experiments, and multiscale stochastic modeling improves assessment of microbial transport in streams. This study (1) demonstrates new observations of microbial dynamics in streams with improved data quality than prior studies, (2) advances a stochastic modeling framework to include microbial inactivation processes that we observed to be important in these streams, and (3) synthesizes new and existing data to evaluate seasonal dynamics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000357840300041,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMicrobial%2BTransport%252C%2BRetention%252C%2Band%2BInactivation%2Bin%2BStreams%253A%2BA%2BCombined%2BExperimental%2Band%2BStochastic%2BModeling%2BApproach%26rft.aufirst%3DJennifer%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DDrummond%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.est.5b01414%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D7833%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7825-7833%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7825%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DDavies-Colley%252C%2BRJ%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/acs.est.5b01414,,"FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA,ESCHERICHIA-COLI,CRYPTOSPORIDIUM-PARVUM,SUNLIGHT INACTIVATION,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,CAMPYLOBACTER SPP.,DYNAMICS,BACTERIOPHAGES,CONTAMINATION,FILTRATION",,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"
12,12,"Armfield, JR",Mar 5 2019 ,Does Stream Water Composition at Sleepers River in Vermont Reflect Dynamic Changes in Soils During Recovery From Acidification?,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"Stream water pH and composition are widely used to monitor ongoing recovery from the deposition of strong anthropogenic acids in many forested headwater catchments in the northeastern United States. However, stream water composition is a function of highly complex and coupled processes, flowpaths, and variations in soil and bedrock composition. Spatial heterogeneity is especially pronounced in headwater catchments with steep topography, potentially limiting stream water composition as an indicator of changes in critical zone (CZ) dynamics during system recovery. To investigate the link between catchment characteristics, landscape position, and stream water composition we used long-term data (1991-2015) from the Sleepers River Research Watershed (SRRW) in northeastern Vermont. We investigated trends with time in stream water and trends with time, depth, and landscape position (upslope, midslope, and riparian zone) in groundwater (GW) and soil solution. We further determined soil elemental composition and mineralogy on archived (1996) and modern (2017) soil samples to assess changes in composition with time. SRRW is inherently well-buffered by calcite in bedrock and till, but soils had become acidified and are now recovering from acidification. Although base cations, especially Ca, decrease progressively with time in GW, riparian soils have become more enriched in Ca, due to a mixture of lateral and vertical transfers. At the same time stream water Ca fluxes increased over the past two decades, likely due to the leaching of (transient) legacy Ca from riparian zones and increased water fluxes. The stream water response therefore reflects the dynamic changes in soil chemistry, flow routing and water inputs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000467228300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B246%26rft.atitle%3DDoes%2BStream%2BWater%2BComposition%2Bat%2BSleepers%2BRiver%2Bin%2BVermont%2BReflect%2BDynamic%2BChanges%2Bin%2BSoils%2BDuring%2BRecovery%2BFrom%2BAcidification%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DJesse%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DJR%26rft.aulast%3DArmfield%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffeart.2018.00246%26rft.eissn%3D2296-6463%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BEARTH%2BSC-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D6%26rft.au%3DArmfield%252C%2BJR%26rft.au%3DPerdrial%252C%2BJN%26rft.au%3DRyan%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+EARTH+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/feart.2018.00246,"weathering,recovery,acid impact,Sleepers River,carbonate","ORGANIC-CARBON CONCENTRATIONS,LANDSCAPE POSITION,SURFACE-WATER,ACID PRECIPITATION,NORTH-AMERICA,MASS-BALANCE,TRENDS,FOREST,ZONE,CHEMISTRY",,"Univ Vermont, Dept Geol, Environm Biogeochem Lab, Burlington, VT 05405 USA"
13,13,"Worman, A",Oct 1998 ,Analytical solution and timescale for transport of reacting solutes in rivers and streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A number of biogeochemical reactions and lateral hydro:dynamic mixing affects the transport of solute elements in streams and rivers. The combination of the various mechanisms gives rise to an accumulation of the solute in temporary storage zones and a retardation of solute migration. A new model framework is proposed from which an analytical solution is derived describing the concentration as a function of distance along the stream, depth into storage zones, and time. The model includes the effects of sorption of solutes to suspended solids and bed sediments, a lateral exchange with the storage zones, first-order reactions, and dilution. The migration velocity is close to the advection velocity of the stream for a short travel distance, but it continuously decreases as the distance increases. The timescale of the process is linearly related to a modified Damkohler number; a dimensionless form of the lateral exchange coefficient. The analytical solution has been verified for two tracer experiments with both a sorbing and a nonreactive tracer and the Cr transport in the Vistula River, Poland. The lateral diffusion coefficient can be tentatively evaluated from the transport of Chernobyl Ca in several European rivers as a special case of the interpretative model.

Currently, tracer techniques couple STS and HTS effects on stream nutrient cycling; however, STS resides in localized areas of the surface stream and HTS resides in the hyporheic zone. These contrasting environments result in different storage and exchange mechanisms with the surface stream, which can yield contrasting results when comparing transient storage effects among morphologically diverse streams. We propose a fluid mechanics approach to quantitatively separate STS from HTS that involves classifying and studying different types of STS. As a starting point, a classification scheme is needed. This paper introduces a classification scheme that categorizes different STS in riverine systems based on their flow structure. Eight STS types are identified and some are subcategorized based on characteristic mean flow structure: (1) lateral cavities (emergent and submerged); (2) protruding in-channel flow obstructions (backward-and forward-facing step); (3) isolated in-channel flow obstructions (emergent and submerged); (4) cascades and riffles; (5) aquatic vegetation (emergent and submerged); (6) pools (vertically submerged cavity, closed cavity, and recirculating reservoir); (7) meander bends; and (8) confluence of streams. The long-term goal is to use the classification scheme presented to develop predictive mean residence times for different STS using field-measurable hydromorphic parameters and obtain an effective STS mean residence time. The effective STS mean residence time can then be deconvolved from the transient storage residence time distribution (measured from a tracer test) to obtain an estimate of HTS mean residence time.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000322376000026,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bfluid-mechanics%2Bbased%2Bclassification%2Bscheme%2Bfor%2Bsurface%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bin%2Briverine%2Benvironments%253A%2Bquantitatively%2Bseparating%2Bsurface%2Bfrom%2Bhyporheic%2Btransient%2Bstorage%26rft.aufirst%3DT.%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DTR%26rft.aulast%3DJackson%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-17-2747-2013%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D2779%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2747-2779%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2747%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DJackson%252C%2BTR%26rft.au%3DHaggerty%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DApte%252C%2BSV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/hess-17-2747-2013,,"BACKWARD-FACING STEP,LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION,OPEN-CHANNEL FLOW,VELOCITY-REVERSAL HYPOTHESIS,RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,POOL-RIFFLE SEQUENCES,MOUNTAIN STREAM,TURBULENT-FLOW,SECONDARY FLOW",,"Oregon State Univ, Water Resources Engn Program, 104 CEOAS Admin Bldg, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA"
15,15,"Bravo, JM",May 2012 ,Coupled Hydrologic-Hydraulic Modeling of the Upper Paraguay River Basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"This paper presents a detailed modeling of rainfall-runoff processes and flow routing along a complex large-scale region, the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB), encompassing a drainage area of approximately 600; 000 km(2), which extends over Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Within the UPRB lies the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland, with extraordinary biodiversity and great ecologic value, but which currently is threatened by anthropogenic activities. A conceptual model was applied with two main components: (1) simulation of the basin and part of the Paraguay River tributaries by means of the distributed large-scale hydrological model MGB-IPH using simpler flow routing methods; and (2) simulation of the main drainage network, approximately 4,800 km of river reaches, with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Despite the data scarcity, complexity, and the intricate river drainage network of the region, the coupled model was able to represent the hydrological regime of the basin. Comparisons between observed and calculated hydrographs showed a good model skill in representing the flow regime of the upper Paraguay River and its tributaries, highlighting its value as a tool for understanding and predicting the system behavior. The proposed modeling of the hydrological processes of the UPRB, with a detail never presented before, provides a valuable tool for understanding ecosystem functioning and assessing its resilience to anthropogenic pressure, climate change, and climate variability.

16,16,"Bustillos, S",Dec 10 2020 ,Implementation of Ion Exchange Processes for Carbon Dioxide Mineralization Using Industrial Waste Streams,FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH,"Sequestration of CO2 within stable mineral carbonates (e.g., CaCO3) represents an attractive emission reduction strategy because it offers a leakage-free alternative to geological storage of CO2 in an environmentally benign form. However, the pH of aqueous streams equilibrated with gaseous streams containing CO2 (pH < 4) are typically lower than that which is required for carbonate precipitation (pH > 8). Traditionally, alkalinity is provided by a stoichiometric reagent (e.g., NaOH) which renders these processes environmentally hazardous and economically unfeasible. This work investigates the use of regenerable ion-exchange materials to induce alkalinity in CO2-saturated aqueous solutions such that the pH shift required for mineralization occurs without the need for stoichiometric reagents. Na+-H+ exchange isotherms (at [H+] = 10(-8)-10(-1) M) and rates were measured for 13X and 4A zeolites and TP-207 and TP-260 organic exchange resins in batch equilibrium and fixed-bed exchange experiments, respectively. At solutions equilibrated with CO2 at 1.0 atm (pH = 3.9), H+ exchange capacities for the materials were similar (1.7-2.4 mmol H+/g material) and resulted in pH increases from 3.9 to greater than 8.0. Multi-component mixtures using Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations (at 10(-3)-10(-1) M) in CO2-saturated water were used to probe competitive ion exchange. The presence of divalent cations in solution inhibited H+ exchange, reducing capacities to as low as 0.2 mmol H+/g for both resins and zeolites. Dynamic H+ exchange capacities in fixed-bed ion exchange columns were similar to equilibrium values for resins (similar to 1.5 mmol/g) and zeolites (similar to 0.8 mmol/g) using inlet solutions that were equilibrated with gaseous streams of CO2 at 1.0 atm. However, exchange kinetics were limited by intraparticle diffusion as indicated by the increased rate parameters with increasing inlet flow rates (20-160 cm(3) min(-1)). Experimental calcite precipitation from mixing the alkaline CO32--rich water solution obtained from the ion-exchange column with a simulated liquid waste stream solution achieved thermodynamic maximum yields. The results from these studies indicate that ion exchange processes can be used as an alternative to the addition of stoichiometric bases to induce alkalinity for the precipitation of CaCO3, thereby opening a pathway toward sustainable and economic mineralization processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000601260200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B610392%26rft.atitle%3DImplementation%2Bof%2BIon%2BExchange%2BProcesses%2Bfor%2BCarbon%2BDioxide%2BMineralization%2BUsing%2BIndustrial%2BWaste%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DSteven%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DBustillos%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffenrg.2020.610392%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2296-598X%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BENERGY%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BENERGY%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DBustillos%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DAlturki%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSimonetti%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+ENERGY+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/fenrg.2020.610392,"carbon dioxde,mineralization,sustainable manufacturing,calcium carbonate,ion exchange","FIXED-BED COLUMN,POSTCOMBUSTION CO2 CAPTURE,AQUEOUS-SOLUTION,PROTON ADSORPTION,CALCIUM-CARBONATE,REMOVAL,DESIGN,WATER,REGENERATION,BIOSORPTION",,"Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA"

We consider distributed solute input over an entire catchment and investigate the resulting stream solute breakthrough, subject to the possible solute spreading mechanisms: (1) variable groundwater advection and solute mass transfer between mobile and immobile groundwater zones and (2) in-stream advection, mixing, and solute mass transfer between stream water and hyporheic zone. Among these mechanisms we show that fractal solute spreading over a wide timescale range is, for realistic parameter values, obtained in the stream only for the condition combination of both variable solute advection and solute mass transfer in the groundwater, with mean groundwater advection to mass transfer rate ratio that falls within a certain value range and with only a small fraction of solute input mass following fast overland and/or storm soil water flow to the stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000220442300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW03511%26rft.atitle%3DSolute%2Btransport%2Bthrough%2Bthe%2Bintegrated%2Bgroundwater-stream%2Bsystem%2Bof%2Ba%2Bcatchment%26rft.aufirst%3DGA%26rft.auinit%3DGA%26rft.aulast%3DLindgren%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2003WR002765%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DLindgren%252C%2BGA%26rft.au%3DDestouni%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DMiller%252C%2BAV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2003WR002765,"groundwater transport,mass transfer processes,residence time distributions,stream transport,watershed","STOCHASTIC-CONVECTIVE TRANSPORT,HETEROGENEOUS POROUS-MEDIA,TRAVEL-TIME STATISTICS,MASS-TRANSFER,REACTIVE TRANSPORT,NONLINEAR REACTION,PREFERENTIAL FLOW,DESORPTION RATES,SCALE DISPERSION,SORPTIVE SOLUTE",,"Royal Inst Technol, Dept Land & Water Resources Engn, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden"
18,18,"Khamis, K",Jul 15 2015 ,Heat exchange processes and thermal dynamics of a glacier-fed alpine stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Glacier-fed river thermal regimes vary markedly in space and time; however, knowledge is limited on the fundamental processes controlling alpine stream temperature dynamics. To address the research gap, this study quantified heat exchanges at the water surface and bed of the Taillon glacier-fed stream, French Pyrenees. Hydro-meteorological observations were recorded at 15-min intervals across two summer melt seasons (2010 and 2011), and energy balance components were measured or estimated based on site-specific data. Averaged over both seasons, net radiation was the largest heat source (similar to 80% of total flux); sensible heat (similar to 13%) and friction (similar to 3%) were also sources, while heat exchange across the channel-streambed interface was negligible (<1%). Latent heat displayed distinct interannual variability and contributed 5% in 2010 compared with 0.03% in 2011. At the sub-seasonal scale, latent heat shifted from source to sink, possibly linked to the retreating valley snowline that changed temperature and humidity gradients. These findings represent the first, multiyear study of the heat exchange processes operating in a glacier-fed stream, providing fundamental process understanding; the research highlights the direct control antecedent (winter) conditions that have on energy exchange and stream temperature during summer months. In particular, the timing and volume of snowfall/snowmelt can drive thermal dynamics by the following: (1) altering the length of the stream network exposed to the atmosphere and (2) controlling the volume and timing of cold water advection downstream. Finally, this study highlights the need to develop long-term hydro-meteorological monitoring stations to improve the understanding of these highly dynamic, climatically sensitive systems.

19,19,"Lam, NSN",Aug 2018 ,"Understanding the Mississippi River Delta as a Coupled Natural-Human System: Research Methods, Challenges, and Prospects",WATER,"A pressing question facing the Mississippi River Delta (MRD), like many deltaic communities around the world, is: Will the system be sustainable in the future given the threats of sea level rise, land loss, natural disasters, and depleting natural resources? An integrated coastal modeling framework that incorporates both the natural and human components of these communities, and their interactions with both pulse and press stressors, is needed to help improve our understanding of coastal resilience. However, studying the coastal communities using a coupled natural-human system (CNH) approach is difficult. This paper presents a CNH modeling framework to analyze coastal resilience. We first describe such a CNH modeling framework through a case study of the Lower Mississippi River Delta in coastal Louisiana, USA. Persistent land loss and associated population decrease in the study region, a result of interplays between human and natural factors, are a serious threat to the sustainability of the region. Then, the paper describes the methods and findings of three studies on how community resilience of the MRD system is measured, how land loss is modeled using an artificial neural network-cellular automata approach, and how a system dynamic modeling approach is used to simulate population change in the region. The paper concludes by highlighting lessons learned from these studies and suggesting the path forward for analysis of coupled natural-human systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000448462700088,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1054%26rft.atitle%3DUnderstanding%2Bthe%2BMississippi%2BRiver%2BDelta%2Bas%2Ba%2BCoupled%2BNatural-Human%2BSystem%253A%2BResearch%2BMethods%252C%2BChallenges%252C%2Band%2BProspects%26rft.aufirst%3DNina%2BS-N.%26rft.auinit%3DNSN%26rft.aulast%3DLam%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw10081054%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DLam%252C%2BNSN%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BYJ%26rft.au%3DMihunov%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w10081054,"coastal sustainability,community resilience,coupled natural-human dynamics,river deltas,Mississippi River Delta","COMMUNITY RESILIENCE,COASTAL HAZARDS,VULNERABILITY,ENVIRONMENT,RECOVERY,MODEL,SCALE",,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Coll Coast & Environm, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA"
20,20,"Astrade, L",Jan-feb 1999 ,"Energy gradient and geomorphological processes along a river influenced by neotectonics (the Saone river, France)",GEODINAMICA ACTA,"The purpose of this study is to link the sediment transit and the flood plain storage of the Saone to hydromorphological characteristics of the hydrosystem, which exemplifies a new approach to sediment dynamics. The study of suspended sediment concentration in terms of temporal evolution, together with sediment deposition in terms of spatial variability, is a way to record the longitudinal evolution of the sediment load, which expresses the available energy gradient from upstream to downstream in hydrosystem. The Saone river is a 480-km-long Phone tributary, with an oceanic pluvial regime, and an average yearly discharge of 440 m(3) s(-1) at Lyons. The watercourse is characterised by very gentle slopes controlled by the neotectonics of the Bresse trough and by Holocene fluvial dynamics. Sediments were sampled during the December 1993-January 1994 flood (2 375 m(3) s(-1)) and the 1995 January-February flood (1 826 m(3) s(-1)). A fine partition into homogeneous sectors, using stream power as well as sheer stress, has been realized on a 400 km reach using longitudinal and cross-sections at one kilometre intervals. This partition, compared with the results of the field sampling, shows that the amount of energy is closely connected to the hydromorphological characteristics of the river.

21,21,"Mohamed, RAM",Dec 2021 ,Comparison of fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing and high-sensitivity sensor spatial surveying of stream temperature,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Measuring surface water temperature spatial variability is needed to estimate the interaction between surface water and groundwater, evaluate fish habitat and thermal inertia, and to estimate streamflow frequency and duration. Fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) has been used in rivers and lakes, providing high-resolution and sensitive temperature monitoring over large temporal and spatial scales. However, in streams with cobbly or bedrock-lined streambeds and variable bathymetry, use of FO-DTS to measure temperature close to the surface water and groundwater interface can be challenging if even feasible. FO-DTS can also be costly, involve difficult installations, and require an advanced understanding of the technology, calibration, and data processing. In this study, we compared FO-DTS stream temperature survey results to an alternative temperature survey method employing a towed transect of high-resolution temperature loggers spaced at 1-m and transported in the stream along the study reach, to measure the spatial distribution of stream-water temperature in East Fork Poplar Creek near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. We assessed the applicability and limitations of the two methods, and quantitatively compared in-situ temperature survey results measured simultaneously with each method. Regression results showed strong temporal and spatial correlation between the two methods. Differences were only elevated near the stream banks in areas that were coincident with correlation slope deviations from unity, which was attributed to shallower water and lower data density. Kriging standard errors were also low at channel center with minor increases near the stream banks. The results suggested that the array of the individual temperature sensors can provide a practical alternative to FO-DTS for thermal characterization of surface water, providing slightly lower spatial and temporal resolution, but with higher accuracy of temperature measurement, with greater simplicity, and with a broader range of conditions where it may be applied.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000706318300082,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B127015%26rft.atitle%3DComparison%2Bof%2Bfiber-optic%2Bdistributed%2Btemperature%2Bsensing%2Band%2Bhigh-sensitivity%2Bsensor%2Bspatial%2Bsurveying%2Bof%2Bstream%2Btemperature%26rft.aufirst%3DRuba%2BA.%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DRAM%26rft.aulast%3DMohamed%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2021.127015%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.part%3DB%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D603%26rft.au%3DMohamed%252C%2BRAM%26rft.au%3DGabrielli%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DCarroll%252C%2BKC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127015,"Hyporheic,Fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing,Distributed Temperature Sensing,DTS,Stream temperature,Temperature sensor","SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER,FLOW,VARIABILITY,DISCHARGE,SEDIMENT,EXCHANGE,RIVERS,ZONES",,"New Mexico State Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, POB 30003, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA"

Considering that cellular networks offer wide area, high speed, and secure wireless connectivity, cellular-connected UAVs have been considered as an appealing solution to provide UAV connectivity with enhanced reliability, coverage, throughput, and security. Due to the nature of UAVs mobility, the throughput, reliability and End-to-End (E2E) delay of UAVs communication under various flight heights, video resolutions, and transmission frequencies remain unknown. To evaluate these parameters, we develop a cellular-connected UAV testbed based on the Long Term Evolution (LTE) network with its uplink video transmission and downlink control&command (CC) transmission.

23,23,"An, S",Aug 2022 ,Coupling Coordination Analysis of the Ecology and Economy in the Yellow River Basin under the Background of High-Quality Development,LAND,"The concept of high-quality development has become the current theme of China's economic construction. High-quality development requires maintaining a healthy and cyclical approach to economic development, which is a challenge in the original development approach. Yet, a great deal of evidence suggests that there is a strong interrelationship between economic development and the ecological environment, and developing a method to quantify this interrelationship is important for studying the extent of high-quality development. Here, we propose a new indicator system using the coupling degree model and the coupling coordination degree model to assess the coupled coordination of economic development and the ecological environment in the Yellow River basin as a whole and in each province. We found that: (1) the economic development and ecological health of the Yellow River basin exhibit a slowly increasing trend; (2) the coupling degree of the economic development and ecological environment is high, indicating that the interaction between the economy and ecology is very strong; and (3) the increasing degree of coupling and coordination reflects the trend of continuous improvement and coordination in the relationship between the economy and ecological environment, and the level of high-quality development in the basin has continuously increased. The results of this study indicate that to continue to strengthen the high-quality development in the Yellow River basin, the contradiction between the economy and ecology should be alleviated, and coordinated development of both should be achieved.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000845582000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1235%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BCoordination%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2Bthe%2BEcology%2Band%2BEconomy%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BBasin%2Bunder%2Bthe%2BBackground%2Bof%2BHigh-Quality%2BDevelopment%26rft.aufirst%3DShi%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DAn%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fland11081235%26rft.eissn%3D2073-445X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DLAND%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DLAND-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DAn%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BSL%26rft.au%3DLiang%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=LAND&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/land11081235,"coupling coordination degree,coupling degree,ecological status,economic development,a Yellow River basin","SOCIAL ECONOMY,ENVIRONMENT,INDUSTRY,IMPACTS",,"China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
24,24,"Jamieson, TS",Feb 1 2013 ,"Using stable isotopes of dissolved oxygen for the determination of gas exchange in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada",WATER RESEARCH,"Gas exchange can be a key component of the dissolved oxygen (DO) mass balance in aquatic ecosystems. Quantification of gas transfer rates is essential for the estimation of DO production and consumption rates, and determination of assimilation capacities of systems receiving organic inputs. Currently, the accurate determination of gas transfer rate is a topic of debate in DO modeling, and there are a wide variety of approaches that have been proposed in the literature. The current study investigates the use of repeated measures of stable isotopes of O-2 and DO and a dynamic dual mass-balance model to quantify gas transfer coefficients (k) in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. Measurements were conducted over a longitudinal gradient that reflected watershed changes from agricultural to urban. Values of k in the Grand River ranged from 3.6 to 8.6 day(-1), over discharges ranging from 5.6 to 22.4 m(3) s(-1), with one high-flow event of 73.1 m(3) s(-1). The k values were relatively constant over the range of discharge conditions studied. The range in discharge observed in this study is generally representative of non-storm and summer low-flow events; a greater range in k might be observed under a wider range of hydrologic conditions. Overall, k values obtained with the dual model for the Grand River were found to be lower than predicted by the traditional approaches evaluated, highlighting the importance of determining site-specific values of k. The dual mass balance approach provides a more constrained estimate of k than using DO only, and is applicable to large rivers where other approaches would be difficult to use. The addition of an isotopic mass balance provides for a corroboration of the input parameter estimates between the two balances. Constraining the range of potential input values allows for a direct estimate of k in large, productive systems where other k-estimation approaches may be uncertain or logistically infeasible.

We pilot this method on sediments from the terminal margin of the Baltic Ice Stream, the largest ice stream of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum. A strong correlation (R-2 = 0.83) between the epsilon Nd and latitudes of circum-Baltic river sediments enables us to use epsilon Nd as a calibrated measure of distance. The proportion of subglacially transported sediments in a sample is estimated from grain size ratios in the silt fraction (<63 mu m). Coupled epsilon Nd and grain size analyses reveal a common erosion source for the Baltic Ice Stream sediments located near the Aland sill, more than 850 km upstream from the terminal moraines. This result is in agreement with both numerical modeling and geomorphological investigations of Fennoscandinavian erosion, and is consistent with rapid ice flow into the Baltic basins prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The methodology introduced here could be used to infer the distances of glacigenic sediment transport from Late Pleistocene and earlier glaciations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

26,26,"Tranel, LM",Jul 2018 ,"Hillslope coupled stream morphology, flow conditions, and their effects on detrital sedimentology in Garnet Canyon, Teton Range, Wyoming",GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS,"Characterizing stream erosion in any steep mountain landscape is arduous, but the challenge level increases when the stream flows through a glaciated catchment frequently modified by hillslope debris. Glacial landforms and stochastic mass wasting in alpine systems may interfere with sediment delivery to downstream sites where detrital sediments are often collected to represent upstream bedrock sources. To use detrital sediments as indicators of erosion, we need to understand potential sediment accumulation in flat glaciated reaches or behind rockfall barriers. This study investigates the stream channel in Garnet Canyon, a glaciated catchment located in the central Teton Range, to describe hillslope coupled channel morphology and the subsequent effects on sediment transport throughout the catchment. Stream cross-section surveys and sediment size measurements of the surface bedload were collected in the field within a glacially flattened segment of Garnet Canyon. Calculations of shear stress conditions allowed evaluation of the importance of mineral densities on potential grain entrainment. The length of the Garnet Canyon stream observed in this study was coupled with hillslope deposits. Critical shear stresses were sufficient to move gravel-sized sediments through all sections when calculated with quartz mineral density and through most sections when applying apatite mineral density. These results verify the application of detrital sediments to evaluate erosion rates or spatial bedrock sources because snowmelt stream flow efficiently moves entrained sediment past glacially reduced slopes and potential talus barriers.

27,27,"Gao, F",Mar 14 2019 ,Assessment of Surface Water Resources in the Big Sunflower River Watershed Using Coupled SWAT-MODFLOW Model,WATER,"The groundwater level in the Big Sunflower River Watershed (BSRW) in the U.S. has declined significantly in the past 30 years. Therefore, it is imperative to assess surface water resources (SWR) availability in BSRW to mitigate groundwater use for irrigation. This research applied the coupled Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Modular Groundwater Flow model (SWAT-MODFLOW) to assess SWR in BSRW. This study aimed at: (1) Assessing the reliability of SWAT-MODFLOW in BSRW, (2) analyzing temporal and spatial variations of SWR, and (3) assessing the potential availability of SWR in BSRW. Calibration and validation results showed that SWAT-MODFLOW can well simulate streamflow and groundwater levels in BSRW. Our results showed that BSRW had lower average monthly total stream resources (MSR = 8.8 x 10(7) m(3)) in growing seasons than in non-growing seasons (MSR = 11.0 x 10(7) m(3)), and monthly pond resources (MPR from 30,418 to 30,494 m(3)) varied less than stream resources. The proportion of sub-basins in BSRW with stream water resources greater than 700 mm was 21% in dry years (229 to 994 mm), while this increased to 35% in normal years (296 to 1141 mm) and 57% in wet years (554 to 991 mm). The Water Stress Index (WSI) ranged from 0.4 to 2.1, revealing that most of the sub-basins in BSRW have net SWR available for irrigation.

Incisions of rivers caused by earth uplift coupled with a drier climate after the Yuan Dynasty have previously been attributed to such irreversible abandonments. Here we use geomorphological analyses, coupled with hydrological reconstructions to investigate the ancient stream patterns in the period leading up to the abandonments. We find that the abandonment of wells, the thermoluminescence age of which is about 640 years before present, in these cities coincided with a stream capture event that led to rapid river valley incision of up to 95 mm/year. We suggest that this stream piracy event lowered the water table in the area and triggered the abandonment of settlements, rather than a change to a drier climate as previously believed. We conclude that when considering environmental influences on archaeological records, geographic events must be considered in addition to climatic change.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000904058000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B326%26rft.atitle%3DAbandonment%2Bof%2Bancient%2Bcities%2Bnear%2Bthe%2BSalawusu%2BRiver%2Bvalley%252C%2BChina%252C%2Btriggered%2Bby%2Bstream%2Bcapture%26rft.aufirst%3DWei%26rft.auinit%3DW%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs43247-022-00657-6%26rft.eissn%3D2662-4435%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DCOMMUNICATIONS%2BEARTH%2B%2526%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DCOMMUN%2BEARTH%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D3%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BBS%26rft.au%3DQiu%252C%2BMK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=COMMUNICATIONS+EARTH+%26+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1038/s43247-022-00657-6,,"MU US DESERT,INNER-MONGOLIA,CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY,NORTHERN CHINA,ORDOS PLATEAU,CLIMATE,HOLOCENE,PLEISTOCENE,EVOLUTION,INCISION",,"South China Normal Univ, Geog Sch, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China"

The hydrological and pollution transport and transformation behaviors in paddy- and corn-dominated catchments were numerically simulated; the impacts of the pollution concentrations, interactions between the migrated water and pollutants in the soil, and pollutant transformations during the pollution export were coupled. Experimental field data from the Heidingzi river basin during the soil thawing period were used to calibrate the model parameters and evaluate the performance. The mass of the dissolved pollutants from soil particles in the migrated soil pore water was the key factor affecting the pollution export into the streams; the water content directly affected the pollution export. The concentration of the pollutants peaked when the initial exported water was high. The pollutant transport processes influenced the pollution export more significantly after the soil water was significantly reduced. The N-S efficiency coefficients between the simulated and monitored flow rates and the pollution concentrations at the outlets of the paddy- and corn-dominated catchments were >0.60 and >0.54, respectively. The system deviations between the simulated and monitored flow rates and the pollution concentrations were <10% and <15%, respectively.

30,30,"Schmid, BH",Nov 2010 ,Characterizing solute transport with transient storage across a range of flow rates: The evidence of repeated tracer experiments in Austrian and Italian streams,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Solute transport in rivers and streams with hyporheic zone exchange and/or in-stream storage is typically affected by the prevailing flow rate. The research reported here focuses on stream tracer experiments repeated many times along the same Austrian (Modlingbach) and Italian (Torrente Lura) channel reaches to characterize parameter dependency on flow rate. Both groups of data sets showed an increase of storage zone area and main stream area with discharge. In either case, a strong negative correlation was obtained between storage zone residence time and flow rate. From the Modlingbach data, no clear relationship with Q emerged for the dispersion coefficient and the dead zone ratio, whereas Torrente Lura showed a clear positive correlation of the dispersion coefficient with the flow rate and a slightly negative Q-dependency for the dead zone ratio. Modlingbach and Torrente Lura results are presented against the background of other repeat experiments reported in literature.In practical applications, the computation of peak concentrations frequently rests on the transfer of transport parameters from one flow rate to another. Using the above Austrian and Italian data sets it was shown that the errors in simulated Modlingbach peak concentrations remain within a 40% margin, if the ratio of flow rates (for calibration and simulation, resp.) does not exceed 2:1. With Torrente Lura, parameter transfer resulted in somewhat lower peak errors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

31,31,"Xu, XY",Jun 10 2019 ,"Mercury speciation, bioavailability, and biomagnification in contaminated streams on the Savannah River Site (SC, USA)",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Water, sediment, and biota from two streams on the Savannah River Site were sampled to study mercury (Hg) biogeochemistry. Total and methyl- Hg (MHg) concentrations were measured for all samples, speciation models were used to explore Hg speciation in the water, and Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) were applied to indicate the vertical profiles of labile Hg (DGT-Hg). Trophic position (delta N-15) was estimated for biota and used to establish MHg biomagnification model. The speciation model indicated Hg methylation in the water occurred on settling partides and the most bioavailable Hg species to bacteria were complexes of inorganic Hg and labile organic ligands. Correspondingly, dissolved organic carbon concentrations were positively related to MHg concentrations in the water. In the sediment, the sharp increase of DGT-Hg around the sediment water interface underscores the importance of this interface, which determines the differences in the accumulation and generation of labile Hg among different waterbodies. The positive correlation between sediment MHg and sulfate concentrations suggested possible methylation reaction by dissimilatory sulfate reducing bacteria in the sediment. The food web magnification factors of MHg were 9.6 (95% CI: 4.0-23.4) and 4.4 (95% CI: 2.5-7.7) for the two streams established with trophic data of biofilm, invertebrates, and fish. Meanwhile, DGT-Hg concentrations in the water were positively correlated to biofilm Hg concentrations, which can be combined with the MHg biomagnification model to generate a modified biomagnification model that estimate MHg bioaccumulation with only labile Hg concentrations in the water. With this approach, Hg accumulation in abiotic and biotic environmental compartments was connected and the different bioaccumulation patterns of Hg in different waterbodies were explained with both geochemical and biological factors.

However, the policy has been reformed significantly in 2013. This case study sets out to trace this ground-breaking and significant reform in a fairly path-dependent environment by using Kingdon's multiple streams approach (MSA).The approach is adapted to the characteristics of policy-making in the European Union, the particularities of the Union's multilevel governance with its institutionalized and well-practised policy-making and almost predictable policy windows. The modified approach helps to separate two windows of opportunity with two different policy entrepreneurs. The first agenda window with the European Commission as entrepreneur prepared the grounds for the decision window with an entrepreneurial group of Member States. The second coupling reframed and refocused the proposals of the agenda coupling and linked cohesion policy more closely with the Union's economic policy co-ordination.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000465181200002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Breform%2Bof%2BEuropean%2Bcohesion%2Bpolicy%2Bor%2Bhow%2Bto%2Bcouple%2Bthe%2Bstreams%2Bsuccessfully%26rft.aufirst%3DPeter%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DBecker%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F07036337.2018.1553964%26rft.eissn%3D1477-2280%26rft.epage%3D168%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0703-6337%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BEUROPEAN%2BINTEGRATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D147-168%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D147%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BEUR%2BINTEGR%26rft.volume%3D41&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+EUROPEAN+INTEGRATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/07036337.2018.1553964,"Multiple streams,cohesion policy,policy reform,multiannual financial framework","AGENDA-SETTING DYNAMICS,MULTIPLE STREAMS,PUBLIC-POLICY,AMBIGUITY,ENTREPRENEURSHIP,GROWTH,IMPACT,UNION",,"Stiftung Wissensch & Polit, Ludwigkirchpl 3-4, D-10719 Berlin, Germany"

Here we show that winter flood events in the UK are connected to Atmospheric Rivers (ARs), narrow ribbons along which a large flux of moisture is transported from the subtropics to the mid-latitudes. Combining river flow records with rainfall measurements, satellite data and model simulations, we demonstrate that ARs occur simultaneously with the 10 largest winter flood events since 1970 in a range of British river basins, suggesting that ARs are persistently critical in explaining extreme winter flooding in the UK. Understanding the physical processes that determine the persistence of AR events will be of importance in assessing the risk of future flooding over north-western Europe and other mid-latitude regions.

34,34,"Ryan, RJ",Oct 5 2010 ,Variation in surface water-groundwater exchange with land use in an urban stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"A suite of methods is being utilized in the Baltimore metropolitan area to develop an understanding of the interaction between groundwater and surface water at multiple space and time scales. As part of this effort, bromide tracer experiments were conducted over two 10-day periods in August 2007 and May 2008 along two sections (each approximately 900 m long) of Dead Run, a small urban stream located in Baltimore County, Maryland, to investigate the influence of distinct zones of riparian land cover on surface-subsurface exchange and transient storage under low and high baseflow conditions. Riparian land cover varied by reach along a gradient of land use spanning parkland, suburban/residential, commercial, institutional, and transportation, and included wooded, meadow, turf grass, and impervious cover.Under summer low baseflow conditions, surface water-groundwater exchange, defined by gross inflow and gross outflow, was larger and net inflow (gross inflow minus gross outflow) had greater spatial variability, than was observed under spring high baseflow conditions. In addition, the fraction of nominal travel time attributable to transient storage (F(med)) was lower and was more spatially variable under high baseflow conditions than under low baseflow conditions. The influence of baseflow condition on surface water-ground water exchange and transient storage was most evident in the subreaches with the least riparian forest cover and these effects are attributed to a lack of shading in reaches with little riparian forest cover. We suggest that under summer low baseflow conditions, the lack of shading allowed excess in-channel vegetation growth which acted as a transient storage zone and a conduit for outflow (i.e. uptake and evapotranspiration). Under spring high baseflow conditions the transient storage capacity of the channel was reduced because there was little in-channel vegetation. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

35,35,"Sakamaki, T",Aug 2013 ,Nonlinear variation of stream-forest linkage along a stream-size gradient: an assessment using biogeochemical proxies of in-stream fine particulate organic matter,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"1. Spatial scale of processes is necessary information to design appropriate ecosystem research and management. In-stream ecological processes are tightly linked with their adjacent terrestrial environment and impacted by modifications of riparian environments, particularly in small, forested streams. Quantitative understanding of how the dynamic coupling of these adjacent ecosystems varies along stream continua is necessary to enhance stream research and management. 2. In temperate, forest-dominated watersheds of British Columbia, Canada, we examined the stream-forest linkage along a stream-size gradient based on biogeochemical analysis of fine particulate organic matter retained in streambed sediment (FPOMS). We analysed FPOMS at 48 stations in 14 cobble-bed streams from 22 to 39m bankfull widths during summer low-flow conditions and tested their relationships with local, forest-related, environmental factors (light penetration, benthic coarse POM biomass, riparian-soil properties) along the stream-size gradient. 3. Carbon/nitrogen ratio of FPOMS (FPOMS-C/N) was distinctly lower in stream bankfull widths larger than an estimated threshold around 76m and corresponded with decrease in N/chlorophyll a of FPOMS and inorganic nitrogen concentration. We found significant linkages of FPOMS-C/N with local streamside environments in streams narrower than the threshold (but not in widths stream nitrogen cycling by algae and consistently lowered FPOMS-C/N regardless of streamside environment. These indicate a nonlinear attenuation of the strength of linkage between in-stream biogeochemical processes and forest-related environments along the stream-size gradient. 4. Synthesis and applications. The relationship of biogeochemical proxies of in-stream fine particulate organic matter with local environments can be a practical tool for measuring the strength of stream-forest linkage. Furthermore, regional- and stream-specific threshold stream widths dividing in-stream biogeochemical regimes can be an important landmark for ecologists and managers to refine designs for stream research and management at appropriate spatial scales. For stream widths narrower than a threshold, reach-scale linkages between stream and terrestrial environments can be a major focus, and riparian conditions need to be carefully managed to protect stream habitats. For stream widths wider than a threshold, catchment impacts on streams at larger spatial scales would be a more important focusShow less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000321762900022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNonlinear%2Bvariation%2Bof%2Bstream-forest%2Blinkage%2Balong%2Ba%2Bstream-size%2Bgradient%253A%2Ban%2Bassessment%2Busing%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bproxies%2Bof%2Bin-stream%2Bfine%2Bparticulate%2Borganic%2Bmatter%26rft.aufirst%3DTakashi%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DSakamaki%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1365-2664.12099%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2664%26rft.epage%3D1027%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0021-8901%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BAPPLIED%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1019-1027%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1019%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAPPL%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DSakamaki%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DRichardson%252C%2BJS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+APPLIED+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/1365-2664.12099,"bankfull width,carbon,nitrogen ratio,nitrogen cycling,riparian forest management,river continuum,spatial scaling,stable isotopes,stream-terrestrial coupling,threshold effect","RIPARIAN BUFFER WIDTH,SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY,NITROGEN UPTAKE,FRESH-WATERS,SYSTEMS,CARBON,TRANSFORMATION,AVAILABILITY,THRESHOLDS,RESPONSES",,"Univ Ryukyus, Transdisciplinary Res Org Subtrop & Isl Studies, Okinawa 9030213, Japan"
36,36,"Li, MX",Feb 15 2021 ,Headwater stream ecosystem: an important source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere,WATER RESEARCH,"Although an increasing number of reports have revealed that rivers are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the magnitude and underlying mechanism of riverine GHG emissions are still poorly understood. The global extent of the headwater stream ecosystem may represent one of the important GHG emitters. A global database of GHG measurements from 595 rivers, indicated that the concentrations of riverine GHGs continually decrease as the stream order increases. Further analysis suggested that high GHG emissions from headwater streams (Strahler stream orders of 1 to 3) could be related to the low levels of dissolved oxygen, massive terrestrially derived carbon/nitrogen inputs and large gas exchange velocity. Through a combination of the predicted river surface areas and gas transfer velocities, we estimated that globally, the rivers emit approximately 6.6 (5.5-7.8) Pg CO2, 29.5 (19.6-37.3) Tg CH4, and 0.6 (0.2-0.9) Tg N2O per year, and totally emit 7.6 (6.1-9.1) CO2 equivalent into atmosphere per year. The headwater streams contribute 72.3%, 75.5%, and 77.2% of the global riverine CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions, respectively. This study presents a systematic estimation of GHG emissions from river ecosystems worldwide and highlights the dominant role played by headwater streams in GHG evasions from global rivers.

37,37,"Fratkin, MM",Aug 2020 ,The influence of lithology on channel geometry and bed sediment organization in mountainous hillslope-coupled streams,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Sediment transport and channel morphology in mountainous hillslope-coupled streams reflect a mixture of hillslope and channel processes. However, the influence of lithology on channel form and adjustment and sediment transport remains poorly understood. Patterns of channel form, grain size, and transport capacity were investigated in two gravel-bed streams with contrasting lithology (basalt and sandstone) in the Oregon Coast Range, USA, in a region in which widespread landslides and debris flows occurred in 1996. This information was used to evaluate threshold channel conditions and channel bed adjustment since 1996. Channel geometry, slope, and valley width were measured or extracted from LiDAR and sediment textures were measured in the surface and subsurface. Similar coarsening patterns in the first few kilometres of both streams indicated strong hillslope influences, but subsequent downstream fining was lithology-dependent. Despite these differences, surface grain size was strongly related to shear stress, such that the ratio of available to critical shear stress for motion of the median surface grain size at bankfull stage was around one over most of the surveyed lengths. This indicated hydraulic sorting of supplied sediment, independent of lithology. We infer a cycle of adjustment to sediment delivered during the 1996 flooding, from threshold conditions, to non-alluvial characteristics, to threshold conditions in both basins. The sandstone basin can also experience complete depletion of the gravel-size alluvium to sand size, leading to bedrock exposure because of high diminution rates. Although debris flows being more frequent in a basalt basin, this system will likely display threshold-like characteristics over a longer period, indicating that the lithologic control on channel adjustment is driven by differences in rock competence that control grain size and available gravel for bed load transport.

38,38,"Derx, J",Nov 2010 ,Three-dimensional flow patterns at the river-aquifer interface - a case study at the Danube,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"The three-dimensional groundwater flow patterns in a gravel bar at the Danube east of Vienna were investigated and are discussed in this paper. The observed groundwater level gradients are highly dynamic and respond very quickly to changes in the river water levels. A variably saturated groundwater model was calibrated to the data to describe the complex dynamics of flow in the gravel bar. The model results suggest that short-term (6-48 h) fluctuations of river water levels cause variations in the exchange flow rates from -351/s to 821/s. The highest rates occur during brief infiltration after rapidly rising river water levels. Simulations of different scenarios indicate that riverbank clogging will decrease the exchange fluxes by up to 80%, while clogging of both riverbank and riverbed essentially stops the flow exchange. The groundwater model is also used to simulate the transport of a conservative tracer. The variation of river water levels over time is shown to increase the extent of the active river-aquifer mixing zone in the gravel bar. These dynamic factors significantly enhance the dilution of conservative tracer concentrations in this zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

39,39,"Townsend, SA",Sep 2011 ,Metabolism in a groundwater-fed river system in the Australian wet/dry tropics: tight coupling of photosynthesis and respiration,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The temporal pattern of river metabolism was estimated for high-order rivers (5-7(th)) in the Daly watershed, tropical Australia, during the dry season (May-October) when discharge was supplied predominantly by groundwater. Rates of photosynthesis (P) and respiration (R) were calculated at 4 sites using the open-channel method based on a model of the river's O-2 budget and Measured diurnal cycles of dissolved O-2 concentrations and temperatures. The rivers were shallow (average depth = 0.8 m), clear (1-2 NTU), and had low concentrations of nutrients (<= 15 mu g/L soluble N and P at most sites) and generally open canopy. At the reach scale, P was limited by light with no evidence of light saturation. An increase in primary producer biomass over the dry season probably underpinned an approximate doubling of P at the 4 sites over the dry season, but increased water temperatures would have contributed, too. P (0.1-4.6 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) in the Daly watershed was similar to rates in a shaded tropical Puerto Rican stream and some temperate rivers but was lower than in nutrient-enriched temperate rivers. We surmise that most P resulted in production of dissolved organic C (DOC), rather than growth of primary producer biomass, which was nutrient limited. R exceeded P (P/R approximate to 0.5), and increased approximately linearly with P (r(2) = 0.79-0.99) over the dry season with no statistically significant difference among sites. The similar environmental setting of the 4 sites underpinned their similar temporal pattern of metabolism. Bacterial metabolism of photosynthetically produced DOC (PDOC) could partially explain the tight coupling of R and P but could not account for the river's overall net heterotrophy. The priming effect of bacterial degradation of labile PDOC to increase the mineralization of recalcitrant DOC (e.g., humic acids) provides an explanation for the river's heterotrophy and tight coupling between P and R.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000293308100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMetabolism%2Bin%2Ba%2Bgroundwater-fed%2Briver%2Bsystem%2Bin%2Bthe%2BAustralian%2Bwet%252Fdry%2Btropics%253A%2Btight%2Bcoupling%2Bof%2Bphotosynthesis%2Band%2Brespiration%26rft.aufirst%3DSimon%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DSA%26rft.aulast%3DTownsend%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F10-066.1%26rft.epage%3D620%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D603-620%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D603%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D30%26rft.au%3DTownsend%252C%2BSA%26rft.au%3DWebster%252C%2BIT%26rft.au%3DSchult%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1899/10-066.1,"river metabolism,photosynthesis,primary production,respiration,priming effect,heterotrophy","GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION,WHOLE-STREAM METABOLISM,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,DALY RIVER,LAND-USE,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN,ORGANIC-CARBON,FLOW,PRODUCTIVITY,VARIABILITY",,"Charles Darwin Univ, Darwin, NT 0820, Australia"
40,40,"Quenum, GMLD",Apr 2022 ,Potential of the Coupled WRF/WRF-Hydro Modeling System for Flood Forecasting in the Oueme River (West Africa),WATER,"Since the beginning of the 2000s, most of the West-African countries, particularly Benin, have experienced an increased frequency of extreme flood events. In this study, we focus on the case of the Oueme river basin in Benin. To investigate flood events in this basin for early warning, the coupled atmosphere-hydrology model system WRF-Hydro is used, and analyzed for the period 2008-2010. Such a coupled model allows exploration of the contribution of atmospheric components into the flood event, and its ability to simulate and predict accurate streamflow. The potential of WRF-Hydro to correctly simulate streamflow in the Oueme river basin is assessed by forcing the model with operational analysis datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Atmospheric and land surface processes are resolved at a spatial resolution of 5 km. The additional surface and subsurface water flow routing are computed at a resolution of 500 m. Key parameters of the hydrological module of WRF-Hydro are calibrated offline and tested online with the coupled WRF-Hydro. The uncertainty of atmospheric modeling on coupled results is assessed with the stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme (SKEBS). WRF-Hydro is able to simulate the discharge in the Oueme river in offline and fully coupled modes with a Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) around 0.70 and 0.76, respectively. In the fully coupled mode, the model captures the flood event that occurred in 2010. A stochastic perturbation ensemble of ten members for three rain seasons shows that the coupled model performance in terms of KGE ranges from 0.14 to 0.79. Additionally, an assessment of the soil moisture has been developed. This ability to realistically reproduce observed discharge in the Oueme river basin demonstrates the potential of the coupled WRF-Hydro modeling system for future flood forecasting applications.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000786097000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1192%26rft.atitle%3DPotential%2Bof%2Bthe%2BCoupled%2BWRF%252FWRF-Hydro%2BModeling%2BSystem%2Bfor%2BFlood%2BForecasting%2Bin%2Bthe%2BOueme%2BRiver%2B%2528West%2BAfrica%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DGandome%2BMayeul%2BLeger%2BDavy%26rft.auinit%3DGMLD%26rft.aulast%3DQuenum%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw14081192%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DQuenum%252C%2BGMLD%26rft.au%3DArnault%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DOguntunde%252C%2BPG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w14081192,"fully coupled WRF-Hydro modeling,flood forecasting,stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme (SKEBS),Oueme river basin","ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER,WEATHER PREDICTION MODEL,NONLOCAL CLOSURE-MODEL,WRF MODEL,EAST-AFRICA,PART I,PREDICTABILITY,PERFORMANCE,SIMULATION,IMPACT",,"African Inst Math Sci AIMS, Sect Remera, Kigali 20093, Rwanda"

Due to their natural and cultural characteristics, rivers have a position where they both affect, and are affected by the urban conversion process. Especially in big cities, since rivers are often not given enough importance in the early stages of planning and urban design, great pressure has been put on them. In this context, the starting point of the study depends on the necessity of handling rivers within their environment, identifying which ones are important parts of urban areas and integrating them into the urban planning and design processes. In the study, first of all the existing state of the ecological structure, land uses, socio-cultural features, technical and engineering aspects, and management structure of the Tabakhane stream and its surroundings in the Turkish city of Aydin, were analysed.Beyond investigating the effects of the Tabakhane stream on the urban ecosystem, other factors for choosing the stream as the research area included: the recreational areas near the stream; the residential and commercial settlements in the area; the industrial zone along the stream; and the urban design and application projects which have been produced by the local administration for the stream bank. In the second part of the study, all data obtained from analysis of the stream, its urban surroundings and people living nearby were evaluated and 'interaction diagrams' based on the relations between the three areas were produced. The interaction diagrams then formed the basis of planning design proposals for the Tabakhane stream and its surroundings to play a more active role in the urban system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000375333900014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEVALUATING%2BAND%2BINTEGRATING%2BTHE%2BEXISTING%2BPOTENTIAL%2BOF%2BA%2BSTREAM%2BTO%2BFUTURE%2BDECISION-MAKING%2BPROCESSES.%2BA%2BCASE%2BSTUDY%2BOF%2BTABAKHANE%2BSTREAM%252C%2BAYDIN%252C%2BTURKEY%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DKilicaslan%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft.epage%3D542%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0209-4541%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DOXIDATION%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D529-542%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D529%26rft.stitle%3DOXID%2BCOMMUN%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DKilicaslan%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DTrue%252C%2BEM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=OXIDATION+COMMUNICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"stream,urban,people,Aydin,Turkey",,,"Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Landscape Architecture, TR-09100 Aydin, Turkey"

Critical wildlife habitat on the main stem requires additional in-stream flows. The watershed is one hosting multiple resources, a variety of users, and managed by an array of state and federal agencies. This study proposes a basis for securing in-stream flows for the Platte River. Candidate water supply mechanisms are suggested based on the way in which Casper, Wyoming secured water for its municipal needs. Canal lining is compared to a dam project, increasing reservoir storage, and purchasing water rights, with consideration also made for water pricing to reduce municipal use. Comparisons are based on economic efficiency, potential water conservation, and property rights criteria. Canal lining, coupled with demand management, is shown to conserve water best, given the set of efficiency and cost criteria for in-stream flow enhancement. The approach offers an opportunity to organize the water supply choice context in a transboundary watershed when quantitative information is limited.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000226582800002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConservation%2Bopportunities%2Bfor%2Bsecuring%2Bin-stream%2Bflows%2Bin%2Bthe%2BPlatte%2BRiver%2BBasin%253A%2BA%2Bcase%2Bstudy%2Bdrawing%2Bon%2BCasper%252C%2BWyoming%2527s%2Bmunicipal%2Bwater%2Bstrategy%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DWaller%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00267-003-0154-7%26rft.eissn%3D1432-1009%26rft.epage%3D633%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0364-152X%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D620-633%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D620%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMANAGE%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DWaller%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DMcLeod%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DTaylor%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00267-003-0154-7,"water conservation,law,management,policy,resource planning,in-stream flow",,,"Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Dept 3354, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA"
43,43,"Liu, X",Mar 2016 ,Cyanobacteria in the complex river-connected Poyang Lake: horizontal distribution and transport,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Bloom-forming cyanobacteria have been observed with increasing frequency in Poyang Lake, China since 2000. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms responsible for the horizontal distribution of these blooms in the main body of Poyang Lake. Specifically, we addressed the hypothesis that colonies of cyanobacteria are first generated in the Eastern Bay (EB, lentic region) and then advected offshore by large-scale horizontal transport processes, with the colonies subsequently found in Northern Poyang Lake (NPL, lotic region). The cyanobacteria biomass in the EB was significantly greater than that in NPL (P < 0.0001), and negative correlations were observed between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentrations in the EB. However, significant correlations were not observed between cyanobacteria biomass and nutrient concentrations in NPL. The peak abundance of cyanobacteria was first observed in the EB, with the cyanobacterial abundance peak in NPL lagging the EB peak by approximately 1 month. These results are all consistent with the cyanobacteria distribution hypothesis and show the potential for the accumulation of cyanobacteria in NPL that are normally considered unsuitable for in situ growth in EB. Variations of cyanobacteria biomass in eutrophic lakes, including Yangtze-connected (Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake) and Yangtze-isolated (Taihu) lakes, were monitored during summer (July-August), and eutrophic or even polytrophic conditions were not observed to support the development of cyanobacteria. Instead, a high rate of water flow with short retention times was the key factor preventing the accumulation of cyanobacteria in these eutrophic lakes. Therefore, the mean cyanobacteria biomass was significantly lower in the Yangtze-connected lakes (Poyang Lake, 1.01 mg l(-1); Dongting Lake, 1.71 mg l(-1)) than in Taihu Lake at Meiliang Bay (13.54 mg l(-1)) or the mouth (3.45 mg l(-1)) (P < 0.0001); however, the biomass more closely resembled Taihu Lake at the center (0.88 mg l(-1)). As expected, the cyanobacteria biomass was lower in the lakes with hydraulic connections to the Yangtze River compared with those isolated from the Yangtze River. This study revealed that hydrological parameters dominated the accumulation of cyanobacterial blooms in the Yangtze-connected eutrophic lakes in eastern China.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000369001400007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCyanobacteria%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bcomplex%2Briver-connected%2BPoyang%2BLake%253A%2Bhorizontal%2Bdistribution%2Band%2Btransport%26rft.aufirst%3DXia%26rft.auinit%3DX%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-015-2536-2%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D110%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D95-110%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D95%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D768%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BYA%26rft.au%3DGao%252C%2BJF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-015-2536-2,"Cyanobacteria,Distribution,Water current,Eutrophic lakes,Yangtze River basin","LARGE SHALLOW LAKE,CHANGJIANG RIVER,FLOODPLAIN LAKE,LOWER REACHES,ALGAL BLOOMS,PHYTOPLANKTON,CHLOROPHYLL,WATER,DYNAMICS,EUTROPHICATION",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Poyang Lake Lab Wetland Ecosyst Res, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
44,44,"Renofalt, BM",Feb 2007 ,Connecting variation in vegetation and stream flow: the role of geomorphic context in vegetation response to large floods along boreal rivers,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"1. Flooding governs riparian plant diversity along boreal rivers but the ecological role of extreme floods is only partly understood. We studied the dynamics of riparian plant composition and richness in the free-flowing Vindel River in northern Sweden, and the importance of reach type in sustaining high species richness.2. We conducted three surveys of riparian plant species richness over a period of two decades. The first and last of these surveys were conducted 1-3 years after significant flooding and the second was carried out after a period of more moderate flooding.3. Our results suggest that extreme floods reduce riparian plant species richness in tranquil (slow-flowing) reaches but that a subsequent period of less extreme flood events facilitates recovery. Tranquil river reaches were also more prone to invasion by ruderal species following major floods. Species richness in turbulent reaches (rapids and runs) remained constant during all surveys. One possible explanation for this pattern is that tranquil reaches become more anoxic during floods because they have more fine-grade soils with lower hydraulic conductivity than turbulent reaches. Anoxic conditions may cause stress and plant death, opening up space for colonization. Turbulent reaches maintain a better oxygenation in the root zone of plants through high groundwater turnover, reducing negative effects of prolonged floods.4. The fact that turbulent reaches preserved species richness regardless of flood magnitude suggests that they are important for the resistance of riparian ecosystems to prolonged inundation. In contrast, tranquil reaches, with a higher water-holding capacity, might instead maintain their species richness during drought periods.5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the importance of spatial and temporal variation in riverine plant species richness and composition. To conserve these habitats at a landscape scale, a full range of reach types is necessary to allow for recovery in reaches where species richness has declined. To maintain healthy riparian zones, river managers should focus restoration efforts on interactions between hydrology, geomorphology and biota.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000243023600016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConnecting%2Bvariation%2Bin%2Bvegetation%2Band%2Bstream%2Bflow%253A%2Bthe%2Brole%2Bof%2Bgeomorphic%2Bcontext%2Bin%2Bvegetation%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Blarge%2Bfloods%2Balong%2Bboreal%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DBirgitta%2BMalm%26rft.auinit%3DBM%26rft.aulast%3DRenofalt%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2664.2006.01223.x%26rft.epage%3D157%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0021-8901%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BAPPLIED%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D147-157%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D147%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAPPL%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DRenofalt%252C%2BBM%26rft.au%3DMerritt%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DNilsson%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+APPLIED+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01223.x,"anaerobic,extreme floods,oxidation reduction potential,plant diversity,redox,resistance,riparian vegetation,river,tranquil reaches,turbulent reaches","PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS,RIPARIAN VEGETATION,DISPERSAL,RIVERBANKS,MORTALITY,SEEDLINGS,PATTERNS,GRADIENT,SURVIVAL,WETLAND",,"Umea Univ, Landscape Ecol Grp, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden"
45,45,"Nunn, AD",May 2007 ,"Benefits to 0+fishes of connecting man-made waterbodies to the lower River Trent, England",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Floodplain waterbodies are reputed to enhance recruitment of riverine fish populations via provision of spawning and nursery habitat, refuge from floods, and increased availability of planktonic food resources compared with main river channels. Notwithstanding, there have been few parallel studies of fishes and their food resources at both main river and floodplain sites. Thus, this study investigated the 0+ fishes, zooplankton and phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) at four main river and four (man-made) floodplain sites on the lower River Trent, England, between May 1999 and October 2004 inclusive. All sites shared the same key fish species, and there were no consistent differences in the densities, growth or condition of 0+ fishes from main river and floodplain sites. Similarly, all sites shared the same key zooplankton taxa. However, zooplankton densities, notably of large-bodied cladocerans, and chlorophyll a concentrations, were significantly higher at floodplain sites than at main river sites. Thus, connection of man-made waterbodies has the potential to enhance recruitment of riverine fish populations via provision of important spawning and nursery habitat, and superior feeding opportunities for 0+ fishes compared with main river channels.

However, the connectivity between water and sediment retention (WSR) in two coarse sediment source areas (tributaries entering the Inner Mongolia Reach, IMR, and tributaries entering the Middle Yellow River, MYR) and deposition in the Lower Yellow River (LYR) have rarely been compared. Experiential fitted models for each river segment (IMR, MYR, and LYR) are loosely linked to investigate the coupling relationship between source areas and deposition area. Analysis shows that, at the zonal scale, the connectivity between WSR in different zones and deposition reduction in different river reaches differs. WSR in tributaries of the IMR may benefit the local channel (IMR) with a priority ratio, and WSR in the stem channel of the IMR may benefit both the local (IMR) and the lower (LYR) channels with almost the same magnitude. WSR in the MYR may benefit the local channel (LT reach) and the lower channel (LYR), while the LYR has more propriety. At the zonal scale, the temporal scales over which changes in hillslopes occur also differ, as WSR in the IMY and MYR during the non-flood season may also contribute to deposition reduction in the MYR and LYR. In total, the loosely linked model may provide information of sediment along the whole river network.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000458947800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BConnectivity%2Bbetween%2BCoarse%2BSediment%2BSource%2BAreas%2Band%2BDeposition%2BArea%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DLi%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DHe%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.15244%252Fpjoes%252F83615%26rft.eissn%3D2083-5906%26rft.epage%3D513%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1230-1485%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DPOLISH%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BSTUDIES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D503-513%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D503%26rft.stitle%3DPOL%2BJ%2BENVIRON%2BSTUD%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DHe%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DYan%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=POLISH+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+STUDIES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.15244/pjoes/83615,"coarse sediment source area,deposition area,loosely coupled,experiential models,Yellow River","CHANNEL ADJUSTMENTS,FLUVIAL PROCESSES,BASIN,TRANSPORT,REACHES,MANAGEMENT,RESERVOIR,SYSTEMS,DRIVEN,MODEL",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China"
47,47,"Merck, MF",Sep 15 2012 ,Variability of in-stream and riparian storage in a beaded arctic stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The extent and variability of water storage and residence times throughout the open water season in beaded arctic streams are poorly understood. Data collected in Imnavait Creek, a beaded stream located north of the Brooks Range in Alaska, were used to better understand the effects of in-pool and riparian storage on heat and mass movement through beaded streams. Temperature data of high spatial resolution within the pools and surrounding sediments were used with volumetric discharge and electrical conductivity to identify storage areas within the pools, banks, and other marshy areas within the riparian zone, including subsurface flow paths that connect the pools. These subsurface flows were found to alter water conductivity and the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in short reaches (10 s of m) while influencing the chemistry of downstream pools. During low flow periods, persistent stratification occurred within the pools due to absorption of solar radiation by DOM coupled with permafrost below and low wind stress at the pool surface. Additionally, one of the shallow pools (<0.5?m depth) remained stratified during higher flow periods and lower radiation inputs due to dense subsurface flows entering the bottom of the pools. This consistent separation of surface and bottom water masses in each pool will increase the travel times through this and similar arctic watersheds, and therefore will affect the evolution of water chemistry and material export.

48,48,"Parshakova, Y",Dec 2022 ,Dynamics of Pollution in the Hyporheic Zone during Industrial Processing Brine Discharge,WATER,"The industrial production of chemicals, including the manufacture of mineral fertilizers, is often associated with the need for the disposal of highly mineralized brines through their discharge into surface water bodies or an underground water-bearing layer. When dealing with surface water bodies, the problem of the hyporheic zone effect could substantially influence the process and, thus, must be examined. We consider a two-layer system (liquid-porous medium) for a detailed assessment of the importance of considering the hyporheic zone during the modeling of brine discharge. A three-dimensional numerical simulation of brine transport is performed for parameters close to the characteristics of the media and flows typical for natural water bodies. The dynamics of a saturated brine in a two-layer system are studied for the period of brine discharging and after the cessation of the disposal, and the accumulation of salts in the bottom porous layer is assessed. Calculations show that a significant amount of impurities is observed not only near the water body bottom but also throughout the entire thickness of the porous layer. Moreover, the obtained data reveal that the effect of vertical stratification dramatically influences the brine discharge process and leads to propagation of the brine into the porous medium with a velocity that is three orders of magnitude higher than the filtration rate in the horizontal direction. As a result, the heterogeneity in the depth distribution of the impurity concentration is significant. In particular, the maximum concentration of salt in the hyporheic zone exceeds those near the river surface by hundreds of times. Impurities accumulated in the water-bearing layer of the river bottom are nonhazardous at low- and medium-flow rates. However, with an increase in the river flow intensity-for example, during the flood period or caused by operating regime of a hydroelectric power plant-the accumulated contamination may become an intensive source of pollution, which significantly limits the water use regime.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000902755700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B4006%26rft.atitle%3DDynamics%2Bof%2BPollution%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bduring%2BIndustrial%2BProcessing%2BBrine%2BDischarge%26rft.aufirst%3DYanina%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DParshakova%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw14244006%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D24%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DParshakova%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DIvantsov%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A8476CJPVscW766UH53yE8&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w14244006,"water bodies,discharge of waste liquids,transfer and accumulation of contaminants in porous medium,water quality modeling","SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,DENSITY CURRENTS,EXCHANGE,STREAM,IMPACT,RIVERS,MODEL,PERFORMANCE,SIMULATION",,"RAS, Inst Continuous Media Mech, UB, Perm 614013, Russia"
49,49,"Lenhart, CF",Dec 2012 ,"ADJUSTMENT OF PRAIRIE POTHOLE STREAMS TO LAND-USE, DRAINAGE AND CLIMATE CHANGES AND CONSEQUENCES FOR TURBIDITY IMPAIRMENT",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Changes in land use and drainage have contributed to channel adjustment in small-order to medium-order streams in the prairie pothole region of south-west Minnesota. Although conversion from prairie to agriculture occurred a century ago, recent decades have seen increased subsurface tile drainage, annual row crop coverage and channel modifications, particularly at road crossings such that channel adjustment is ongoing. Channel evolution in Elm and Center Creeks, two fourth-order streams in the Blue Earth River basin, was studied to understand relationships between changes in channel morphology and suspended sediment concentrations. The construction of drainage ditches and expanded subsurface tiling has connected isolated basins to stream channels, effectively increasing drainage areas of Elm and Center Creeks by 1520%. Sinuosity has been reduced by grading and drainage of first-order sloughs, channel straightening at road crossings and natural cut-offs and agricultural ditching that have shortened Elm Creek by 15% between 1938 and 2003. Stream cross-sectional area was enlarged in response to the land-use and drainage changes. In the headwaters, public ditches are wider than historic channels and entrenched by berms. Unchannelized headwater and upper mainstem portions of Elm Creek are also highly entrenched (up to 1.07 meters below the pre-channelization bed elevation with a bank height ratio?>?1.5) but have not widened substantially. In contrast, the lower main channel has widened by an average of 68%. These channel adjustments contribute to the suspended sediment load and violations of Minnesota's turbidity and Index of Biotic Integrity standards. The watershed has a low sediment delivery ratio because it is a flat, poorly connected landscape and likely delivers less sediment to the Minnesota River than steeper rivers downstream, such as the Blue Earth River. Entrenchment and increased sediment transport capacity in the lower reaches of the river have lead to increased sediment delivery to the downstream Blue Earth and Minnesota rivers. Understanding geomorphic changes will be important for addressing water-quality impairments in the region.
