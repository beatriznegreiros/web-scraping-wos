0,0,"Choi, S",Sep 2017 ,A comprehensive index for stream depletion in coupled human-water systems,JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH,"Intensive land use and land cover (LULC) change along with the gradually increasing effects of climate change have made streams both hydrologically and ecologically vulnerable to depletion. Since stream depletion has a direct impact on human and ecological water use with socioeconomic and ecological consequences, it is imperative to manage streams to keep them in a healthy state. In this study, we developed a stream depletion potential index (SDPI) based on the concept of a coupled human-water system (CHWS) operating at simultaneous, interacting scales, and we tested its applicability to watersheds across South Korea. Eight indicators -precipitation, dry days, effective basin area, stream water usage, return flow, groundwater usage, impervious area, and environmental flow supplied by dams -were identified as the key variables for the SDPI. We adopted the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to estimate the weights of the identified indicators based on their causal relationships. Furthermore, we applied three different weighting schemes for urban, rural, and intermediate areas to make the index more effective and applicable to watershed LULC. The spatial distribution of the SDPI results indicated that the western Han River, the central and southern Nak-Dong River and some parts of the southwestern region of the Korean peninsula are prone to stream depletion from several different causes. The SDPI, by predicting changing streamfiow characteristics, can be used by policy makers and stakeholders to determine a safe yield for both human and environmental stream use without causing a long-term decline of water availability.

Three particular issues, namely (i) the derivation of the stream-function values on separate boundaries, (ii) the implementation of cross derivatives in irregular regions, and (iii) the treatment of double boundary conditions, are studied in the context of Cartesian grids and approximants based on integrated multiquadric functions in one dimension. Several test problems, i.e. steady flows between a rotating circular cylinder and a fixed square cylinder and also between eccentric cylinders maintained at different temperatures, are investigated. Results obtained are compared well with numerical data available in the literature. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

2,2,"O'Driscoll, MA",Sep 30 2006 ,Stream-air temperature relations to classify stream-ground water interactions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Stream-ground water interactions in karst vary from complete losses through swallow holes, to reemergences from springs. Our study objective was to compare stream-air temperature and energy exchange relationships across various stream-ground water relationships in a carbonate watershed. It was hypothesized that ground water-fed stream segments could be distinguished from perched/losing segments using stream-air temperature relationships. Two types of computations were conducted: (1) comparisons of stream-air temperature relationships for the period of October 1999-September 2002 at 12 sites in the Spring Creek drainage and (2) detailed energy budget computations for the same period for ground water-dominated Thompson Run and Lower Buffalo Run, a stream with negligible ground water inputs. Weekly average air temperatures and stream temperatures were highly correlated, but slopes and intercepts of the relationship varied for the 12 sites. Slopes ranged from 0.19 to 0.67 and intercepts ranged from 3.23 to 9.07 degrees C. A two-component mixing model with end members of ground water and actual stream temperatures indicated that the slope and intercept of the stream-air temperature relationship was controlled by ground water inputs. Streams with large ground water inputs had greater intercepts and lesser slopes than streams that were seasonally losing, perched, and/or distant from ground water inputs. Energy fluxes across the air-water interface were greatest for the ground water-fed stream due to increased longwave, latent, and sensible heat losses from the stream in winter when large temperature and vapor pressure differences existed between the stream and air. Advection of ground water was an important source and sink for heat in the ground water-fed stream, depending on season. In contrast, along the seasonally losing stream reach, advection was of minimal importance and stream temperatures were dominated by energy exchange across the air-water interface. Overall, results showed that stream temperatures and energy exchange in this carbonate watershed were strongly related to stream-ground water interactions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

3,3,"Liu, Z",Jul 2020 ,A stream cipher algorithm based on 2D coupled map lattice and partitioned cellular automata,NONLINEAR DYNAMICS,"The two-dimensional coupled map lattice (2D CML) is a spatiotemporal chaotic model with complex dynamic behavior and has high potential for designing stream cipher. We propose an offset 2D CML model by adding different offsets for each lattice. The offset 2D CML model has better chaotic properties, such as larger Lyapunov exponent (LE) and more uniform chaotic sequences, than the original 2D CML model, which provides a good basis for constructing stream cipher. We combine the offset 2D CML model with the partitioned cellular automata (PCA) and propose a stream cipher algorithm. In our algorithm, the PCA is used to control the extraction of pseudo-random number from the offset 2D CML model, which effectively hides the orbit information of system and enhances the difficulty of attacking chaotic sequences. Moreover, some fast nonlinear transform operations are specially introduced into our algorithm to further improve the complexity and the running speed. Theory analysis and simulation test both confirm that the proposed stream cipher algorithm has excellent statistical performance, high security and computational efficiency. It has great potential for guaranteeing data security in the Internet.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000549373200002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bstream%2Bcipher%2Balgorithm%2Bbased%2Bon%2B2D%2Bcoupled%2Bmap%2Blattice%2Band%2Bpartitioned%2Bcellular%2Bautomata%26rft.aufirst%3DZhuo%26rft.auinit%3DZ%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11071-020-05804-2%26rft.eissn%3D1573-269X%26rft.epage%3D1396%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0924-090X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DNONLINEAR%2BDYNAMICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1383-1396%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1383%26rft.stitle%3DNONLINEAR%2BDYNAM%26rft.volume%3D101%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BLY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=NONLINEAR+DYNAMICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11071-020-05804-2,"Coupled map lattice,Partitioned cellular automata,Stream cipher,Chaos-based cryptography","CHAOS,DEGRADATION,DIFFUSION,DYNAMICS,SCHEME,ROBUST,MODEL",,"Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China"
4,4,"Villa, JA",May 1 2020 ,Methane and nitrous oxide porewater concentrations and surface fluxes of a regulated river,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rivers are a critical missing component of current global GHG models. Their exclusion is mainly due to a lack of in-situ measurements and a poor understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of GHG production and emissions, which prevents optimal model parametrization. We combined simultaneous observations of porewater concentrations along different beach positions and depths, and surface fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide at a plot scale in a large regulated river during three water stages: rising, falling, and low. Our goal was to gain insights into the interactions between hydrological exchanges and GHG emissions and elucidate possible hypotheses that could guide future research on the mechanisms of GHG production, consumption, and transport in the hyporheic zone (HZ). Results indicate that the site functioned as a net source of methane. Surface fluxes of methane during river water stages at three beach positions (shallow, intermediate and deep) correlated with porewater concentrations of methane. However, fluxes were significantly higher in the intermediate position during the low water stage, suggesting that low residence time increased methane emissions. Vertical profiles of methane peaked at different depths, indicating an influence of the magnitude and direction of the hyporheic mixing during the different river water stages on methane production and consumption. The site acted as either a sink or a source of nitrous oxide depending on the elevation of the water column. Nitrous oxide porewater concentrations peaked at the upper layers of the sediment throughout the different water stages. River hydrological stages significantly influenced porewater concentrations and fluxes of GHG, probably by influencing heterotrophic respiration (production and consumption processes) and transport to and from the HZ. Our results highlight the importance of including dynamic hydrological exchanges when studying and modeling GHG production and consumption in the HZ of large rivers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

5,5,"Hein, T",Dec 20 2021 ,The coupled socio-ecohydrological evolution of river systems: Towards an integrative perspective of river systems in the 21st century,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River systems have undergone a massive transformation since the Anthropocene. The natural properties of river systems have been drastically altered and reshaped, limiting the use of management frameworks, their scientific knowledge base and their ability to provide adequate solutions for current problems and those of the future, such as climate change, biodiversity crisis and increased demands for water resources. To address these challenges, a socioecologically driven research agenda for river systems that complements current approaches is needed and proposed. The implementation of the concepts of social metabolism and the colonisation of natural systems into existing concepts can provide a new basis to analyse the coevolutionary coupling of social systems with ecological and hydrological (i.e.,'socio-ecohydrological') systems within rivers. To operationalize this research agenda, we highlight four initial core topics defined as research clusters (RCs) to address specific system properties in an integrative manner. The colonisation of natural systems by social systems is seen as a significant driver of the transformation processes in river systems. These transformation processes are influenced by connectivity (RC 1), which primarily addresses biophysical aspects and governance (RC 2), which focuses on the changes in social systems. The metabolism (RC 3) and vulnerability (RC 4) of the social and natural systems are significant aspects of the coupling of social systems and ecohydrological systems with investments, energy, resources, services and associated risks and impacts. This socio-ecohydrological research agenda complements other recent approaches, such as 'socio-ecological', 'socio-hydrological' or 'socio-geomorphological' systems, by focusing on the coupling of social systems with natural systems in rivers and thus, by viewing the socioeconomic features of river systems as being just as important as their natural characteristics. The proposed research agenda builds on interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity and requires the implementation of such programmes into the education of a new generation of river system scientists, managers and engineers who are aware of the transformation processes and the coupling between systems.

6,6,"Marzadri, A",Aug 16 2014 ,A hydrologic model demonstrates nitrous oxide emissions depend on streambed morphology,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Rivers are hot spots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to denitrification. Although the key role of rivers in transforming reactive inorganic nitrogen is widely recognized, the recent estimates of N2O emissions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) may be largely underestimated. This denotes a lack of reliable and robust methodologies to upscale denitrification, and other biogeochemical processes, from the local to the network scale. Here we demonstrate that stream hydromorphology strongly influences N2O emissions. We provide an integrative methodology for upscaling local biogeochemical processes to the catchment scale with a Damkohler number, which accounts for the complex interplay between stream hydromorphology and biogeochemical characteristics of streambed sediments. Application of this theoretical framework to the large data set collected as part of the second Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINXII) demonstrates that stream morphology is a key factor controlling emissions of N2O from streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000341725200022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bhydrologic%2Bmodel%2Bdemonstrates%2Bnitrous%2Boxide%2Bemissions%2Bdepend%2Bon%2Bstreambed%2Bmorphology%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarzadri%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014GL060732%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D5491%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D15%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5484-5491%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5484%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DMarzadri%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DTank%252C%2BJL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014GL060732,"hyporheic zone,stream morphology,nitrous oxide emissions","HEADWATER STREAMS,ADDITION EXPERIMENTS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,RIVER NETWORKS,DENITRIFICATION,SOLUTES,FLOWS,ZONE",,"Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Trento, Italy"
7,7,"Qian, C",2021 ,STUDY ON THE COORDINATION DEGREE OF REGIONAL ECONOMY-ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT COUPLING IN THE YANGTZE RIVER ECONOMIC ZONE,FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN,"In order to further understand the relationship between economic development and ecological environment protection along the Yangtze River, and to seek the future development direction of the region, this paper proposes a study on the coordination degree of regional economic-ecological environment coupling in the Yangtze River Economic Zone. Through the survey and statistics of 11 provinces (municipalities directly under the Central Government) in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the mechanism of economic-ecological environment coupling coordination degree is defined, and the evaluation index system is constructed based on the scientific and typical characteristics of the Yangtze River region through comprehensive expert suggestions. To ensure the objectivity and accuracy of the evaluation results, based on the scores of ecological environment and economic development, we construct the Yangtze River Economic Belt regional economy-ecological environment coupling coordination model, use the indicators to calculate the economic-ecological environment coupling degree, and analyze the Yangtze River Economic Belt Economic-ecological coupling and coordination degree. The results of the study show that due to the influence of regions and comprehensive economic capabilities, the eastern provinces and cities in the coastal cities of the Yangtze River Economic Belt have the highest degree of coupling and coordination, and the western provinces and cities have the lowest degree of coupling and coordination. After comprehensive analysis, it is found that only sustainable development of ecological environment protection and long-term economic development can continuously optimize the Yangtze River Economic Belt.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000712244200057,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSTUDY%2BON%2BTHE%2BCOORDINATION%2BDEGREE%2BOF%2BREGIONAL%2BECONOMY-ECOLOGICAL%2BENVIRONMENT%2BCOUPLING%2BIN%2BTHE%2BYANGTZE%2BRIVER%2BECONOMIC%2BZONE%26rft.aufirst%3DChen%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DQian%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft.eissn%3D1610-2304%26rft.epage%3D12071%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1018-4619%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESENIUS%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BBULLETIN%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D12063-12071%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D12063%26rft.stitle%3DFRESEN%2BENVIRON%2BBULL%26rft.volume%3D30&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=FRESENIUS+ENVIRONMENTAL+BULLETIN&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"Yangtze River,Ecological Environment,Economic Belt,Coupling,Coordination",,,"Zhejiang Int Studies Univ, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China"
8,8,"Keeler, KM",Oct 2019 ,Zooplankton dynamics in a Great Lakes connecting channel: Exploring the seasonal composition within the St. Clair-Detroit River System,JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH,"The connecting channels linking the Laurentian Great Lakes provide important migration routes, spawning grounds, and nursery habitat for fish, but their role as conduits between lakes for zooplankton is less understood. To address this knowledge gap in the St. Clair-Detroit River System (SCDRS), a comprehensive survey of crustacean zooplankton was performed in both riverine and lacustrine habitats from spring to fall 2014, providing the first system-wide assessment of zooplankton in the SCDRS. Zooplankton density and biomass were greatest in northern reaches of the system (southern Lake Huron and the St. Clair River) and decreased downstream towards Lake Erie. The composition of zooplankton also changed moving downstream, transitioning from a community dominated by calanoid copepods, to more cyclopoids and cladocerans in the Detroit River, and to cladocerans dominant in western Lake Erie. Coincidentally, species richness increased as sampling progressed downstream, and we estimated that our single-year sampling regime identified similar to 88% of potential taxa. Other species assemblages have responded positively to recent water quality and habitat restoration efforts in the SCDRS, and this survey of the zooplankton community provides benchmark information necessary to assess its response to continued recovery. In addition, information regarding the lower trophic levels of the system is integral to understanding recruitment of ecologically and economically valuable fish species targeted for recovery in the SCDRS.

9,9,"Welsh, MK",2020 ,IMPACT OF RIPARIAN AND STREAM RESTORATION ON DENITRIFICATION IN GEOMORPHIC FEATURES OF AGRICULTURAL STREAMS,TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE,"Agricultural land use, channel modifications, and riparian vegetation composition can affect instream denitrification by altering geomorphic features, such as sediment texture, organic matter, retention time, and hyporheic exchange. Stream and riparian restoration is widely implemented in agricultural watersheds to mitigate excess nutrient export to sensitive downstream waters; however, the cumulative impact of channel reconstruction and altered channel and near-stream morphology on nitrogen dynamics remains poorly understood. We measured denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) and environmental variables (e.g., water chemistry, sediment texture, and organic matter) in different geomorphic features in agriculturally influenced streams in North Carolina with varied channel and riparian zone characteristics. Our results indicate that denitrification is primarily influenced by increased transport of nitrate (NO3-) to the streams in wetter months. Secondarily, structural factors, including riparian vegetation and stream geomorphology, impact denitrification by controlling the distribution of sediment texture and organic carbon. In the newly restored stream, we observed coarser streambed sediments and low sediment organic carbon, especially in scour pools constructed downstream from cross-vanes. Lower DEA was observed in restored pools (39.1 ng N g(-1) dry mass h(-1)) compared to naturally occurring pools (70.7 to 278.1 ng N g(-1) dry mass h(-1)). These results highlight the need for restoration strategies to be directed at increasing organic carbon and residence times through complex flowpaths (e.g., meanders, root wads, artificial woody debris dams).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000583862000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIMPACT%2BOF%2BRIPARIAN%2BAND%2BSTREAM%2BRESTORATION%2BON%2BDENITRIFICATION%2BIN%2BGEOMORPHIC%2BFEATURES%2BOF%2BAGRICULTURAL%2BSTREAMS%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BK.%26rft.auinit%3DMK%26rft.aulast%3DWelsh%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.13031%252Ftrans.13777%26rft.eissn%3D2151-0040%26rft.epage%3D1167%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2151-0032%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DTRANSACTIONS%2BOF%2BTHE%2BASABE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1157-1167%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1157%26rft.stitle%3DT%2BASABE%26rft.volume%3D63%26rft.au%3DWelsh%252C%2BMK%26rft.au%3DMcMillan%252C%2BSK%26rft.au%3DVidon%252C%2BPG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=TRANSACTIONS+OF+THE+ASABE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.13031/trans.13777,"Denitrification,Freshwater,Nitrogen,Restoration,Riparian,Stream,Water quality","SEDIMENT DENITRIFICATION,MICROBIAL BIOMASS,NITROGEN REMOVAL,WOODY DEBRIS,NITRATE,FOREST,RATES,VARIABILITY,RIVER,SOIL",,"Purdue Univ, 225 S Univ St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA"
10,10,"Schmadel, NM",Mar 30 2014 ,Deducing the spatial variability of exchange within a longitudinal channel water balance,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Developing an appropriate data collection scheme to infer stream-subsurface interactions is not trivial due to the spatial and temporal variability of exchange flowpaths. Within the context of a case study, this paper presents the results from a number of common data collection techniques ranging from point to reach scales used in combination to better understand the spatial complexity of subsurface exchanges, infer the hydrologic conditions where individual influences of hyporheic and groundwater exchange components on stream water can be characterized, and determine where gaps in information arise. We start with a tracer-based, longitudinal channel water balance to quantify hydrologic gains and losses at a sub-reach scale nested within two consecutive reaches. Next, we look at groundwater and stream water surface levels, shallow streambed vertical head gradients, streambed and aquifer hydraulic conductivities, water chemistry, and vertical flux rates estimated from streambed temperatures to provide more spatially explicit information. As a result, a clearer spatial understanding of gains and losses was provided, but some limitations in interpreting results were identified even when combining information collected over various scales. Due to spatial variability of exchanges and areas of mixing, each technique frequently captured a combination of groundwater and hyporheic exchange components. Ultimately, this study provides information regarding technique selection, emphasizes that care must be taken when interpreting results, and identifies the need to apply or develop more advanced methods for understanding subsurface exchanges.

In this paper we present the concept of a compartment approach for the analysis of coupled hydrosystems including heat and mass transport. In this concept, flow and transport processes are coupled via their compartment (or process domain) boundaries without giving up the computational necessities and optimisations for the numerical solution of each individual process. In this new approach, random walk particle tracking (RWPT) methods are integrated into the coupled hydrosystem analysis. We briefly introduce the RWPT method and the governing equations for water flow, heat, and mass transport in aquifers, soils and on surfaces. Flow processes are described by diffusion equations (Darcy equation for groundwater flow, Richards equation for flow in the unsaturated zone, and the diffusive wave approximation for overland flow) which are coupled by exchange fluxes. Transport processes are described by advection-diffusion equations and coupled with the exchange fluxes by advection. We present three application examples concerning flow, mass and heat transport in coupled hydrosystems based on Horton- and Dunne overland flow as well as on hyporheic flows.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000269912300006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bphysically%2Bbased%2Bmodel%2Bconcept%2Bfor%2Btransport%2Bmodelling%2Bin%2Bcoupled%2Bhydrosystems%26rft.aufirst%3DJens-Olaf%26rft.auinit%3DJO%26rft.aulast%3DDelfs%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00767-009-0114-0%26rft.epage%3D235%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1430-483X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DGRUNDWASSER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D219-235%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D219%26rft.stitle%3DGRUNDWASSER%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DDelfs%252C%2BJO%26rft.au%3DKalbus%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DKolditz%252C%2BO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=GRUNDWASSER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00767-009-0114-0,"coupled hydrosystems,heat and mass transport,random walk particle tracking,hyporheic zone","WALK PARTICLE TRACKING,POROUS-MEDIA,OVERLAND-FLOW,SHALLOW-WATER,STREAMFLOW GENERATION,HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,CAPILLARY-FRINGE,SURFACE,SYSTEM",,"Helmholtz Zentrum Umweltforsch UFZ Leipzig, Dept Umweltinformat, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany"
12,12,"Stutter, M",Nov 15 2021 ,Spatial representation of in-stream sediment phosphorus release combining channel network approaches and in-situ experiments,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Impairment of rivers by elevated phosphorus (P) concentration is an issue often studied at outlets of mesoscale catchments. Our objective was to evaluate within-catchment spatio-temporal processes along connected reaches to understand processes of internal P loading associated with sediment input, accumulations in channels and sediment-water column P exchange. Our overall hypothesis was that heterogeneous sediment residence within the channel of a 52 km(2) mixed land cover catchment resulted in key zones for sediment-water P exchange. We evaluated the channel network through ground-survey, spatial data methods establishing connectivity and energy gradients. This gave a background to understand sampling of sediments and P release/uptake to the water column using 90 s in-situ resuspension isolating a portion of streambed over five sets of three-location transects in May (spring storms, recent active erosion) and September (summer low flow, longer sediment residence). Simple transect position models (top, mid, bottom) predicted increased sediment resuspension yields and P contents in lower settings. Sediment P release following resuspension were mean (and range) 0.5 (-0.8 to 1.8) and 0.5 (-2.5 to 3.6) mg soluble reactive P/m2 bed in May and September, respectively, strengthening generally down the transects but inconsistently. Relationships (log form) showed a steepening rise in fine sediments, P content, background and disturbance-released dissolved P, with specific stream power < 40 W/m(2). In-situ methods showed sediments dominantly (12 cases May, 13 cases Sep) as P sources capable of influencing dissolved P concentrations and with potential explanation that heterogeneous locations of internal P loading influence the systems longer-term observed P trends. Combining channel network, stream power assessment and in-situ sorption studies improved the understanding of influential zones of sediment-water P exchange within this mesoscale catchment. Such methods have potential to inform P model development and management. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Both long-term and longitudinal changes in stream temperature were identified and the influences of stream flow rate, temperature and volume of wastewater effluents and air temperature were investigated. Water and heat budget analyses were also conducted for several segments of the mainstream to clarify the relative impacts from natural and anthropogenic factors. Stream temperatures in the winter season significantly increased over the past 20 years at sites affected by intensive and warm effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located along the mainstream. In the summer season, a larger stream temperature increase was identified in the upstream reaches, which was attributable to the decreased flow rate due to water withdrawal. The relationship between air and stream temperatures indicated that stream temperatures at the upstream site were likely to be affected by a dam release, while temperatures in the downstream reaches have deviated more from air temperatures in recent years, probably due to the increased impacts of effluents from WWTPs. Results of the water and heat budget analyses indicated that the largest contributions to water and heat gains were attributable to wastewater effluents, while other factors such as groundwater recharge and water withdrawal were found to behave as energy sinks, especially in summer.

15,15,"Lobera, G",Jan 20 2021 ,Responses of resources and consumers to experimental flow pulses in a temporary Mediterranean stream,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Determining the resistance and resilience of resources and benthic invertebrates connected to instream refuges and species re-colonization in post-flood periods may help to elucidate mechanisms behind community recovery. This experiment simulated flow pulses in a small temporary stream in an extremely wet year, using upstream control and downstream flooded reaches at three sites in order to assess community resistance and resilience (benthos and drift), and analyse resources (periphyton and benthic organic matter) and invertebrates at pre- and post-flood time periods. The hyporheos was sampled in order to explore species exchanges with benthos. Fewer resources and benthic invertebrates at the beginning of the experiment were found than in previous studies when base flow conditions prevailed. Resource stocks and benthic invertebrates showed high resistance to the flow pulse. Interestingly, there was low resilience of benthic organic matter to natural seasonal flooding. Chlorophyll a did not recover after experimental floods; instead, it was reduced after floods, despite the more benign flow conditions and non-limiting irradiance levels, pointing to top-down control by consumers. Additionally, the experimental flood significantly disturbed only the invertebrate composition in the groundwater-fed stream, which was inhabited by the fewest adapted-to-flood-disturbances macroinvertebrates. Despite the low resilience observed, richness and densities of benthos increased during the study, evidencing progressive colonization. Around 50-60% of macroinvertebrates were present in both benthos and hyporheos. Richness increased after flooding, suggesting that the hyporheic zone could be the main source of colonizers. Three species traits characterized the hyporheos: small size, cocoons and feeders of microorganisms within the fine sediment matrix. The main results indicate that longer-than-normal flood periods in early spring may constrain invertebrate succession before the next summer drought in temporary streams. This study underscores the importance of hyporheic fauna as a significance source of colonizers, highlighting the importance of connectivity to the groundwater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

18,18,"Cook, PG",Dec 15 2013 ,Estimating groundwater discharge to rivers from river chemistry surveys,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Environmental tracer methods have been used to quantify groundwater discharge to rivers for the past few decades. A number of different tracers have been used in these studies, including individual ion concentrations, electrical conductivity, stable isotopes H-2 and O-18, and the dissolved gases helium, chlorofluorocarbons and radon. This paper discusses the assumptions of the method, as well as its resolution and accuracy. The method will be most accurate when the tracer concentration in groundwater is very distinct from that in the river. On the basis of typical parameters, groundwater inflow rates as low as 5mm/day can usually be estimated with electrical conductivity and ion tracers. A lower limit of resolution of approximately 2mm/day is usually possible with radon, principally because the ratio of the river concentration to the groundwater concentration will be higher. However, hyporheic exchange can also contribute radon to the river. Where this process is significant, it is more difficult to estimate groundwater inflow from radon activities in the river, thus reducing the accuracy of the method. For CFCs, the lower limit of resolution is approximately 30mm/day. Helium has not been widely used but can potentially be very accurate if the groundwater is old. The method assumes steady-state conditions and so can only be applied when river flows are stable. Sampling resolution is also particularly important for dissolved gases, and uncertainty in where groundwater inflow occurs between sampling points can cause large uncertainty in inflow rates if the distance between sample locations is large. Poor mixing of solutes within the river can limit the method if the river is wide and shallow. When correctly applied, however, the environmental tracer method is able to provide robust estimates of groundwater discharge at a scale and accuracy that is not possible with most other methods.

19,19,"Abboud, JM",Dec 2018 ,Groundwater flooding in a river-connected alluvial aquifer,JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,"Groundwater flooding can occur when the water table rises due to (a) recharge to (or decreased abstraction from) aquifers with low storativity or (b) propagation of the rising river stages into permeable, river-connected alluvial aquifers. The latter type was significant in 2013 in Alberta. A survey of 189 homes along the Elbow River in Calgary examined the basement flooding water characteristics and the initial route of floodwater entry. In homes where the initial route of entry was known, 88% were initially flooded by groundwater, and 12% reported exclusively groundwater flooding. Basement floor elevation was correlated with the severity of flooding (R-2 = .61). Of the 19 surveyed homes located outside of the 100-year overland flood zone, 47% were flooded by groundwater, indicating that groundwater flooding reaches beyond overland water-flooded areas. Hydrogeological modelling demonstrated that propagation of increased river stage into the aquifer could reasonably have caused the observed groundwater flooding. Groundwater flood resilience strategies could include (a) monitoring groundwater levels in flood-prone areas to differentiate sewer backup from groundwater flooding via wastewater collection systems and to provide groundwater flooding warnings, (b) specifying minimum home basement elevation with respect to river stages for specified flood return intervals, and (c) appropriate home construction.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000450089300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be12334%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater%2Bflooding%2Bin%2Ba%2Briver-connected%2Balluvial%2Baquifer%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DAbboud%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fjfr3.12334%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1753-318X%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFLOOD%2BRISK%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BFLOOD%2BRISK%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DAbboud%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DRyan%252C%2BMC%26rft.au%3DOsborn%252C%2BGD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+FLOOD+RISK+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/jfr3.12334,"flood damages,groundwater,mapping of hazard and risk,river","RISK,EXFILTRATION,INFILTRATION,PROPAGATION,SYSTEM",,"Univ Calgary, Dept Geosci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada"
20,20,"Naganna, SR",Jul 2018 ,Variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity in an intermittent stream reach regulated by Vented Dams: A case study,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hydro-geological properties of streambed together with the hydraulic gradients determine the fluxes of water, energy and solutes between the stream and underlying aquifer system. Dam induced sedimentation affects hyporheic processes and alters substrate pore space geometries in the course of progressive stabilization of the sediment layers. Uncertainty in stream-aquifer interactions arises from the inherent complex-nested flow paths and spatio-temporal variability of streambed hydraulic properties. A detailed field investigation of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K-s) using Guelph Permeameter was carried out in an intermittent stream reach of the Pavanje river basin located in the mountainous, forested tract of western ghats of India. The present study reports the spatial and temporal variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along the stream reach obstructed by two Vented Dams in sequence. Statistical tests such as Levene's and Welch's t-tests were employed to check for various variability measures. The strength of spatial dependence and the presence of spatial auto-correlation among the streambed K-s samples were tested by using Moran's I statistic. The measures of central tendency and dispersion pointed out reasonable spatial variability in K-s distribution throughout the study reach during two consecutive years 2016 and 2017. The streambed was heterogeneous with regard to hydraulic conductivity distribution with high-K-s zones near the backwater areas of the vented dam and low-K-s zones particularly at the tail water section of vented dams. Dam operational strategies were responsible for seasonal fluctuations in sedimentation and modifications to streambed substrate characteristics (such as porosity, grain size, packing etc.), resulting in heterogeneous streambed K-s profiles. The channel downstream of vented dams contained significantly more cohesive deposits of fine sediment due to the overflow of surplus suspended sediment-laden water at low velocity and pressure head. The statistical test results accept the hypothesis of significant spatial variability of streambed K-s but refuse to accept the temporal variations. The deterministic and geo-statistical approaches of spatial interpolation provided virtuous surface maps of streambed K-s distribution.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000438003000037,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariability%2Bof%2Bstreambed%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bin%2Ban%2Bintermittent%2Bstream%2Breach%2Bregulated%2Bby%2BVented%2BDams%253A%2BA%2Bcase%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DSujay%2BRaghavendra%26rft.auinit%3DSR%26rft.aulast%3DNaganna%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2018.05.006%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.epage%3D491%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D477-491%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D477%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D562%26rft.au%3DNaganna%252C%2BSR%26rft.au%3DDeka%252C%2BPC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.05.006,"Streambed,Hydraulic conductivity,Hyporheic zone,Spatio-temporal variability,Vented dam,Pavanje river,Geostatistics,Kriging","VARIANCE,RIVERS,HETEROGENEITY,CONSTRUCTION,NORMALITY,PATTERNS,EXCHANGE,WATER,FLOW",,"Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Appl Mech & Hydraul, Mangalore 575025, India"
21,21,"Lian, YP",Nov 2021 ,Double Averaging Analysis Applied to a Large Eddy Simulation of Coupled Turbulent Overlying and Porewater Flow,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Freestream turbulence in rivers is a key contributor to the flux of dissolved nutrients, carbon, and other ecologically important solutes into porewater. To advance understanding of turbulent hyporheic exchange and porewater transport, we investigate flow over and through a rough bed of spheres using large eddy simulation (LES). We apply double averaging (combined space and time averaging) to the LES results to determine the mean velocity distribution, momentum balance, and drag forces. Our simulations show large-scale freestream structures interacting strongly with vortices generated at the surfaces of individual spheres to control turbulent momentum fluxes into the bed. The transition between turbulent flow and Darcy flow occurs over the first row of spheres, where turbulence decays rapidly and turbulent kinetic energy, Reynolds stress, and drag forces peak. Below this region, turbulence is only present in the high-velocity flow in open pore throats. Experimental observations suggest that minimum mean porewater velocity occurs in the first open pore space below the transition region, but our results show that the minimum occurs between the first and second pore spaces. The simulation mean porewater velocities are approximately half those captured in measurements because the model resolves the entire flow continuum while measurements can access high-velocity fluid in open pores. The high-resolution dual time-space averaging of the LES resolves both turbulent and mean flow features that are important to interfacial solute and particle fluxes, providing a means to include turbulent hyporheic exchange in upscaled river models, which has not been achieved to date.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000723106900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR029918%26rft.atitle%3DDouble%2BAveraging%2BAnalysis%2BApplied%2Bto%2Ba%2BLarge%2BEddy%2BSimulation%2Bof%2BCoupled%2BTurbulent%2BOverlying%2Band%2BPorewater%2BFlow%26rft.aufirst%3DYan%2BPing%26rft.auinit%3DYP%26rft.aulast%3DLian%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR029918%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DLian%252C%2BYP%26rft.au%3DDallmann%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DWagner%252C%2BGJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR029918,"turbulent flow,large eddy simulation,hyporheic zone,sediment-water interface","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,NONSORBING SOLUTES,BED PERMEABILITY,OPEN-CHANNEL,TRANSPORT,SURFACE,WATER,RIVERS,FORCES",,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"

Variable and non-linear relationships between sample volume and numbers of taxa and individuals demonstrate that hyporheic densities cannot simply be expressed per L for comparison among studies that have collected different sample volumes. Our results imply that an optimal sampling design for rapid assessment of hyporheic biodiversity and abundance would need at least five samples of 3-5 L to provide reasonable levels of precision (20%). At both sites, 6-7 replicates of 5 L sufficed to be able to detect a 50% change in mean taxa richness with a power of 0.90 and alpha = 0.10. Although this sampling exercise should be repeated whenever accurate population estimates are needed, it appears that the spatial variance of the hyporheos at a fine scale (<9 m(2)) is great enough to obscure detection of potentially large differences when replication or sample volume is small.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000182598500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOptimizing%2Ba%2Bsampling%2Bstrategy%2Bfor%2Bassessing%2Bhyporheic%2Binvertebrate%2Bbiodiversity%2Busing%2Bthe%2BBou-Rouch%2Bmethod%253A%2BWithin-site%2Breplication%2Band%2Bsample%2Bvolume%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F0003-9136%252F2003%252F0156-0431%26rft.epage%3D456%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D431-456%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D431%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D156%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DDole-Olivier%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0431,"hyporheos,taxa richness,pump samples,Rhone River,replication","ZONE,GROUNDWATER,STREAM,EXCHANGE,WATER,CRUSTACEA,COPEPODA,HABITATS,RIVERS,DESIGN",,"Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia"
23,23,"Ng, GHC",Sep 2017 ,Modeling hydrologic controls on sulfur processes in sulfate-impacted wetland and stream sediments,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Recent studies show sulfur redox processes in terrestrial settings are more important than previously considered, but much remains uncertain about how these processes respond to dynamic hydrologic conditions in natural field settings. We used field observations from a sulfate-impacted wetland and stream in the mining region of Minnesota (USA) to calibrate a reactive transport model and evaluate sulfur and coupled geochemical processes under contrasting hydrogeochemical scenarios. Simulations of different hydrological conditions showed that flux and chemistry differences between surface water and deeper groundwater strongly control hyporheic zone geochemical profiles. However, model results for the stream channel versus wetlands indicate sediment organic carbon content to be the more important driver of sulfate reduction rates. A complex nonlinear relationship between sulfate reduction rates and geochemical conditions is apparent from the model's higher sensitivity to sulfate concentrations in settings with higher organic content. Across all scenarios, simulated e(-) balance results unexpectedly showed that sulfate reduction dominates iron reduction, which is contrary to the traditional thermodynamic ladder but corroborates recent experimental findings by Hansel et al. (2015) that cryptic sulfur cycling could drive sulfate reduction in preference over iron reduction. Following the thermodynamic ladder, our models shows that high surface water sulfate slows methanogenesis in shallow sediments, but field observations suggest that sulfate reduction may not entirely suppress methane. Overall, our results show that sulfate reduction may serve as a major component making up and influencing terrestrial redox processes, with dynamic hyporheic fluxes controlling sulfate concentrations and reaction rates, especially in high organic content settings.Plain Language Summary Unlike in oceans, sulfur reactions have not been considered to play a prominent role in the biogeochemistry of terrestrial environments because of much lower concentrations, but recent studies have been showing terrestrial sulfur reactions to be more important than previously thought. These reactions often take place in wetland, stream, and lake sediments, which can contain a mix of both surface water and underlying groundwater. Our study investigated how water fluxes through these sediments can affect sulfur reactions when the surface water and groundwater chemistry differ significantly, such as through influxes of surface water sulfur from mining activities. Using field measurements and a computer model that simulates chemical reactions and water flow, we found that water flux drives water chemistry in wetland and stream sediments. This affects how rapidly sulfur reactions occur, especially in organic-rich wetland sediments. The model showed sulfur reactions to dominate over iron reactions, which contradicts classic chemical thermodynamics. Also, when water fluxes carry high sulfur concentrations into wetland sediments, sulfur reactions out compete production of methane, a strong greenhouse gas. Our results indicate that sulfur reactions can play a prominent role in terrestrial biogeochemistry, and the degree to which it does is affected by hydrological fluxes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000412729100018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bhydrologic%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bsulfur%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Bsulfate-impacted%2Bwetland%2Band%2Bstream%2Bsediments%26rft.aufirst%3DG.%2B-H.%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DGHC%26rft.aulast%3DNg%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017JG003822%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D2457%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2435-2457%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2435%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D122%26rft.au%3DNg%252C%2BGHC%26rft.au%3DYourd%252C%2BAR%26rft.au%3DMyrbo%252C%2BAE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017JG003822,"sulfate reduction,reactive transport modeling,hyporheic zone,surface water-groundwater exchange,methane,iron reduction","ANAEROBIC METHANE OXIDATION,REDUCING PROKARYOTES,REDUCTION RATES,HYPORHEIC ZONE,ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION,BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,ELECTRON-TRANSFER,HYDROGEN-SULFIDE,ORGANIC-MATTER,MICROBIAL IRON",,"Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Earth Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA"
24,24,"Biron, PM",Sum 2018 ,The need for river management and stream restoration practices to integrate hydrogeomorphology,CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN,"There is growing support amongst scientists worldwide about the need for a shift in river management approaches to include hydrogeomorphic processes. However, the degree to which these concepts are transferred to governmental agencies and practitioners varies widely. In Quebec, for example, many stream restoration projects are based on the (incorrect) assumption that river mobility and its inevitable consequences (bank erosion of meanders, presence of woody debris in the channel) are problematic for salmonids. This paper presents examples drawn from current guidelines on stream restoration for fish habitat in Quebec to demonstrate the need to improve the knowledge exchange among scientists and decision makers about the positive impact of river mobility and large wood dynamics on biodiversity. Our observations reveal that existing guidelines for stream restoration in Quebec need to be revised to better integrate hydrogeomorphic concepts and to no longer assume that maintaining rivers in a static state is beneficial for fish. Adopting the freedom space for rivers approach would likely result in improved habitat as it combines natural processes related to mobility, flooding, and riparian wetland connectivity to determine the minimal space around rivers where development should not be allowed, thus allowing river processes to be restored.La necessite d'integrer l'hydrogeomorphologie pour la gestion des rivieres et les pratiques de restauration des cours d'eau Il existe un consensus croissant parmi les scientifiques du monde entier qu'il est necessaire de changer les approches de gestion des rivieres pour inclure les processus hydrogeomorphologiques. Cependant, la mesure dans laquelle ces concepts sont transferes aux agences et praticiens gouvernementaux varie considerablement. Au Quebec par exemple, plusieurs projets de restauration des cours d'eau sont bases sur l'hypothese (incorrecte) que la mobilite des rivieres et leurs consequences inevitables (erosion de berge des meandres, presence de debris ligneux dans le chenal) sont problematiques pour les salmonides. Cet article presente des exemples tires des lignes directrices actuelles sur la restauration de l'habitat du poisson au Quebec pour demontrer la necessite d'ameliorer le transfert de connaissances entre scientifiques et decideurs sur l'impact positif de la mobilite des rivieres et de la dynamique des bois morts sur la biodiversite. Nos observations revelent que les lignes directrices existantes pour la restauration des cours d'eau au Quebec doivent etre revisees afin de mieux integrer les concepts hydrogeomorphologiques et de ne plus supposer que le maintien des rivieres dans un etat statique soit benefique pour les poissons. Adopter l'approche de gestion par << espace de liberte des cours d'eau >> entrainerait probablement une amelioration de l'habitat, car elle associe des processus naturels lies a la mobilite, aux inondations et a la connectivite des milieux humides riverains pour determiner l'espace minimal autour des rivieres oU le developpement ne devrait pas etre autorise, permettant ainsi de restaurer les processus fluviaux.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434066400020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bneed%2Bfor%2Briver%2Bmanagement%2Band%2Bstream%2Brestoration%2Bpractices%2Bto%2Bintegrate%2Bhydrogeomorphology%26rft.aufirst%3DPascale%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DPM%26rft.aulast%3DBiron%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fcag.12407%26rft.eissn%3D1541-0064%26rft.epage%3D295%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0008-3658%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BGEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE%2BCANADIEN%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D288-295%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D288%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BGEOGR-GEOGR%2BCAN%26rft.volume%3D62%26rft.au%3DBiron%252C%2BPM%26rft.au%3DBuffin-Belanger%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DMasse%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE+CANADIEN&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/cag.12407,"river management,freedom space,hydrogeomorphology,fish habitat,beaver dams","HABITAT HETEROGENEITY,BEAVER,BIODIVERSITY,KNOWLEDGE",,"Concordia Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd W, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada"
25,25,"Gao, S",Sep 2021 ,Mapping dynamic non-perennial stream networks using high-resolution distributed hydrologic simulation: A case study in the upper blue river basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"More than half of all streams globally are non-perennial, and thus dynamic due to their expanding and retracting nature. Field mapping in conjunction with observational data from gauges and/or in-situ loggers is a typical approach for studying non-perennial stream dynamics, but these approaches underrepresent their spatiotemporal variability. High-resolution distributed hydrological modeling promises to bridge this gap, thanks to advances in model physics, remote sensing, and computational power. As the first step towards this goal, we investigate the capability of distributed hydrologic modeling to capture stream dynamics in Upper Blue River Basin, OK. Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST), a distributed hydrological model, is used to simulate spatiotemporally varied streamflow at 10-meter spatial resolution and daily time steps. USGS stream gauge data and insitu state logger data are used to calibrate and validate the simulation at the watershed outlet and small headwater tributaries, respectively. Dynamic Surface Water Estimate (DSWE), a LANDSAT product is also compared with simulated water presence in high-order streams. Results show that the CREST model can capture low-moderate streamflow values at the watershed outlet with a log-NSE value over 0.7 in the validation period, while underestimating high flow values due to the daily time step. Also, the calibrated model can accurately estimate wet/dry status as monitored by in-situ state loggers in nine headwater catchments. The dynamic stream networks are mapped over 2510 stream segments using the CREST simulation. Non-perennial streams are the most dynamic in small headwater tributaries (contributing area <2 km(2)) and high-order streams are sustained by perennial flow. As hydrologic interpretation of the stream dynamics, the interannual and seasonal variability in rainfall and evapotranspiration is well reflected by the water occurrence in streams. Across various catchments, a consistent threshold behavior is found between drainage density and unit discharge, indicating the control of runoff generation on the flowing stream networks. The mapping also identifies differences in stream dynamics caused by heterogeneities in land cover and soil properties. Given the prevalence of dynamical streams worldwide, our analysis illustrates the potential for mapping them using distributed hydrologic models.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000685246900030,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B126522%26rft.atitle%3DMapping%2Bdynamic%2Bnon-perennial%2Bstream%2Bnetworks%2Busing%2Bhigh-resolution%2Bdistributed%2Bhydrologic%2Bsimulation%253A%2BA%2Bcase%2Bstudy%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bupper%2Bblue%2Briver%2Bbasin%26rft.aufirst%3DShang%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DGao%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2021.126522%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D600%26rft.au%3DGao%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BMY%26rft.au%3DHong%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126522,"Stream dynamics,Non-perennial tributaries,Blue river basin,Low flow condition,Distributed hydrological modeling,LANDSAT imagery,In-situ state logger","WATER ASSESSMENT-TOOL,INTERMITTENT RIVERS,TEMPORARY STREAMS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,MODEL,FLOW,CATCHMENT,CONTRACTION,CHALLENGES",,"Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA"
26,26,"Malzone, JM",Jul 2016 ,Response of the hyporheic zone to transient groundwater fluctuations on the annual and storm event time scales,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The volume of the water stored in and exchanged with the hyporheic zone is an important factor in stream metabolism and biogeochemical cycling. Previous studies have identified groundwater direction and magnitude as one key control on the volume of the hyporheic zone, suggesting that fluctuation in the riparian water table could induce large changes under certain seasonal conditions. In this study, we analyze the transient drivers that control the volume of the hyporheic zone by coupling the Brinkman-Darcy equation to the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate annual and storm induced groundwater fluctuations. The expansion and contraction of the hyporheic zone was quantified based on temporally dynamic scenarios simulating annual groundwater fluctuations in a humid temperate climate. The amplitude of the groundwater signal was varied between scenarios to represent a range of annual hydrologic forcing. Storm scenarios were then superimposed on the annual scenario to simulate the response to short-term storm signals. Simulations used two different groundwater storm responses; one in-phase with the surface water response and one 14 h out-of-phase with the surface water response to represent our observed site conditions. Results show that annual groundwater fluctuation is a dominant control on the volume of the hyporheic zone, where increasing groundwater fluctuation increases the amount of annual variation. Storm responses depended on the antecedent conditions determined by annual scenarios, where the time of year dictated the duration and magnitude of the storm induced response of the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000383683800021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DResponse%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bto%2Btransient%2Bgroundwater%2Bfluctuations%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bannual%2Band%2Bstorm%2Bevent%2Btime%2Bscales%26rft.aufirst%3DJonathan%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DMalzone%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR018056%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D5321%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5301-5321%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5301%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DMalzone%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DLowry%252C%2BCS%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015WR018056,,"SURFACE-WATER INTERACTIONS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,EXCHANGE,STREAM,FLOW,DISCHARGE,TOPOGRAPHY,INTERFACE,DYNAMICS,SCIENCE",,"Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Geosci, Richmond, KY 40475 USA"
27,27,"Jurisa, JT",May 2012 ,The coupled Hudson River estuarine-plume response to variable wind and river forcings,OCEAN DYNAMICS,"Observations of the Hudson River plume were taken in the spring of 2006 in conjunction with the Lagrangian Transport and Transformation Experiment using mooring arrays, shipboard observations, and satellite data. During this time period, the plume was subjected to a variety of wind, buoyant, and shelf forcings, which yield vastly different responses in plume structure including a downstream recirculating eddy. During weak and downwelling winds, the plume formed a narrow buoyant coastal current that propagated downstream near the internal wave speed. Freshwater transport during periods when the downwelling wind was closely aligned with the coast was near the river discharge values. During periods with a cross-shore component to the wind, freshwater transport in the coastal current estimated by the mooring array is less than the river discharge due to a widening of the plume that leads to the internal Rossby radius scaling for the plume width to be invalid. The offshore detachment of plume and formation of a downstream eddy that is observed surprisingly persisted for 2 weeks under a variety of wind forcing conditions. Comparison between mooring, shipboard, and satellite data reveal the downstream eddy is steady in time. Shipboard transects yield a freshwater content equal to the previous 3 days of river discharge. The feature itself was formed due to a large discharge following a strong onshore wind. The plume was then further modified by a brief upwelling wind and currents influenced by the Hudson Shelf Valley. The duration of the detachment and downstream eddy can be explained using a Wedderburn number which is largely consistent with the wind strength index described by Whitney and Garvine (J Geophys Res 110:C03014 1997).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000303458700008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bcoupled%2BHudson%2BRiver%2Bestuarine-plume%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Bvariable%2Bwind%2Band%2Briver%2Bforcings%26rft.aufirst%3DJoseph%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DJT%26rft.aulast%3DJurisa%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10236-012-0527-7%26rft.eissn%3D1616-7228%26rft.epage%3D784%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1616-7341%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DOCEAN%2BDYNAMICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D771-784%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D771%26rft.stitle%3DOCEAN%2BDYNAM%26rft.volume%3D62%26rft.au%3DJurisa%252C%2BJT%26rft.au%3DChant%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=OCEAN+DYNAMICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10236-012-0527-7,"Buoyant river plume,Estuary-coastal ocean coupling,Coastal freshwater transport,Hudson River","CHESAPEAKE BAY,DYNAMICS,TRANSPORT,SHELF,CIRCULATION,MODEL",,"Rutgers State Univ, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA"
28,28,"Xie, YQ",Apr 2016 ,Uncertainty of natural tracer methods for quantifying river-aquifer interaction in a large river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The quantification of river-aquifer interaction is critical to the conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater, in particular in the arid and semiarid environment with much higher potential evapotranspiration than precipitation. A variety of natural tracer methods are available to quantify river-aquifer interaction at different scales. These methods however have only been tested in rivers with relatively low flow rates (mostly less than 5 m(3) s(-1)). In this study, several natural tracers including heat, radon-222 and electrical conductivity were measured both on vertical riverbed profiles and on longitudinal river samples to quantify river-aquifer exchange flux at both point and regional scales in the Heihe River (northwest China; flow rate 63 m(3) s(-1)). Results show that the radon-222 profile method can estimate a narrower range of point-scale flux than the temperature profile method. In particular, three vertical radon-222 profiles failed to estimate the upper bounds of plausible flux ranges. Results also show that when quantifying regional-scale river-aquifer exchange flux, the river chemistry method constrained the flux (5.20-10.39 m(2) d(-1)) better than the river temperature method (-100 to 100 m(2) d(-1)). The river chemistry method also identified spatial variability of flux, whereas the river temperature method did not have sufficient resolution. Overall, for quantifying river-aquifer exchange flux in a large river, both the temperature profile method and the radon-222 profile method provide useful complementary information at the point scale to complement each other, whereas the river chemistry method is recommended over the river temperature method at the regional scale.

29,29,"Morel-Seytoux, HJ",Sep-oct 2014 ,Factors Influencing the Stream-Aquifer Flow Exchange Coefficient,GROUNDWATER,"Knowledge of river gain from or loss to a hydraulically connected water table aquifer is crucial in issues of water rights and also when attempting to optimize conjunctive use of surface and ground waters. Typically in groundwater models this exchange flow is related to a difference in head between the river and some point in the aquifer, through a ""coefficient."" This coefficient has been defined differently as well as the location for the head in the aquifer. This paper proposes a new coefficient, analytically derived, and a specific location for the point where the aquifer head is used in the difference. The dimensionless part of the coefficient is referred to as the SAFE (stream-aquifer flow exchange) dimensionless conductance. The paper investigates the factors that influence the value of this new conductance. Among these factors are (1) the wetted perimeter of the cross-section, (2) the degree of penetration of the cross-section, and (3) the shape of the cross-section. The study shows that these factors just listed are indeed ordered in their respective level of importance. In addition the study verifies that the analytical correct value of the coefficient is matched by finite difference simulation only if the grid system is sufficiently fine. Thus the use of the analytical value of the coefficient is an accurate and efficient alternative to ad hoc estimates for the coefficient typically used in finite difference and finite element methods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000347979800016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFactors%2BInfluencing%2Bthe%2BStream-Aquifer%2BFlow%2BExchange%2BCoefficient%26rft.aufirst%3DHubert%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DHJ%26rft.aulast%3DMorel-Seytoux%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12112%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D781%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D775-781%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D775%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DMorel-Seytoux%252C%2BHJ%26rft.au%3DMehl%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DMorgado%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gwat.12112,,,,"Hydroprose Int Consulting, 57 Selby Lane, Atherton, CA 94027 USA"
30,30,"Varner, TS",Dec 2022 ,"Contribution of sedimentary organic matter to arsenic mobilization along a potential natural reactive barrier (NRB) near a river: The Meghna river, Bangladesh",CHEMOSPHERE,"Elevated dissolved arsenic (As) concentrations in the shallow aquifers of Bangladesh are primarily caused by microbially-mediated reduction of As-bearing iron (Fe) (oxy)hydroxides in organic matter (OM) rich, reducing environments. Along the Meghna River in Bangladesh, interactions between the river and groundwater within the hyporheic zone cause fluctuating redox conditions responsible for the formation of a Fe-rich natural reactive barrier (NRB) capable of sequestering As. To understand the NRB's impact on As mobility, the geochemistry of riverbank sediment (<3 m depth) and the underlying aquifer sediment (up to 37 m depth) was analyzed. A 24-hr sediment-water extraction experiment was performed to simulate interactions of these sediments with oxic river water. The sediment and the sediment-water extracts were analyzed for inorganic and organic chemical parameters. Results revealed no differences between the elemental composition of riverbank and aquifer sediments, which contained 40 +/- 12 g/kg of Fe and 7 +/- 2 mg/kg of As, respectively. Yet the amounts of inorganic and organic constituents extracted were substantially different between riverbank and aquifer sediments. The water extracted 6.4 +/- 16.1 mg/kg of Fe and 0.03 +/- 0.02 mg/kg of As from riverbank sediments, compared to 154.0 +/- 98.1 mg/kg of Fe and 0.55 +/- 0.40 mg/kg of As from aquifer sediments. The riverbank and aquifer sands contained similar amounts of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) (17,705.2 +/- 5157.6 mg/kg). However, the waterextractable fraction of SOM varied substantially, i.e., 67.4 +/- 72.3 mg/kg in riverbank sands, and 1330.3 +/- 226.6 mg/kg in aquifer sands. Detailed characterization showed that the riverbank SOM was protein-like, fresh, low molecular weight, and labile, whereas SOM in aquifer sands was humic-like, older, high molecular weight, and recalcitrant. During the dry season, oxic conditions in the riverbank may promote aerobic metabolisms, limiting As mobility within the NRB.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000863979600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B136289%26rft.atitle%3DContribution%2Bof%2Bsedimentary%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bto%2Barsenic%2Bmobilization%2Balong%2Ba%2Bpotential%2Bnatural%2Breactive%2Bbarrier%2B%2528NRB%2529%2Bnear%2Ba%2Briver%253A%2BThe%2BMeghna%2Briver%252C%2BBangladesh%26rft.aufirst%3DThomas%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DTS%26rft.aulast%3DVarner%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.chemosphere.2022.136289%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1298%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0045-6535%26rft.jtitle%3DCHEMOSPHERE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.part%3D2%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DCHEMOSPHERE%26rft.volume%3D308%26rft.au%3DVarner%252C%2BTS%26rft.au%3DKulkarni%252C%2BHV%26rft.au%3DDatta%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=CHEMOSPHERE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136289,"Arsenic,Organic matter,Redox transition,Hyporheic zone,Meghna river","WATER-GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,BENGAL DELTA PLAIN,HYPORHEIC ZONE,SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION,SUBTERRANEAN ESTUARY,WEST-BENGAL,SHALLOW GROUNDWATER,SURFACE-WATER,ELECTRON-ACCEPTORS,MASS-SPECTROMETRY",,"Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA"

32,32,"Silva, CM",Jan 2020 ,Gamma-Reload Deployment: Planning the communication infrastructure for serving streaming for connected vehicles,VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS,"Intelligent Transportation Systems may highly benefit from the development of communication networks integrating vehicles. In this work, we study the deployment of roadside units for delivering streaming for connected vehicles. We consider that the proper dissemination of streaming requires a given share of vehicles periodically meeting the communication infrastructure located at the roadside in time intervals smaller than a given threshold. By considering the share of vehicles and time threshold, we propose the Gamma Deployment strategy for defining the location and number of roadside units required for providing the specific coverage. After that, we extend the proposed strategy to also consider the data transfer rate that vehicles receive data from roadside units, and also the data consumption rate of streaming inside vehicles, and so, deriving the Gamma-Reload Deployment strategy. We compare the proposed strategies to the intuitive strategy of locating roadside units at the densest locations of the road network, and the results reveal that the proposed strategies may achieve significant economy on the costs for setting up the communication network, while providing similar QoS.

Runoff from the upper stream interacts with tidal current from open sea in these two systems, leading to a complex hydrodynamics process. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the two systems as a whole to study the flow and suspended sediment transport. Firstly, a 1D model is established in the Pearl River network and a 3D model is applied in its estuary. As sufficient mass exchanges between the river network and its estuary, a strict mathematical relationship of water level at the interfaces can be adopted to couple the 1D model with the 3D model. By doing so, the coupled model does not need to have common nested grids. The river network exchanges the suspended sediment with its estuary by adding the continuity conditions at the interfaces. The coupled model is, respectively, calibrated in the dry season and the wet season. The results demonstrate that the coupled model works excellently in simulating water level and discharge. Although there are more errors in simulating suspended sediment concentration due to some reasons, the coupled model is still good enough to evaluate the suspended sediment transport in river network and estuary systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000343539400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B798579%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BCoupled%2BModel%2Bof%2Bthe%2B1D%2BRiver%2BNetwork%2Band%2B3D%2BEstuary%2BBased%2Bon%2BHydrodynamics%2Band%2BSuspended%2BSediment%2BSimulation%26rft.aufirst%3DWei%26rft.auinit%3DW%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1155%252F2014%252F798579%26rft.eissn%3D1687-0042%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1110-757X%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BAPPLIED%2BMATHEMATICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAPPL%2BMATH%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DLyu%252C%2BSJ%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+APPLIED+MATHEMATICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1155/2014/798579,,"PEARL RIVER,DELTA,WATER,FLUX",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"

We present a bedform-infiltration relation together with a set of field measurements along two reaches of the San Joaquin River, CA to illustrate the conditions required for infiltration and exfiltration of flow between a stream and its undulating bed, and a numerical model to investigate the factors that affect paths and residence times of flow through barforms at different discharges. It is shown that asymmetry of bar morphology is a first-order control on the extent and location of infiltration, which would otherwise produce equal areas of infiltration and exfiltration under the assumption of sinusoidal bedforms. Hydraulic conductivity varies by orders of magnitude due to fine sediment accumulation and downstream coarsening related to the process of bar evolution. This systematic variability not only controls the magnitude of infiltration, but also the residence time of flow through the bed. The lowest hydraulic conductivity along the reach occurred where the difference between the topographic gradient and the water-surface gradient is at a maximum and thus where infiltration would be greatest into a homogeneous bar, indicating the importance of managing sand supply to maintain the ventilation and flow through salmon spawning riffles. Numerical simulations corroborate our interpretation that infiltration patterns and rates are controlled by distinctive features of bar morphology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000413484200016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSubsurface%2Bflow%2Bin%2Blowland%2Briver%2Bgravel%2Bbars%26rft.aufirst%3DE.%2BN.%26rft.auinit%3DEN%26rft.aulast%3DBray%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019514%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7797%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7773-7797%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7773%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DBray%252C%2BEN%26rft.au%3DDunne%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR019514,"hyporheic,gravel bed river,infiltration,bedform,hydraulic conductivity","STREAMBED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,FALL CHINOOK SALMON,RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,EGG BURIAL DEPTHS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,FINE SEDIMENT,BED FORMS,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY,SURVIVAL",,"Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA"
36,36,"Dugdale, SJ",Jan 1 2018 ,Stream temperature under contrasting riparian forest cover: Understanding thermal dynamics and heat exchange processes,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Climate change is likely to increase summer temperatures inmany river environments, raising concerns that this will reduce their thermal suitability for a range of freshwater fish species. As a result, river managers have pursued riparian tree planting due to its ability to moderate stream temperatures by providing shading. However, little is known about the relative ability of different riparian forest types to moderate streamtemperatures. Further research is therefore necessary to inform best-practise riparian tree planting strategies. This article contrasts stream temperature and energy fluxes under three riparian vegetation types common to Europe: open grassland terrain (OS), semi-natural deciduouswoodland (SNS), and commercial conifer plantation (CS). Data was recorded over the course of a year by weather stations installed in each of the vegetation types. Mean daily stream temperature was generally warmest at OS and coolest at CS. Energy gains at all sites were dominated by shortwave radiation, whereas losses where principally due to longwave and latent heat flux. The magnitude of shortwave radiation received at the water surface was strongly dependent upon vegetation type, with OS and SNS woodland sites receiving approximately 6x and 4x (respectively) the incoming solar radiation of CS. Although CS lost less energy through longwave or latent fluxes than the other sites, net surface heat flux was ordered OS > SNS > CS, mirroring the stream temperature results. These findings demonstrate that energy fluxes at the air-water interface vary substantially between different riparian forest types and that stream temperature response to bankside vegetation depends upon the type of vegetation present. These results present new insights into the conditions under which riparian vegetation shading is optimal for the reduction of surface heat fluxes and have important implications for the development of 'best-practice' tree planting strategies to moderate summer temperature extremes in rivers.

37,37,"Michaelis, T",Sep 21 2022 ,High-resolution vertical biogeochemical profiles in the hyporheic zone reveal insights into microbial methane cycling,BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Facing the challenges of climate change, policy making relies on sound greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. Rivers and streams emit large quantities of the potent GHG methane (CH4), but their global impact on atmospheric CH4 concentrations is highly uncertain. In situ data from the hyporheic zone (HZ), where most CH4 is produced and some of it can be oxidized to CO2, are lacking for an accurate description of CH4 production and consumption in streams. To address this, we recorded high-resolution depth-resolved geochemical profiles at five different locations in the stream bed of the river Moosach, southern Germany. Specifically, we measured pore-water concentrations and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) of dissolved CH4 as well as relevant electron acceptors for oxidation with a 1 cm vertical depth resolution. Findings were interpreted with the help of a numerical model, and 16S rRNA gene analyses added information on the microbial community at one of the locations. Our data confirm with pore-water CH4 concentrations of up to 1000 mu mol L-1 that large quantities of CH4 are produced in the HZ. Stable isotope measurements of CH4 suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis represents a dominant pathway for CH4 production in the HZ of the river Moosach, while a relatively high abundance of a novel group of methanogenic archaea, the Candidatus ""Methanomethyliales"" (phylum Candidatus ""Verstraetearchaeota""), indicate that CH4 production through H-2 dependent methylotrophic methanogenesis might also be an important CH4 source. Combined isotopic and modeling results clearly implied CH4 oxidation processes at one of the sampled locations, but due to the steep chemical gradients and the close proximity of the oxygen and nitrate reduction zones, no single electron acceptor for this process could be identified. Nevertheless, the numerical modeling results showed potential not only for aerobic CH4 oxidation but also for anaerobic oxidation of CH4 coupled to denitrification. In addition, the nitrate-methane transition zone was characterized by an increased relative abundance of microbial groups (Crenothrix, NC10) known to mediate nitrate and nitrite-dependent methane oxidation in the hyporheic zone.This study demonstrates substantial CH4 production in hyporheic sediments, a potential for aerobic and anaerobic CH4 oxidation, and underlines the high spatiotemporal variability in this habitat.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000855778600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHigh-resolution%2Bvertical%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bprofiles%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Breveal%2Binsights%2Binto%2Bmicrobial%2Bmethane%2Bcycling%26rft.aufirst%3DTamara%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DMichaelis%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fbg-19-4551-2022%26rft.eissn%3D1726-4189%26rft.epage%3D4569%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1726-4170%26rft.issue%3D18%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4551-4569%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4551%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DMichaelis%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DWunderlich%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DEinsiedl%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/bg-19-4551-2022,,"ANAEROBIC OXIDATION,SULFATE REDUCTION,WATER,CARBON,RIVER,NITRATE,MARINE,METHANOGENESIS,ENVIRONMENTS,SEDIMENT",,"Tech Univ Munich, Sch Engn & Design, Chair Hydrogeol, D-80333 Munich, Germany"
38,38,"Schade, JD",Mar 2005 ,Hydrologic exchange and N uptake by riparian vegetation in an arid-land stream,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Riparian zones can strongly influence the exchange of nutrients between streams and their watersheds. Most riparian studies have been done in mesic watersheds, which differ significantly from arid-land watersheds hydrologically. The goals of our work were to determine the strength and direction of hydrologic linkages between stream and riparian zone, and to estimate the extent of uptake of streamwater N by riparian trees in Sycamore Creek, a Sonoran Desert stream. Br and (NH4-)-N-15 were added simultaneously to the surface stream to trace water and N from stream to riparian zone. Br concentrations in riparian wells installed downstream of the release point increased during the addition, demonstrating a strong hydrologic linkage from stream to riparian zone. Percentage stream water in wells increased in a downstream direction, Suggesting little or no input of water laterally from uplands or vertically from deep groundwater. Leaf and wood samples collected from willow trees downstream of the addition point became significantly labeled with N-15 during the addition, indicating uptake of streamwater N. Other tree species did not become labeled, most likely because they were located farther from the stream channel than the willows. Results from our study provide evidence of strong hydrologic linkage between stream and riparian zone and suggest that N demand by riparian vegetation is a potentially significant sink for streamwater N.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000227149900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bexchange%2Band%2BN%2Buptake%2Bby%2Briparian%2Bvegetation%2Bin%2Ban%2Barid-land%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DJD%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DSchade%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F0887-3593%25282005%2529024%253C0019%253AHEANUB%253E2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D28%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D19-28%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D19%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DSchade%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DWelter%252C%2BJR%26rft.au%3DGrimm%252C%2BNB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1899/0887-3593(2005)024<0019:HEANUB>2.0.CO;2,"riparian,nitrogen retention,hydrologic exchange,nitrogen uptake,tracer tests","DESERT STREAM,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,NITRATE REMOVAL,HYPORHEIC ZONE,FOREST,GROUNDWATER,PATTERNS,TRANSFORMATIONS,CALIFORNIA,WATERSHEDS",,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Integrat Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA"
39,39,"Boulton, AJ",Jun 2000 ,River ecosystem health down under: Assessing ecological condition in riverine groundwater zones in Australia,ECOSYSTEM HEALTH,"Below many rivers and extending laterally beneath their banks lies a zone of saturated sediments-the hyporheic zone. This region is the site of dynamic exchanges of water and materials between the groundwater below, lateral alluvial aquifers, and the river flowing above. In this centrally located ecosystem component, the actions of the microbial biofilms coating the sediments are considered to act like a biological filter, enhancing water quality during the exchange process. However, the hyporheic zones in many rivers are threatened by siltation, toxicants and increasing acidity, physical extraction for gravel, or altered groundwater inputs through pumping. Current protocols to assess river health do not explicitly consider that of the hyporheic zone, despite its central role in many rivers. This oversight is due largely to the relative infancy of the discipline of hyporheic research, limited communication to river managers by ecologists, and technical difficulties in sampling the hyporheic zone. Ecosystem health assessments in rivers with potentially important hyporheic zones could include measurements of the extent of hydrological exchange between the river and the hyporheic zone at a range of scales, the rates of some key interstitial chemical processes, and perhaps the biodiversity of hyporheic invertebrates. In Australia, the potential of some of these measurements is being investigated, especially in relation to assessing the health of ""groundwater-dependent ecosystems.""Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000087945900005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiver%2Becosystem%2Bhealth%2Bdown%2Bunder%253A%2BAssessing%2Becological%2Bcondition%2Bin%2Briverine%2Bgroundwater%2Bzones%2Bin%2BAustralia%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1526-0992.2000.00011.x%26rft.epage%3D118%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1076-2825%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSYSTEM%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D108-118%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D108%26rft.stitle%3DECOSYST%2BHEALTH%26rft.volume%3D6&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=ECOSYSTEM+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1526-0992.2000.00011.x,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,INTEGRATING HYDROLOGY,WESTERN-AUSTRALIA,EXCHANGE,WATER,PERSPECTIVE,SEDIMENT,DYNAMICS",,"Univ New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia"

We used detailed field observations of the Truckee River, Nevada from 2003 to 2009 to quantify fluid flux between the river and a fluvial island, the streambed, and the adjacent stream bank. We constructed a 3-D numerical flow and heat transport model to further quantify the complex flow paths. Our study expands on previous research typically confined to less comprehensive scales and dimensions, and highlights the transient multidimensionality of the flow field. In fact, 1-D vertical streambed flux estimates indicated that the channel bar tail displayed the highest upward flux throughout the summer; however, 3-D model results indicated that the horizontal contribution was two orders of magnitude higher than the vertical contribution. The channel bar net flux is typically 1.5 orders of magnitude greater than the adjacent stream banks and an order of magnitude less than net streambed fluxes, indicating significant differences in river-aquifer interactions between each of the geomorphic units. Modeling simulations further indicated that the channel bar induces 6 times more fluid flux than an identical location without a fluvial island, consistent with flux estimates from a nearby river restoration location. Moreover, event-based and seasonal transient antecedent moisture and near-stream storage conditions contribute to multidimensional river-groundwater interactions. These results suggest that fluvial islands are a key driver and significant component of river-groundwater interactions and hyporheic flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000305352500003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW06512%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bfluvial%2Bisland%252C%2Bstreambed%252C%2Band%2Bstream%2Bbank%2Bon%2Bsurface%2Bwater-groundwater%2Bfluxes%2Band%2Bwater%2Btable%2Bdynamics%26rft.aufirst%3DChristopher%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DCL%26rft.aulast%3DShope%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011564%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DShope%252C%2BCL%26rft.au%3DConstantz%252C%2BJE%26rft.au%3DMcKay%252C%2BWA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2011WR011564,,"HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE FLOWS,GRAVEL-BED RIVER,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,NONSORBING SOLUTES,LOSING STREAM,HEAT,ZONE,CHANNEL,TEMPERATURE,TRANSPORT",,"Univ Bayreuth, Dept Hydrol, Univ Str 30, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany"

An integrated modeling approach, combining hydrological and coupled hydrodynamic-fecal indicator bacteria models, was applied to selected scenarios of relevant forcings, on the basis of previously calibrated and validated model applications. The forcings investigated included: tides, winds, waves, atmospheric pressure, bathymetry, river flow, and upstream fecal bacteria concentrations; this study targeted the characterization of the relative importance of these factors on the fecal contamination dynamics, to enhance our understanding of small coastal streams water quality dynamics. Results highlight distinct patterns for dry and wet periods. Fecal bacteria transport is mainly forced by tidal propagation, in dry periods; and by freshwater flows, during wet periods. The analysis reveals a complex hydraulic and water quality dynamic resulting from the interactions between the environmental forcings and strongly dependent on their relative strength. This analysis can be extrapolated for systems with a similar balance between the environmental factors.

42,42,"Brunke, M",1999 ,Colmation and depth filtration within streambeds: Retention of particles in hyporheic interstices,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY,"Colmation refers to the retention processes that can lead to the clogging of the top layer of channel sediments and decolmation refers to the resuspension of deposited fine particles. Internal colmation, clogging of the interstices directly below the armor layer, may form a thin seal that disconnects surface water from hyporheic water by inhibiting exchange processes. The settling of particles under low flow conditions can cause external colmation. Colmated channel sediments are characterized by reduced porosity and hydraulic conductivity as well as by a consolidated texture. The term 'depth filtration' refers to the transport and storage of fine matrix sediments in interstitial layers. Depth filtration is of significance for the transport of colloidal and fine particulate inorganic as well as organic matter within the hyporheic interstices and into the alluvial aquifer. The role of depth filtration is assessed for the content (given in mg/per liter) of matrix fine particles retained in the coarse framework sediment of a gravel-bed;river in Switzerland. Sediment samples were taken by freeze-coring with liquid nitrogen down to 70 cm depth and by piezometers down to 150 cm depth. Seventy-two percent of the mobile matrix fine particles were smaller than 0.1 mm and 50% were smaller than 0.03 mm. The content of fines tended to increase with depth, although higher accumulations were found at intermediate depths in sediments influenced by 'exfiltrating ground water. Interstitial detrital particles >90 mu m showed vertical distribution patterns opposing those of total particles.

43,43,"Kunkel, U",Aug 1 2011 ,Reactive Tracer Test To Evaluate the Fate of Pharmaceuticals in Rivers,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"The fate of pharmaceutically active substances in rivers is still only incompletely understood, especially as the knowledge transfer from laboratory experiments to the real world is complicated by factors like turbidity, hydrodynamics, or heterogeneity. Therefore, we performed a tracer test with pharmaceutically active substances to study their fate and the importance of individual attenuation mechanisms in situ. The experiment was carried out at a small stream in central Sweden. Two dye tracers and six pharmaceuticals were injected as Dirac pulse and water was sampled at five downstream sites along a 16-km-long river reach. Ibuprofen and clofibric acid were the only compounds which were eliminated along the study reach at half-life times of 10 h and 2.5 d, respectively. Based on the shape of the breakthrough curves and the low hydraulic conductivity of the river bed, we can assume that exchange of river water with the hyporheic zone was minor. Thus, the contribution of processes in the hyporheic zone to the attenuation of pharmaceuticals was low. We hypothesize that ibuprofen and clofibric acid were transformed by in-stream biofilms growing on submerged macrophytes and at the water-sediment interface. Phototransformation and sorption were ruled out as major attenuation processes. No attenuation of bezafibrate, diclofenac, metoprolol, and naproxen was observed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000293196400017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DReactive%2BTracer%2BTest%2BTo%2BEvaluate%2Bthe%2BFate%2Bof%2BPharmaceuticals%2Bin%2BRivers%26rft.aufirst%3DUwe%26rft.auinit%3DU%26rft.aulast%3DKunkel%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes104320n%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D6302%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D15%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6296-6302%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6296%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DKunkel%252C%2BU%26rft.au%3DRadke%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es104320n,,"WASTE-WATER,ACIDIC PHARMACEUTICALS,CLOFIBRIC ACID,RHODAMINE-WT,ATTENUATION,STREAM,BIODEGRADATION,CONTAMINANTS,DEGRADATION,METABOLITES",,"Univ Bayreuth, Dept Hydrol, BayCEER, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany"
44,44,"Angermann, L",Dec 19 2012 ,A 3D analysis algorithm to improve interpretation of heat pulse sensor results for the determination of small-scale flow directions and velocities in the hyporheic zone,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hyporheic zone is strongly influenced by the adjacent surface water and groundwater systems. It is subject to hydraulic head and pressure fluctuations at different space and time scales, causing dynamic and heterogeneous flow patterns. These patterns are crucial for many biogeochemical processes in the shallow sediment and need to be considered in investigations of this hydraulically dynamic and biogeochemical active interface. For this purpose a device employing heat as an artificial tracer and a data analysis routine were developed. The method aims at measuring hyporheic flow direction and velocity in three dimensions at a scale of a few centimeters. A short heat pulse is injected into the sediment by a point source and its propagation is detected by up to 24 temperature sensors arranged cylindrically around the heater. The resulting breakthrough curves are analyzed using an analytical solution of the heat transport equation. The device was tested in two laboratory flow-through tanks with defined flow velocities and directions. Using different flow situations and sensor arrays the sensitivity of the method was evaluated. After operational reliability was demonstrated in the laboratory, its applicability in the field was tested in the hyporheic zone of a low gradient stream with sandy streambed in NE-Germany. Median and maximum flow velocity in the hyporheic zone at the site were determined as 0.9 x 10(-4) and 2.1 x 10(-4) m s(-1) respectively. Horizontal flow components were found to be spatially very heterogeneous, while vertical flow component appear to be predominantly driven by the streambed morphology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

45,45,"Chen, XH",Feb 15 2007 ,"Hydrologic connections of a stream-aquifer-vegetation zone in south-central Platte River valley, Nebraska",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Field investigation and numerical modeling approaches were used to examine the hydrologic relations between the Platte River and the adjacent alluvial aquifer and riparian zone in south-central Nebraska. Field methods include direct-push techniques for coring and electric logging in the river channel, permeameter tests for estimating the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed, and monitoring of groundwater levels responding to changes in stream stages and to groundwater evapotranspiration. The channel sediments consist mostly of coarse sand and gravels at the study site with large values of horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity. Groundwater in the riparian zone responded nearly simultaneously to the changes in stream stages, and diurnal fluctuations of the water table are correlated with fluctuations of stream stage in summer. All these indicate a well-connected river-aquifer-vegetation hydrologic system. Numerical models, based on the Gaterkin finite element method, were developed to construct detailed flow nets for examining the changes in the patterns of groundwater flow dynamics resulting from the use of groundwater and stream water by riparian vegetation. Simulation results suggest that a number of hydrologic factors, such as the thickness of the aquifer and vertical anisotropy of aquifer hydraulic conductivity, also affect the flow patterns. Vertical flow is a major component, more significant than the horizontal flow below the river and the vegetation zone in the growing season. Groundwater evapotranspiration can bring deeper groundwater to the water table by hydraulic lift. This function of riparian vegetation could cause a complicated situation in an investigation of groundwater quality in riparian zones. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

46,46,"New, AL",Aug 2021 ,Labrador Slope Water connects the subarctic with the Gulf Stream,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Labrador Slope Water (LSLW) is a relatively fresh and cool water mass that originates from the Labrador Current in the subarctic and is known to occur in the Eastern Slope Sea on the US-Canadian shelf-slope north of the Gulf Stream. It has potential densities of 27.4-27.65 kg m(-3). Using ocean observations, we show here that the LSLW penetrates as a boundary current deeply into the Western Slope Sea (west of 66 degrees W) as a salinity minimum between 400 and 600 m, bringing it into close proximity with the Gulf Stream. The LSLW at Line W (near 69 degrees W) also spreads across, and brings fresher and thicker waters to, the Slope Sea north of the Gulf Stream. A high-resolution ocean model simulation shows that the spreading of the LSLW occurs throughout the entire Slope Sea through the extrusion of fine-scale filaments from the boundary current following interaction with Gulf Stream meanders and eddies. At Line W, the LSLW is also found to be fresher and thicker between 2003 and 2008, when the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) at 26 degrees N is higher (by 3 Sv), and the Shelf Slope Front is further south (by 0.7 degrees), compared to AMOC low conditions in 2009-2014. The thicker LSLW causes lighter isopycnals to rise over the shelf slope, and through increasing the lateral density gradient contributes an additional 1.3 Sv to the Gulf Stream transport. These changes to the LSLW and the Shelf Slope Front are likely to result from an enhanced flow of the Labrador Current into the Slope Sea, caused by changes in the wind stress in the subpolar gyre. The transport of the LSLW (as opposed to the deeper Labrador Sea Water) thereby offers a potential new mechanism for decadal variability in the Atlantic climate system, through connecting changes in the subarctic with subsequent variability in the Gulf Stream and AMOC.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000678348600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B084019%26rft.atitle%3DLabrador%2BSlope%2BWater%2Bconnects%2Bthe%2Bsubarctic%2Bwith%2Bthe%2BGulf%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DAL%26rft.aulast%3DNew%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1088%252F1748-9326%252Fac1293%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1748-9326%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D16%26rft.au%3DNew%252C%2BAL%26rft.au%3DSmeed%252C%2BDA%26rft.au%3DSanchez-Franks%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1088/1748-9326/ac1293,"Labrador Slope Water,Slope Sea,Gulf Stream,Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,climate variability","WESTERN BOUNDARY CURRENT,NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION,OCEAN TEMPERATURE,MODE WATER,CIRCULATION,VARIABILITY,DEEP,SEA,SYSTEM,REGION",,"Natl Oceanog Ctr, European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, England"

This article analyzed changes of pCO(2) and CO2 efflux with discharge in 813 conterminous US streams and rivers. Half of the streams and rivers (49%) showed positive pCO(2)-discharge responses, while significantly more (80%) showed positive CO2 efflux-discharge responses. More CO2 efflux therefore occurred at higher discharge. While CO2 efflux tended to increase with discharge at all stream orders, pCO(2) tended to decrease with discharge in small rivers (stream order 1-6) and increase in large rivers (stream order 7-10). Small streams and rivers tended to release more CO2 at higher discharge due to highly responsive gas transfer velocity. While high CO2 efflux in small streams (stream order 1-3) pointed to strong terrestrial input, high CO2 responsiveness in large rivers was likely due to increased riverine metabolism and river-corridor exchanges.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000456697200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2BpCO%25282%2529%2Band%2BCO2%2Befflux%2Bin%2BUS%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DShaoda%26rft.auinit%3DSD%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Flol2.10095%26rft.eissn%3D2378-2242%26rft.epage%3D435%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D428-435%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D428%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D3%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BSD%26rft.au%3DRaymond%252C%2BPA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DOc7Fes9PXVxdLWbE1bT&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/lol2.10095,,"CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,DISCHARGE RELATIONSHIPS,METABOLISM,EXPORT,SEDIMENT,DYNAMICS",,"Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA"
48,48,"Dara, R",Dec 2019 ,Identification of floodplain and riverbed sediment heterogeneity in a meandering UK lowland stream by ground penetrating radar,JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS,"Complex spatial heterogeneity in riverbed and floodplain sediments control the spatio-temporal exchange of groundwater and surface water in the hyporheic zone, inducing hot spots of microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling. However, the characterization of hyporheic exchange dynamics has thus far failed to adequately account for the complex subsurface heterogeneity of river bed sediments in a spatial explicitly manner, in particular for highly complex lowland river bed sediments. Here we demonstrate the ability of ground penetrating radar (GPR) to efficiently map floodplain and river bed sediment structures within a lowland meandering river. The aim of this study was to delineate the type and spatial extent of complex, texturally heterogeneous facies of high and low conductive streambed materials. GPR surveys in this study involved not only state-of-the-art terrestrial applications but also an aquatic survey conducted from a floating rig. The surveys revealed substantial sub-surface heterogeneity of depositional materials in the streambed and riparian zone. Eight characteristic radar facies were identified through the floodplain and ground-truthed against core samples and exposures of bank deposits. The majority of GPR profiles were dominated by trough-shaped depositional elements with erosional, curved, concave upward bounding surfaces, indicative of abandoned and chute stream channel structures. The identified abandoned channel structure was found to extend into the riverbed and to be filled by suspension fall-out fine-grained deposits (mud with organic matter and interbedded clay as indicated by observed signal attenuations). GPR proved to be a successful method to identify the spatial patterns of low conductivity peat and clay structures in the streambed and riparian zone of the investigated meander bend, highlighting its potential for larger scale analysis of these structures that have shown to control the exchange flow patterns between groundwater and surface water in lowland rivers.

49,49,"Cooper, JR",Apr 2018 ,Does the permeability of gravel river beds affect near-bed hydrodynamics?,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"The permeability of river beds is an important control on hyporheic flow and the movement of fine sediment and solutes into and out of the bed. However, relatively little is known about the effect of bed permeability on overlying near-bed flow dynamics, and thus on fluid advection at the sediment-water interface. This study provides the first quantification of this effect for water-worked gravel beds. Laboratory experiments in a recirculating flume revealed that flows over permeable beds exhibit fundamental differences compared with flows over impermeable beds of the same topography. The turbulence over permeable beds is less intense, more organised and more efficient at momentum transfer because eddies are more coherent. Furthermore, turbulent kinetic energy is lower, meaning that less energy is extracted from the mean flow by this turbulence. Consequently, the double-averaged velocity is higher and the bulk flow resistance is lower over permeable beds, and there is a difference in how momentum is conveyed from the overlying flow to the bed surface. The main implications of these results are three-fold. First, local pressure gradients, and therefore rates of material transport, across the sediment-water interface are likely to differ between impermeable and permeable beds. Second, near-bed and hyporheic flows are unlikely to be adequately predicted by numerical models that represent the bed as an impermeable boundary. Third, more sophisticated flow resistance models are required for coarse-grained rivers that consider not only the bed surface but also the underlying permeable structure. Overall, our results suggest that the effects of bed permeability have critical implications for hyporheic exchange, fluvial sediment dynamics and benthic habitat availability. (c) 2017 The Authors.
