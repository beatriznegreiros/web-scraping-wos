0,0,"Gooseff, MN",Jan 15 2017 ,Hydrologic connectivity and implications for ecosystem processes - Lessons from naked watersheds,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Hydrologic connectivity has received great attention recently as our conceptual models of watersheds and water quality have evolved in the past several decades. However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

1,1,"Peralta-Maraver, I",Jan 1 2018 ,"Interplay of hydrology, community ecology and pollutant attenuation in the hyporheic zone",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"We describe the hierarchical interplay of hydrology, hyporheic ecology and transformation of nutrients and pollutants in the hyporheic zone (HZ). The exchange of water between the surface-subsurface generates the hyporheic exchange flow: the engine that drives the ecological functioning of the HZ. The magnitude and direction of hydrological fluxes in theHZ followcomplex spatial patterns, strongly influenced by the temporal dynamics of surface flow in rivers.The direction and magnitude of hydrological fluxes also shapes the structure of hyporheic communities (hyporheos). During surface disturbances such as flooding or drought, benthic organisms may also use the HZ as a refuge, although the importance of this role is debated.Streambed organisms differ in their ability to colonize the HZ depending on the biological traits they possess. The reduction in oxygen concentration and pore size with increasing sediment depth imposes a limit on the distribution of macroinvertebrates, which are replaced by a suite of smaller organisms (meiofauna and protists) at deeper sediment layers. Therefore, a concomitant reduction in net biomass and productivity might be expected through depth. However, only a few studies have assessed the contribution of the hyporheos to whole system production, and they have focused only on the fraction of relatively large organisms.The bioreactor ability of the HZ to transform nutrients and pollutants is an important ecosystem service sustained by the life activities of hyporheos. Biofilms have the key role in this process due to their capacity to metabolize a wide range of dissolved compounds, including emerging pollutants. However, the residence time of water in pore sediments (resulting from hyporheic exchange flow) and the rest of the community (constantly reworking the sediments and grazing biofilms) are indirectly involved.

2,2,"Ruehl, CR",Jun 2007 ,"Nitrate dynamics within the Pajaro River, a nutrient-rich, losing stream",JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The major ion chemistry of water from an 11.42-km reach of the Pajaro River, a losing stream in central coastal California, shows a consistent pattern of higher concentrations during the 2(nd) (dry) half of the water year. Most solutes are conserved during flow along the reach, but [NO3-] decreases by similar to 30% and is accompanied by net loss of channel discharge and extensive surface-subsurface exchange. The corresponding net NO3- uptake length is 37 +/- 13 km (42 +/- 12 km when normalized to the conservative solute Cl-), and the areal NO3- uptake rate is 0.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The observed reduction in [NO3-] along the reach results from one or more internal sinks, not dilution by ground water, hill-slope water, or other water inputs. Observed reductions in [NO3-] and channel discharge along the experimental reach result in a net loss of 200-400 kg/d of NO3--N, similar to 50% of the input load. High-resolution (temporal and spatial) sampling indicates that most of the NO3- loss occurs along the lower part of the reach, where there is the greatest seepage loss and surface-subsurface exchange of water. Stable isotopes of NO3-, total dissolved P concentrations, and streambed chemical profiles suggest that denitrification is the most significant NO(3)(-)sink along the reach. Denitrification efficiency, as expressed through downstream enrichment in N-15-NO3-, varies considerably during the water year. When discharge is greater (typically earlier in the water year), denitrification is least efficient and downstream enrichment in N-15-NO3- is greatest. When discharge is lower, denitrification in the streambed appears to occur with greater efficiency, resulting in lower downstream enrichment in N-15-NO3-Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000246417700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNitrate%2Bdynamics%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2BPajaro%2BRiver%252C%2Ba%2Bnutrient-rich%252C%2Blosing%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DChristopher%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DCR%26rft.aulast%3DRuehl%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F0887-3593%25282007%252926%255B191%253ANDWTPR%255D2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D206%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D191-206%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D191%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D26%26rft.au%3DRuehl%252C%2BCR%26rft.au%3DFisher%252C%2BAT%26rft.au%3DShennan%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1899/0887-3593(2007)26[191:NDWTPR]2.0.CO;2,"rivers,solute transport,denitrification,N-15/N-14,O-18/O-16","HYPORHEIC ZONE,ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION,TRANSIENT STORAGE,NITROGEN BUDGET,DENITRIFICATION,RETENTION,RIPARIAN,OXYGEN,GROUNDWATER,TRANSPORT",,"Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Earth & Planetary Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA"
3,3,"Zhu, HY",Dec 2019 ,Nitrogen cycles within the stream-to-riparian continuum under flood waves,EPISODES,"By using a 2D-coupled flow and solute transport and reaction model across the stream-to-riparian continuum, this paper systematically studied the nitrogen-cycling processes driven by a flood wave and their spatial-temporal distributions. The influences on hyporheic nitrogen removal of different waves that vary by amplitude (A), duration (T), wave-type parameter (r) and rising duration (t(p)) were investigated. During the surface-water-infiltration period, the aerobic respiration, nitrification and denitrification in the hyporheic zone were gradually enhanced, and aerobic respiration was dominant. During the groundwater-backflow period, the reactions gradually weakened, and the role of denitrification was improved. The consumption of each solute continuously increased in the whole process, and the groundwater-backflow period corresponded to a larger consumption but at a smaller consumption rate. The reaction rates in space from high to low were as follows: riparian phreatic zone > variable saturated zone > stream bed. Hyporheic nitrogen removal increased with increasing A, T and t(p )and with decreasing]; which was contrary to the change rule of nitrogen removal efficiency. The hyporheic nitrogen removal exhibited a good linear relationship with the polynomial 'A*T*t(p)/r which had great predictive significance.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000501533900006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNitrogen%2Bcycles%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Bstream-to-riparian%2Bcontinuum%2Bunder%2Bflood%2Bwaves%26rft.aufirst%3DHaoyu%26rft.auinit%3DHY%26rft.aulast%3DZhu%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.18814%252Fepiiugs%252F2019%252F019027%26rft.epage%3D341%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0705-3797%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DEPISODES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D333-341%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D333%26rft.stitle%3DEPISODES%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DZhu%252C%2BHY%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BDS%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BQW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=EPISODES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.18814/epiiugs/2019/019027,,"HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,WATER INFILTRATION,NUTRIENT,RIVER,DENITRIFICATION,TRANSPORT,ZONE,DISPERSIVITY,INTERFACE,DISCHARGE",,"Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
4,4,"Moldovan, OT",Jan 2013 ,A simple method for assessing biotic indicators and predicting biodiversity in the hyporheic zone of a river polluted with metals,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The task of designating biotic indicators for the assessment of the ecological status of freshwater environments is difficult. The purpose of this study was to develop a method that uses different ecological categories of Crustacea from the hyporheic zone of the Aries River (north-western Romania) to monitor water and sediment quality. Samples of fauna, water and sediments were collected monthly during one year and classification and regression tree analysis was employed to identify bioindicator species and predict the effects of metal pollution on species diversity. For almost all dissolved metals and those partitioned into sediments in the hyporheic zone, microcrustaceans were good indicators of pollution, as they were absent in samples where concentrations of these elements were high. Most macrocrustaceans were good indicators only for high concentrations of Cu and Zn in water, and only one macrocrustaceans, Niphargus transylvanicus, could be considered as good indicator for sediment metal pollution. Hyporheic microcrustaceans such as Elaphoidella elaphoides, and representatives of Acanthocyclops and Bryocamptus cuspidatus should be used in future hyporheic zone quality assessments. The statistical method described by this study can also be applied for communities in surface habitats and for other types of pollutants. Typical hyporheos species can successfully indicate past or discontinuous pollution episodes and river basin managements should consider their use together with the benthic species to monitor water quality.

5,5,"Han, BS",Feb 2014 ,Detailed river stage mapping and head gradient analysis during meander cutoff in a laboratory river,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Analytical models of river evolution predict meander narrowing and elongation which creates sinuosity-driven hyporheic exchange across the meander neck, by decreasing flow distance and increasing head loss. We used a laboratory river table and close range photogrammetry to map and analyze sinuosity as a driver of head gradients and hyporheic exchange during cutoff. The river valley had relatively high slopes (1.8%) and moderately cohesive sediment (10% talc, 90% sand) to facilitate cutoff, and ratios of horizontal to vertical scaling were distorted to achieve dynamic similitude (Re=3200). Incipient to cutoff, the head gradient across the neck increased due to a narrowing neck, upstream aggradation, and downstream degradation. Longitudinal and transverse river surface slopes around the meander bend increased as the meander approached cutoff. The steep head gradient across the moderately cohesive meander neck generated seepage erosion and scour that formed a low-sinuosity avulsion. Sediment-rich flow in the avulsed channel aggraded the downstream bed and separated the active channel and oxbow lake. The limitation in geometric and dynamic similitude in the river table limits extrapolation to natural rivers, yet river evolution may involve aggradation and degradation induced channel head loss and turnover hyporheic exchange as well as seepage-induced meander neck erosion. Our submillimeter maps of meander morphology and water stage provide data to parameterize river evolution and hyporheic exchange models, and may inform analysis and mapping of field sites.Key Points Novel method to create free water surface maps along laboratory meander Laboratory meander evolves through neck cutoff and free water surface change Meander evolution triggers cycle of hydraulic gradient and hyporheic flux changeShow less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000333563900051,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDetailed%2Briver%2Bstage%2Bmapping%2Band%2Bhead%2Bgradient%2Banalysis%2Bduring%2Bmeander%2Bcutoff%2Bin%2Ba%2Blaboratory%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DBangshuai%26rft.auinit%3DBS%26rft.aulast%3DHan%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR013580%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1703%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1689-1703%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1689%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DHan%252C%2BBS%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BTA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR013580,"meander,neck cutoff,water surface elevation,piezometric head gradient,oxbow lake,close range photogrammetry,seepage erosion","PORE-WATER PRESSURE,SURFACE-WATER,CHANNEL PATTERNS,GROUNDWATER,FLOW,MORPHOLOGY,EXCHANGE,EROSION,MODEL,USA",,"Boise State Univ, Dept Geosci, Boise, ID 83725 USA"
6,6,"Monofy, A",Jan 2021 ,"The Effect of Streamflow, Ambient Groundwater, and Sediment Anisotropy on Hyporheic Zone Characteristics in Alternate Bars",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic exchange is the main driver for the biogeochemical transformations of nutrients within a river bed. The current study addresses the variations in hyporheic zone (HZ) characteristics in alternate bars due to different streamflow, ambient groundwater, and sediment anisotropy. Several simulations, using a sequentially coupled surface water-groundwater model of a synthetic reach with fully developed alternate bars morphology, were performed. Two HZs exist within the streambed; a shallow zone that is more linked to surface water, and a deep one that is more influenced by the groundwater variations. Increasing streamflow, and therefore bar submergence, decreases the hyporheic flow. The residence times distribution is bimodal, which implies the existence of two HZs. This bimodality is enhanced by anisotropic sediment conditions, while it is much milder in isotropic ones. The shallow zone residence times increase when streamflow value rises, while the residence times in the deep HZ are less affected. The mean and median residence times decrease by increasing streamflow in partially submerged case, and they are larger in fully submerged case. The hyporheic flow, area, residence times, and extent decrease by increasing groundwater fluxes. The deep zone is the most affected by the groundwater fluxes. Hyporheic flow and extent values are significantly larger in isotropic conditions than in anisotropic ones. The change in residence times values is different between the deep and shallow zones. A predictive model is driven to predict the hyporheic flux, residence times, and hyporheic depths dependence on bar submergence, ambient groundwater, and sediment anisotropy.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000618001100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR025069%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BEffect%2Bof%2BStreamflow%252C%2BAmbient%2BGroundwater%252C%2Band%2BSediment%2BAnisotropy%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BCharacteristics%2Bin%2BAlternate%2BBars%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMonofy%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025069%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DMonofy%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBoano%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR025069,,WATER,,"Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn, Turin, Italy"
7,7,"Ravazzani, G",Jun 2016 ,Assessing Groundwater Contribution to Streamflow of a Large Alpine River with Heat Tracer Methods and Hydrological Modelling,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The contribution of groundwater to streamflow in Alpine catchments is still poorly understood, despite the fact that it may heavily impact hydrological balance and stream habitats. This paper presents the results of a field campaign based on experiments with heat tracer methods to assess the hyporheic flow during the low-flow period of a large Alpine river in Italy. These measurements were employed to validate a distributed hydrological model that can be used to asses river-groundwater interaction in both low-flow and high-flow conditions. The results show that groundwater may have a relevant role during low-flow periods, by increasing river discharge and during floods, by subtracting direct run-off that is stored in river banks.

The purpose of the project is to restore local streams in Incheon for improvement of ecological restoration, water quality, flood prevention, and waterfront amenities for local residents. The project epitomizes the ethos of river governance through accommodation of views from various stakeholders, such as the government, nongovernmental organizations, local residents, and experts through establishment of the Stream Restoration Propulsion Group (SRPG). The enactment of the Special Ordinance for the SRPG has served to help the governance system work in the project. The interim assessment of the project in terms of river governance and ecological restoration indicates that the project has achieved a good degree of river governance coupled with a limited range of ecological restoration. The key to the success of the project hinges upon a continuous collaboration between the stakeholders to achieve river restoration, particularly political bargaining between the government and the other stakeholders.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000301847400007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGovernance%2Bin%2Ba%2BRiver%2BRestoration%2BProject%2Bin%2BSouth%2BKorea%253A%2BThe%2BCase%2Bof%2BIncheon%26rft.aufirst%3DSeungho%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DLee%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-011-9952-5%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1650%26rft.epage%3D1182%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1165-1182%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1165%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D26%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DChoi%252C%2BGW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11269-011-9952-5,"River governance,Incheon,South Korea,Stream restoration project,The Stream Restoration Propulsion Group,Stakeholder participation,Ecological restoration","MANAGEMENT,RESOURCES",,"Korea Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Anam Dong 5, Seoul 136701, South Korea"
9,9,"Masese, FO",Jan 2017 ,Influence of catchment land use and seasonality on dissolved organic matter composition and ecosystem metabolism in headwater streams of a Kenyan river,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Headwater streams influence the biogeochemical characteristics of large rivers and play important roles in regional and global carbon budgets. The combined effects of seasonality and land use change on the biogeochemistry of headwater streams, however, are not well understood. In this study we assessed the influence of catchment land use and seasonality on the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and ecosystem metabolism in headwater streams of a Kenyan river. Fifty sites in 34 streams draining a gradient of catchment land use from 100% natural forest to 100% agriculture were sampled to determine temporal and spatial variation in DOM composition. Gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) were determined in 10 streams draining primarily forest or agricultural catchments. Absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometry of DOM reflected notable shifts in composition along the land use gradient and with season. During the dry season, forest streams contained higher molecular weight and terrestrially derived DOM, whereas agricultural streams were dominated by autochthonous production and low molecular weight DOM. During the rainy season, aromaticity and high molecular weight DOM increased in agricultural streams, coinciding with seasonal erosion of soils and inputs of organic matter from farmlands. Most of the streams were heterotrophic. However, GPP and ER were generally greater in agricultural streams, driven by higher dissolved nutrient (mainly TDN) concentrations, light availability (open canopy) and temperature compared with forest streams. There were correlations between freshly and autochthonously produced DOM, GPP and ER during both the dry and wet seasons. This is one of the few studies to link land-use with organic carbon dynamics and DOM composition. Measures of ecosystem metabolism in these streams help to affirm the role of tropical streams and rivers as important components of the global carbon cycle and demonstrate that even semi-intensive, smallholder agriculture can have measurable effects on riverine ecosystem functioning.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394351700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bcatchment%2Bland%2Buse%2Band%2Bseasonality%2Bon%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bcomposition%2Band%2Becosystem%2Bmetabolism%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%2Bof%2Ba%2BKenyan%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DFrank%2BO.%26rft.auinit%3DFO%26rft.aulast%3DMasese%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-016-0269-6%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D22%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D1-2%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1-22%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D132%26rft.au%3DMasese%252C%2BFO%26rft.au%3DSalcedo-Borda%252C%2BJS%26rft.au%3DMcClain%252C%2BME&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10533-016-0269-6,"Carbon cycling,DOM composition,Land use change,Whole-stream metabolism,Tropical streams","OXYGEN CHANGE TECHNIQUE,FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS,MARA RIVER,FUNCTIONAL INDICATORS,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,LEAF DECOMPOSITION,GAS-EXCHANGE,CARBON,DYNAMICS,IMPACTS",,"Univ Eldoret, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Eldoret, Kenya"

Observations collected over 4 weeks reveal significant cross-shelf exchange (up to 0.5 Sv) at the shoreward edge of the Gulf Stream, which was 2 orders of magnitude larger than estimates from long-term mean hydrographic conditions. Gulf Stream frontal eddies may have contributed to some of the largest fluxes of heat (0.5 degrees C Sv) and salt (0.03 Sv g/kg) onto the shelf. We estimate that the largest upwelling event during the mission could have brought nitrate concentrations over 20 pM to within 125 m of the surface.

11,11,"Kulessa, B",Aug 15 2003 ,Cross-coupled flow modeling of coincident streaming and electrochemical potentials and application to subglacial self-potential data,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH,"This study aims to demonstrate that self-potential measurements can yield unique information about subglacial drainage conditions, which has so far been doubtful. At the bed of warm-based glaciers arborescent and distributed drainage systems interact, and streaming and electrochemical potentials coincide. A key secondary aim of this study is, therefore, the development of a mathematical framework for the analysis of self-potentials generated by such interacting flow systems. We consider cross coupling between hydraulic, electrical, and chemical driving forces, and apply the resulting model solution to self-potential data recorded beneath Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland. We find that (1) the streaming and electrochemical contributions to the total self-potential signal can be separated mathematically, (2) streaming potentials directly reflect the direction of water flow at the glacier bed, (3) combination of streaming potentials with hydraulic conductivity estimates from slug tests allows estimation of in situ subglacial water flow velocities, (4) the subglacial zeta potential, calculated from estimated values of the streaming coupling coefficient, is small (similar to-0.022 V) due to systematic flushing of clay minerals from the channel area during the melt season, and (5) uncertainties in exact electrode location in the borehole are unlikely to produce self-potential noise. Self-potential measurements may therefore yield unique information about subglacial drainage conditions, and especially the direction and velocity of in situ subglacial water flow are difficult to obtain by other methods. We further anticipate that our mathematical framework will be applicable to other areas of subsurface hydrology, especially where spatially distributed seepage feeds preferential flow pathways.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000184869900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2381%26rft.atitle%3DCross-coupled%2Bflow%2Bmodeling%2Bof%2Bcoincident%2Bstreaming%2Band%2Belectrochemical%2Bpotentials%2Band%2Bapplication%2Bto%2Bsubglacial%2Bself-potential%2Bdata%26rft.aufirst%3DB%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DKulessa%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2001JB001167%26rft.eissn%3D2169-9356%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9313%26rft.issue%3DB8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-SOLID%2BEARTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-SOL%2BEA%26rft.volume%3D108%26rft.au%3DKulessa%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DHubbard%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DBrown%252C%2BGH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-SOLID+EARTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2001JB001167,"streaming potential,electrochemical potential,subglacial hydrology,cross-coupled flows,SP modeling","HAUT GLACIER DAROLLA,DRAINAGE,SWITZERLAND,ANOMALIES,EARTH,TOMOGRAPHY,HYDROLOGY,BOREHOLES,SYSTEMS",,"Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Civil Engn, David Keir Bldg,Stranmillis Rd, Belfast BT9 5AG, Antrim, North Ireland"
12,12,"Grant, EHC",Jun 2009 ,Salamander occupancy in headwater stream networks,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Stream ecosystems exhibit a highly consistent dendritic geometry in which linear habitat units intersect to create a hierarchical network of connected branches.2. Ecological and life history traits of species living in streams, such as the potential for overland movement, may interact with this architecture to shape patterns of occupancy and response to disturbance. Specifically, large-scale habitat alteration that fragments stream networks and reduces connectivity may reduce the probability a stream is occupied by sensitive species, such as stream salamanders.3. We collected habitat occupancy data on four species of stream salamanders in first-order (i.e. headwater) streams in undeveloped and urbanised regions of the eastern U.S.A. We then used an information-theoretic approach to test alternative models of salamander occupancy based on a priori predictions of the effects of network configuration, region and salamander life history.4. Across all four species, we found that streams connected to other first-order streams had higher occupancy than those flowing directly into larger streams and rivers. For three of the four species, occupancy was lower in the urbanised region than in the undeveloped region.5. These results demonstrate that the spatial configuration of stream networks within protected areas affects the occurrences of stream salamander species. We strongly encourage preservation of network connections between first-order streams in conservation planning and management decisions that may affect stream species.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000265934700017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSalamander%2Boccupancy%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstream%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DEvan%2BH.%2BCampbell%26rft.auinit%3DEHC%26rft.aulast%3DGrant%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2009.02166.x%26rft.epage%3D1378%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1370-1378%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1370%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DGrant%252C%2BEHC%26rft.au%3DGreen%252C%2BLE%26rft.au%3DLowe%252C%2BWH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02166.x,"dendritic ecological network,headwater stream,occupancy,protected areas,stream salamander","EURYCEA-BISLINEATA,POPULATION-DYNAMICS,2-LINED SALAMANDER,SITE-OCCUPANCY,CONNECTIVITY,DISPERSAL,SCALE,MOVEMENTS,SYSTEM",,"USGS Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, 12100 Beech Forest Rd, Laurel, MD 20708 USA"

The model incorporates a 3D hydrodynamic model (POMGL) and a 3D particle tracking model (Partic3D) for the far-field transport computations. The source conditions for the particle tracking model are obtained from a near-field model derived from the characteristics of the plume analyzed from extensive field studies on the Grand River plume, Lake Michigan. The empirical near-field model was developed to predict the geometry of the plume, dilution, and centerline trajectory near the river mouth, and to provide the concentration and location of the particles to be released in the far field. The coupled empirical-numerical model shows improved predictions in the near field versus the single numerical model. The present results strongly advocate the use of model combinations in order to improve coastal diffusion and transport processes.

Three study sites were established: (1) Aspen Creek, in a sandstone-siltstone catchment with a fine-grained alluvium of low hydraulic conductivity (1.3 x 10(-4) cm/s), (2) Rio Calaveras, which flows through volcanic tuff with alluvium of intermediate grain size and hydraulic conductivity (1.2 x 10(-3) cm/s), and (3) Gallina Creek, located in a granite/gneiss catchment of coarse, poorly sorted alluvium with high hydraulic conductivity (4.1 x 10(-3) cm/s). All sites were instrumented with networks of shallow groundwater wells to monitor interstitial solute transport. The rate and extent of groundwater-surface water exchange, determined by the solute response in wells, increased with increasing hydraulic conductivity. The direction of surface water-groundwater interaction within a stream was related to local variation in vertical and horizontal hydraulic gradients. Experimental tracer responses in the surface stream were simulated with a one-dimensional solute transport model with inflow and storage components (OTIS). Model-derived measures of hydrological retention showed a corresponding increase with increasing hydraulic conductivity.To assess the temporal variability of hydrological retention, solute injection experiments were conducted in Gallina Creek under four seasonal flow regimes during which surface discharge ranged from baseflow (0.75 l/s in October) to high (75 l/s during spring snowmelt). Model-derived hydrological retention decreased with increasing discharge.The results of our intersite comparison suggest that hydrological retention is strongly influenced by the geologic setting and alluvial characteristics of the stream catchment. Temporal variation in hydrological retention at Gallina Creek is related to seasonal changes in discharge, highlighting the need for temporal resolution in studies of the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in stream ecosystems.

Secondly, the index systems of river health assessment including river morphology, hydrological and environmental characteristics, habitat elements and human activity characteristics are determined. Thirdly, set-pair (SPA) evaluation theory and extension were dealt with, a set-pair analysis-extension coupling model is constructed. Finally, taking Huangchuan Rive as an example, the ecological health evaluation on the river channel is carried out by using set-pair analysis-extension coupling model. The results of the comprehensive evaluation using the set-pair analysis-extension coupling method is obtained through calculation. It is proved by practice that the method of river health evaluation using the coupling model of set-pair analysis and extension theory could make full use of the data transformation and extension calculation, which shows the superiority in calculating correlation degree, and could reflect the determination and uncertainty of practical problems.

16,16,"Uijttewaal, WSJ",Nov 2001 ,Exchange processes between a river and its groyne fields: Model experiments,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE,"The exchange of dissolved matter between a groyne field and a main stream influences the transport and distribution of a pollutant cloud in a river. In forecasting models, groyne fields are represented as dead zones with effective properties like exchange coefficients and exchanging volume. Despite its relevance for such practical applications, little research has been done on the exchange process between a groyne field and the main stream itself. Therefore, this study is aimed at examining this exchange process and validating the dead-zone prediction model, which treats the exchange process as a first order system. A schematized physical model of a river with groynes was built in a laboratory flume. The exchange process was visualized quantitatively with dye in, adjacent groyne fields. In order to couple the exchange process to the velocity field, particle tracking velocimetry measurements were performed. Two different types of exchange were observed. First, exchange takes place via the mixing layer that is formed at the river-groyne-field interface. The large eddies formed in the mixing layer are the major cause of this exchange. Second, under certain conditions, even larger eddies are shed from the upstream groyne tip. Distortions in the flow field caused by such intermittent structures cause a much larger exchange than that by the mixing layer alone. The occurrence of large shed eddies depends on the presence of a sufficiently large, stationary, secondary gyre located at the upstream corner of the groyne field. The overall exchange of matter could be characterized as a first-order process, in accordance with the dead-zone-theory. The corresponding exchange coefficients agreed reasonably well with the results of earlier experiments and the effective coefficients as found in experiments in real river flows.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000171756400005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExchange%2Bprocesses%2Bbetween%2Ba%2Briver%2Band%2Bits%2Bgroyne%2Bfields%253A%2BModel%2Bexperiments%26rft.aufirst%3DWSJ%26rft.auinit%3DWSJ%26rft.aulast%3DUijttewaal%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9429%25282001%2529127%253A11%2528928%2529%26rft.epage%3D936%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9429%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BENGINEERING-ASCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D928-936%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D928%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BENG-ASCE%26rft.volume%3D127%26rft.au%3DUijttewaal%252C%2BWSJ%26rft.au%3DLehmann%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3Dvan%2BMazijk%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+ENGINEERING-ASCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2001)127:11(928),,"SHALLOW-WATER FLOW,RECIRCULATING FLOW,MIXING LAYERS,TURBULENT,FRICTION",,"Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Hyrol & Ecol Sect, Delft, Netherlands"
17,17,"Liu, X",Dec 2019 ,One-Dimensional/Two-Dimensional Coupling Approach with Quadrilateral Confluence Region for Modeling River Systems,JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING,"We study shallow water flows in river systems. An accurate description of such flows can be obtained using the two-dimensional (2-D) shallow water equations, which can be numerically solved by a shock-capturing finite-volume method. This approach can, however, be inefficient and computationally unaffordable when a large river system with many tributaries and complex geometry is to be modeled. A popular simplified approach is to model flow in each uninterrupted section of the river (called a reach) as one-dimensional (1-D) and connect the reaches at the river junctions. The flow in every reach can then be modeled using the 1-D shallow water equations, whose numerical solution is dramatically less computationally expensive compared with solving its 2-D counterpart. Even though several point-junction models are available, most of them prove to be sufficiently accurate only in the case of a smooth flow though the junction. We propose a new 1-D/2-D river junction model, in which each reach of the river is modeled by the 1-D shallow water equations, while the confluence region, where the mixing of flows from the different directions occurs, is modeled by the 2-D ones. We define the confluence region to be a trapezoid with parallel vertical sides. This allows us to take into account both the average width of each reach and the angle between the directions of flow of the tributary and the principal river at the confluence. We choose a trapezoidal confluence region as it is consistent with the 1-D model of the river. We implement well-balanced positivity preserving second-order semi-discrete central-upwind schemes developed in Kurganov and Petrova (Commun Math Sci 5:133-160, 2007) for the 1-D shallow water equations and in Shirkhani et al. (Comput Fluids 126: 25-40, 2016) for the 2-D shallow water equations using quadrilateral grids. For the 2-D junction simulations in the confluence region we choose a very coarse 2-D mesh as the goal of our model is not to resolve the fine details of complex 2-D vortices that form around the junction, but to efficiently compute average water depth and velocity in the connected 1-D reaches. A special ghost cell technique is developed for coupling the reaches to the confluence region, which is one of the most important parts of a good 1-D/2-D coupling method. The proposed approach leads to very significant computational savings compared to numerically solving the full 2-D problem. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate plausibility of the proposed 1-D/2-D coupling model.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000501505900009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOne-Dimensional%252FTwo-Dimensional%2BCoupling%2BApproach%2Bwith%2BQuadrilateral%2BConfluence%2BRegion%2Bfor%2BModeling%2BRiver%2BSystems%26rft.aufirst%3DXin%26rft.auinit%3DX%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10915-019-00985-4%26rft.eissn%3D1573-7691%26rft.epage%3D1328%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-7474%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BSCIENTIFIC%2BCOMPUTING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1297-1328%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1297%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BSCI%2BCOMPUT%26rft.volume%3D81%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DChertock%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DWolfkill%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+SCIENTIFIC+COMPUTING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10915-019-00985-4,"Shallow water flow in river systems,One-dimensional,two-dimensional coupling,Quadrilateral confluence region,Well-balanced central-upwind scheme","CENTRAL-UPWIND SCHEME,SHALLOW-WATER EQUATIONS,TRIANGULAR GRIDS,SIMULATION,1D",,"North Carolina State Univ, Dept Math, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA"

Hydraulic exchange at a riffle-pool sequence in the Lahn River, Germany, was analyzed using HEC-RAS to simulate the surface water flow as a boundary for the subsurface flow and MODFLOW, MODPATH, and MT3DMS to reproduce the transport in the subsurface. Solute transport and residence times of surface water in the subsurface were simulated after calibrating sediment properties to fit simulated hydraulic head to measured subsurface head from the riffle-pool pair. Three surface water flow rates were considered. Results indicated that exchange increases with increasing surface water flow. However, the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed sediments influences the mass transfer more than the surface water flow. The ratio of the infiltration rate to the surface water flow is of the same order of magnitude for all the considered flow conditions. Residence times of surface water in the subsurface varied inversely with the flow rates in the river.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000234370200003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW12424%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bnumerical%2Bstudy%2Bof%2Bsurface-subsurface%2Bexchange%2Bprocesses%2Bat%2Ba%2Briffle-pool%2Bpair%2Bin%2Bthe%2BLahn%2BRiver%252C%2BGermany%26rft.aufirst%3DN%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DSaenger%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2004WR003875%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DSaenger%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DKitanidis%252C%2BPK%26rft.au%3DStreet%252C%2BRL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2004WR003875,,"HYPORHEIC ZONE,BED FORMS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,WATER EXCHANGE,STREAM,FLOW,ECOLOGY,MODEL",,"Tech Univ Darmstadt, Inst Water Engn, Rundeturmstr 1, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany"
19,19,"Hester, ET",Dec 1 2020 ,"Abundance, distribution, and geometry of naturally occurring streambank soil pipes",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The near-stream groundwater environment is a unique ecotone composed of the hyporheic zone and riparian/floodplain groundwater. Preferential flow paths through sediments are areas of substantially higher permeability than surrounding media. Macropores and soil pipes are a type of preferential flow path where conduit-like voids occur in soil as a result of biological and physical processes. Recent papers show that soil pipes exist in streambanks and have the potential to enhance the exchange of water and solutes between the channel and riparian groundwater. However, these prior streambank studies were confined to isolated locations, hence we do not know if streambank soil pipes are a limited or widespread phenomenon. Here we quantified the abundance, distribution, and geometry of naturally occurring streambank soil pipes >1.0 cm in diameter in 20 streams across 5 physiographic provinces in the eastern United States. We found 998 streambank soil pipes across all 20 streams, demonstrating their ubiquity in the region. Pipe openings were, on average, 4.0 cm wide, 3.4 cm high, spaced 2.2 m apart, and 26.0 cm above baseflow water surface elevation (WSEL) in the channel. Most pipes were above baseflow WSEL, with only 5.7% below. Pipes were more abundant in fine-grained soils, which generally have higher cohesivity and lower hydraulic conductivity. Soil pipes were more abundant in 3 of the 5 physiographic provinces, likely because of greater presence of fine-grained soils. At a smaller scale, streambanks with greater longitudinal heterogeneity of soil texture often had greater spatial heterogeneity of pipe density. However, given the effort required to characterize a relatively small number of streams, and because stream order and soil texture are related to physiographic province, it was not possible to statistically test the effect of these factors. This work represents the first attempt to characterize streambank soil pipe abundance and distribution across a range of stream orders and physiographic provinces. The ubiquity of soil pipes in the region implies their effect on bidirectional hyporheic exchange is likely equally widespread. These results may have water-quality implications, where streambank soil pipes could enhance hyporheic exchange but reduce the filtering capacity of riparian buffer zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000577955500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAbundance%252C%2Bdistribution%252C%2Band%2Bgeometry%2Bof%2Bnaturally%2Boccurring%2Bstreambank%2Bsoil%2Bpipes%26rft.aufirst%3DErich%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F711655%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D751%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D735-751%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D735%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DMcEwen%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DRost%252C%2BEA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/711655,"preferential flow,surface water-groundwater interaction,hydraulic conductivity,hyporheic zone,hyporheic exchange,floodplain,riparian zone","SCALE HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,ATLANTIC COASTAL-PLAIN,INSTREAM RESTORATION,INSET FLOODPLAINS,INTERNAL EROSION,RIPARIAN ZONE,FLOW,WATER,TRANSPORT,MACROPORES",,"Virginia Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 200 Patton Hall,750 Drillfield Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
20,20,"Ashworth, PJ",Aug 2012 ,How do big rivers come to be different?,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,"Big rivers dominate the world's continental surface, yet we are still learning about how they operate and whether they are explicably different, not only from each other, but also from smaller rivers. This paper uses global satellite imagery and ground field-experience to explain and illustrate why and how big rivers are strongly differentiated.At the largest scale, trans-continent sized rivers do not possess unified valley systems created by fluvial erosion but instead involve chains of interlinked domains with contrasted fluvial functions. Alluvial settings are dependent on mainstream and tributary inputs of water and sediment but big river channel pattern variety is determined by contrasts in sediment feed-rates and differences in the rates and routes of sediment exchange. Four modes of alluvial exchange are recognised: (i) deposition on the floodplain (e.g., levees, infilled palaeochannels and floodbasins), (ii) exchanges involving main channels (e.g., bank erosion and accretion), (iii) deposition within main channels (e.g. bedforms from metres to 10s of kilometres in size), and (iv) material input from tributaries (sediment-rich or sediment-poor). Different combinations of sedimentation activity lead to floodplain morphologies for big rivers that can be classified into four types: (i) lacustrine-dominated, (ii) mainstream-dominated, (iii) tributary or accessory-stream dominated, and (iv) confined or bedrock-dominated.Channel patterning involves a range of main-channel, branch and floodplain styles promoted by variable sediment feeds, complex bed sediment transfers, variable lateral sediment exchanges, plural channel systems and incomplete mineral sedimentation of the hydraulic corridors set by tectonics and prior-valley trenching. In some of the world's largest rivers it is accessory and tributary channels, rather than main-river branches, which determine patterns of floodplain morphology. In some big rivers, but certainly not all, ponded lacustrine environments are common, with water bodies that vary from smaller water-filled swales and palaeochannels, to floodbasins and km-scale linear lakes in sediment-dammed tributaries. Organic sedimentation is significant along relatively sediment-poor and laterally-stable large rivers that fail to fill their alluvial corridors. Three case studies are used to illustrate this variability in big river pattern and process: the Ob, Jamuna and Parana. These rivers are respectively dominated by meandering, braiding and mixed mainstream and accessory channel morphologies.Big rivers have some processes and patterns that are different from smaller rivers including: (i) no simple down-valley sequence in control variables and channel pattern, (ii) main channels with high width:depth ratios. (iii) few or no channel-wide unit bars migrating through the main thalwegs, (iv) extensive and low-gradient floodplains that provide space for channel shifting and floodplain sedimentation, (v) long distances between significant tributaries to allow full mixing of water and sediment discharges, (vi) in some places, partially-decoupled channels and floodplains, and (vii) significant floodplain water bodies that readily act as sinks for fine-grained sediment where this is supplied, or organic deposition.Although understanding of contemporary big river patterns requires attention to a range of timescales, including inheritance from sediments of Quaternary age. big rivers do have a distinctive character. The variety of patterns on big rivers may usefully be viewed in terms of sediment systems operating at both the catchment and reach scales. Intra-river variability and internal complexity show the need to understand contrasted sediment supply, through-put and alluvial exchange as determinants of big river morphology and pattern.

An injection of SF6 into the river to estimate the gas transfer velocity assisted in constraining the model. Previous estimates of groundwater inflow using Rn-222 activities have not considered possible input of radon due to exchange between river water and water in the hyporheic zone beneath the streambed. In this paper, radon input due to hyporheic exchange is estimated from measurements of radon production by hyporheic zone sediments and rates of water exchange between the river and the hyporheic zone. Total groundwater inflow to the Cockburn River is estimated to be 18500 m(3)/d, although failure to consider hyporheic exchange would cause overestimation of the volume of groundwater inflow by approximately 70%.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000241303300005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW10411%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bgroundwater%2Bdischarge%2Bto%2BCockburn%2BRiver%252C%2Bsoutheastern%2BAustralia%252C%2Busing%2Bdissolved%2Bgas%2Btracers%2BRn-222%2Band%2BSF6%26rft.aufirst%3DP.%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DPG%26rft.aulast%3DCook%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2006WR004921%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DCook%252C%2BPG%26rft.au%3DLamontagne%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DClark%252C%2BJF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2006WR004921,,"CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,WATER EXCHANGE,STREAM,SEDIMENT,RADON,FLOW,MODEL,RATES",,"CSIRO Land & Water, Waite Rd, Urrbrae, SA 5064, Australia"
22,22,"Harvey, JW",Sep 2003 ,Predicting changes in hydrologic retention in an evolving semi-arid alluvial stream,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Hydrologic retention of solutes in hyporheic zones or other slowly moving waters of natural channels is thought to be a significant control on biogeochemical cycling and ecology of streams. To learn more about factors affecting hydrologic retention, we repeated stream-tracer injections for 5 years in a semi-arid alluvial stream (Pinal Creek, Ariz.) during a period when streamflow was decreasing, channel width increasing, and coverage of aquatic macrophytes expanding. Average stream velocity at Pinal Creek decreased from 0.8 to 0.2 m/s, average stream depth decreased from 0.09 to 0.04 m, and average channel width expanded from 3 to 13 in. Modeling of tracer experiments indicated that the hydrologic retention factor (R-h), a measure of the average time that solute spends in storage per unit length of downstream transport, increased from 0.02 to 8 s/m. At the same time the ratio of cross-sectional area of storage zones to main channel cross-sectional area (A(s)/A) increased from 0.2 to 0.8 m(2)/m(2) and average water residence time in storage zones (t(s)) increased from 5 to 24 min. Compared with published data from four other streams in the US, Pinal Creek experienced the greatest change in hydrologic retention for a given change in streamflow. The other streams differed from Pinal Creek in that they experienced a change in streamflow between tracer experiments without substantial geomorphic or vegetative adjustments. As a result, a regression of hydrologic retention on streamflow developed for the other streams underpredicted the measured increases in hydrologic retention at Pinal Creek. The increase in hydrologic retention at Pinal Creek was more accurately predicted when measurements of the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor were used (either alone or in addition to streamflow) as a predictor variable. We conclude that relatively simple measurements of channel friction are useful for predicting the response of hydrologic retention in streams to major adjustments in channel morphology as well as changes in streamflow.

23,23,"Morales-Hernandez, M",Feb 1 2016 ,Conservative 1D-2D coupled numerical strategies applied to river flooding: The Tiber (Rome),APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING,"Coupled 1D-2D numerical strategies are presented in this work for their application to fast computation of large rivers flooding. Both 1D and 2D models are built using explicit upwind finite volume schemes, able to deal with wetting-drying fronts. The topography representation is described via cross sections for the 1D model and with quadrilateral/triangular structured/unstructured meshes for the 2D model. The coupling strategies, free of hydraulic structures and tuning parameters, are firstly validated in a laboratory test dealing with a levee break and its flooding into a lateral plane. The numerical results are compared with a fully 2D model as well as with measurements in some gauge points giving satisfactory results. The simulation of a real flooding scenario in the Tiber river near the urban area of Rome (Italy) is then performed. A lateral coupling configuration is provided, in which the flood wave propagation in the main channel is simulated by means of a 1D model and the inundation of the riverside is simulated by means of a 2D model. On the other hand, a frontal coupling, in which the flood wave is simulated in a 1D model first and then it is propagated into a 2D model, is also performed. The flooding extension is almost well captured by all the schemes presented, being the 1D-2D lateral configuration the most confident with speed-ups of around 15x. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

24,24,"Bao, J",Nov 15 2018 ,Modulating factors of hydrologic exchanges in a large-scale river reach: Insights from three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hydrologic exchange is a critical mechanism that shapes hydrological and biogeochemical processes along a river corridor. Because of limitations in field accessibility, computational demand, and complexities of geomorphology and subsurface geology, full three-dimensional modelling studies to quantify hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) have been limited mostly to local-scale applications. At reach scales, although surface flow conditions and subsurface physical properties are well-known factors that modulate hydrologic exchanges, quantitative measures that can describe the effects of these factors on the strength and direction of such exchanges do not exist. To address this issue, we developed a one-way coupled surface and subsurface water flow model using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software STARCCM+ and applied it to simulate HEFs in a 7-km long reach along the main stem of the Columbia River in the United States. The model was validated against flow velocity measurements from an acoustic Doppler current profiler in the river, vertical HEFs estimated from a set of temperature profilers installed across the riverbed, and simulations from a reactive transport model. The validated model then was employed to systematically investigate how HEFs could be influenced by surface water fluid dynamics, subsurface structures, and hydrogeological properties. Our results suggest that reach-scale HEFs are dominated primarily by the thickness of the riverbed alluvium layer, and then by the alluvium permeability, the depth of the underlying impermeable layer, and the pressure boundary condition. Our results also elucidate the scale dependence of HEFs on fluid dynamics that can be captured only by three-dimensional CFD models. That is, while the net HEFs over the entire 7-km domain are not significantly influenced by surface water dynamics pressure, the dynamic pressure induced by fluid dynamics can lead to more than 15% in net HEFs for a river section of a few hundred metres.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000451786600002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModulating%2Bfactors%2Bof%2Bhydrologic%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge-scale%2Briver%2Breach%253A%2BInsights%2Bfrom%2Bthree-dimensional%2Bcomputational%2Bfluid%2Bdynamics%2Bsimulations%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DBao%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13266%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D3463%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D23%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3446-3463%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3446%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DBao%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DZachara%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.13266,"computational fluid dynamics (CFD),hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs),river corridors","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,FLOW,MODEL",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Washington, DC 99354 USA"

Its coupling system is composed of urbanization and eco-environment subsystems. In this paper, the coupling degree (CD) and the coupling coordinated degree (CCD) are used to reflect the coupling interaction and coupling coordination between the urbanization subsystem and the eco-environment subsystem. Based on the dynamic relative quantities of urbanization and eco-environment data in the Pearl River Delta, CD and CCD values were calculated, and the spatiotemporal evolution trend of coordination was analyzed. The results show that (1) from 2000 to 2015, the nine cities in the Pearl River Delta had high CD values and CCD values. Though they had different performances in different periods, they were all in a coordinated class, including good coordination (GC), moderate coordination (MC), and bare coordination (BC). (2) In terms of temporal evolution, the coupling coordination between urbanization and the eco-environment in the entire Pearl River Delta greatly improved. (3) From the perspective of spatial distribution, the coupling coordination of the central region was higher than that of the peripheral regions, and that of the west bank of the Pearl River was higher than that of the east bank of the Pearl River.

The modeling framework is novel in capturing the two-way coupling between evolving solute concentrations above and below the SWI and in allowing for a depth-varying diffusivity. Three diffusivity profiles within the sediment (constant, exponentially decaying, and a hybrid model) are evaluated against an extensive set of previously published laboratory measurements of turbulent mass transfer across the SWI. The exponential diffusivity profile best represents experimental observations and its reference diffusivity scales with the permeability Reynolds number, a dimensionless measure of turbulence at the SWI. The depth over which turbulence-enhanced diffusivity decays is of the order of centimeters and comparable to the thickness of the benthic biolayer. Thus, turbulent mixing across the SWI may serve as a universal transport mechanism, supplying the nutrient and energy fluxes needed to sustain microbial growth, and nutrient processing, in the benthic biolayer of stream and coastal sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000603660400019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR026822%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BOne-Dimensional%2BModel%2Bfor%2BTurbulent%2BMixing%2Bin%2Bthe%2BBenthic%2BBiolayer%2Bof%2BStream%2Band%2BCoastal%2BSediments%26rft.aufirst%3DStanley%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DGrant%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR026822%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DGrant%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR026822,"stream,turbulence,hyporheic,streambed,nutrient cycling,pollution","DISSOLVED-OXYGEN TRANSFER,HYPORHEIC-EXCHANGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSPORT,WATER,ZONE,FLOW,SURFACE,DENITRIFICATION,CONDUCTIVITY",,"Virginia Tech, Charles E Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Occoquan Watershed Monitoring Lab, Manassas, VA USA"

Subpolar water replaces the mixed water and resharpens the front. The water mass exchange accounts for a northward flux of salt of 0.5-2.5 psum(2)s(-1), (large-scale diffusivity O (100m(2)s(-1))). This is similar to bulk-scale flux estimates of 1.2psum(2)s(-1) and supplies fresher water to the Gulf Stream required for the production of 18 degrees subtropical mode water.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000372056600035,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSubmesoscale%2Bstreamers%2Bexchange%2Bwater%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bnorth%2Bwall%2Bof%2Bthe%2BGulf%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DJody%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DKlymak%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015GL067152%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D1233%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1226-1233%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1226%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DKlymak%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DShearman%252C%2BRK%26rft.au%3DMcWilliams%252C%2BJC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015GL067152,"ocean mixing,Gulf Stream,submesoscale mixing,eddies","SOUTHERN-OCEAN,TRAJECTORIES,TRANSPORT,SURFACE,WAVES,JETS",,"Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC, Canada"
28,28,"Faiz, MA",May 2018 ,"Stream flow variability and drought severity in the Songhua River Basin, Northeast China",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,"A slight variation in the magnitude of stream flow can have a substantial influence on the development of water resources. The Songhua River Basin (SRB) serves as a major grain commodity basin and is located in the northeastern region of China. Recent studies have identified a gradual decrease in stream flows, which presents a serious risk to water resources of the region. It is therefore necessary to assess the variation in stream flow and to predict the future of stream flows and droughts to make a comprehensive plan for agricultural irrigation. The simulation of monthly stream flows and the investigation of the influence of climate on the stream flow in the SRB were performed by utilizing the Integrated Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool coupled with observed precipitation data, as well as the Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE's Water Resources) precipitation product. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC) was used to assess the WEAP efficiency. During the time of calibration, NSC was obtained as 0.90 and 0.67 using observed and APHRODITE precipitation data, respectively. The results indicate that WEAP can be used effectively in the SRB. The application of the model suggested a maximum decline in stream flow, reaching 24% until the end of 21st century under future climate change scenarios. The drought indices (standardized drought index and percent of normal index) demonstrated that chances of severe to extreme drought events are highest in 2059, 2060 and 2085, while in the remaining time period mild to moderate drought events may occur in the entire study area.

29,29,"Ren, JH",May 15 2004 ,Modeling of simultaneous exchange of colloids and sorbing contaminants between streams and streambeds,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Contaminant transport in streams can be significantly modified by both stream-subsurface exchange and the presence of colloidal particles, but the interaction of these effects is not well understood. Exchange with the hyporheic zone exposes Contaminants to surface-chemical reactions with streambed sediments, while colloidal particles have a large reactive surface area that allows them to carry pollutants that would otherwise be transported primarily as dissolved species. A new theoretical model is developed to predict the role of colloids in mediating advective contaminant exchange between streams and streambeds. Bedform-induced pumping theory is applied to model physical transport, and colloid filtration and reversible contaminant sorption are used to calculate the local distributions of colloids and contaminants within the streambed. Residence time functions of both colloids and contaminants in the bed are then used to link contaminant concentrations in the pore water and streamwater. Model simulations indicate that, under conditions of low colloid filtration and strong contaminant sorption to colloids, contaminants are mobilized by colloids and there is less retention of contaminants in the streambed. This is the case of ""colloid-facilitated contaminant transport"" commonly considered in groundwater transport. On the other hand, when colloid filtration is high and contaminants still sorb strongly to colloids, contaminant mobility decreases and there is greater contaminant retention in the streambed. We term this case ""colloid-impeded contaminant transport"". Thus, we find that a variety of contaminant transport behavior can occur depending on the concentration and mobility of suspended particles in the system and the relative affinity of contaminants for colloids and other solid phases.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000221502800030,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bof%2Bsimultaneous%2Bexchange%2Bof%2Bcolloids%2Band%2Bsorbing%2Bcontaminants%2Bbetween%2Bstreams%2Band%2Bstreambeds%26rft.aufirst%3DJH%26rft.auinit%3DJH%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes034852l%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D2911%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2901-2911%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2901%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es034852l,,"REACTIVE SOLUTE TRANSPORT,ACID-MINE DRAINAGE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSIENT STORAGE,METAL TRANSPORT,BED,SAND,KAOLINITE",,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA"
30,30,"Dangeard, M",Oct 2021 ,River Corridor Model Constrained by Time-Lapse Seismic Acquisition,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"A new hydrogeophysical approach was developed to reveal the spatial and temporal dynamic flow pathways inside a river corridor as well as the pattern of transient surface water and the groundwater (SW-GW) exchanges. Obtaining such information from traditional hydrological data remains a challenge, both in terms of accuracy and validation. As there is no direct measurement of these fluxes, estimating dynamic pathways and SW-GW exchanges is frequently tackled with the help of numerical models. Yet, the definition of initial and boundary conditions is generally based on poorly constrained assumptions and restrained to the location of piezometers, due to the lack of knowledge of the water table (WT) geometry. We provide a methodology to build stronger constraints to the numerical simulation and the hydrodynamic parameters calibration, both in space and time, by using a multi-method approach. On the Orgeval Critical Zone observatory (France), we show how a thorough interpretation of high-resolution geophysical images, combined with geotechnical data, helps to resolve subsurface structural heterogeneity. This coupling provides a detailed distribution of hydrofacies, valuable prior information about the associated hydrodynamic properties distribution. The temporal dynamic of the WT table can be locally captured with high-resolution time-lapse seismic acquisitions. Time-lapse variations are interpreted as temporal changes in the saturated-unsaturated zone continuum. Each seismic snapshot is then thoroughly inverted to image spatial WT variations. This posterior geophysical information is then used to calibrate the hydrogeological modeling domain. The use of the WT improves the estimation of transient stream-aquifer exchanges, especially during the rain event.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000711970600042,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028911%26rft.atitle%3DRiver%2BCorridor%2BModel%2BConstrained%2Bby%2BTime-Lapse%2BSeismic%2BAcquisition%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DDangeard%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028911%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DDangeard%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DRiviere%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DMaineult%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR028911,"Water table geometry,Stream-aquifer exchanges,modeling,time-lapse,seismic,hydrogeophysics","SURFACE-WATER INTERACTIONS,REGIONAL GROUNDWATER-FLOW,LEAST-SQUARES INVERSION,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,NEIGHBORHOOD ALGORITHM,GEOPHYSICAL INVERSION,REFRACTION TOMOGRAPHY,AQUIFER EXCHANGE,SPATIAL-PATTERNS",,"PSL Univ, Mines ParisTech, Geosci Dept, Paris, France"

Results from a pilot study are presented for eight days during July, September, October and November 1994.Total energy gains were dominated by net short-wave radiation (97.60%) with significant contributions from sensible heat exchange and friction (1.17 and 1.06%, respectively) and minor additions from condensation and bed conduction (0.16 and 0.01%, respectively). Net long-wave radiation, evaporation, conduction into the river bed, sensible heat transfer and the energy advected during evaporation accounted for 53.98, 23.56, 16.27, 5.25 and 0.94% of the total heat losses. On average, over 82% of the total energy transfers occurred at the air-water interface. Approximately 15% of the total energy exchanges occurred at the channel bed, but maximum daily heat exchanges accounted for up to 24% of the daily total energy transfer. The amount of short-wave radiation attenuated in the water column, and values measured at the channel bed varied considerably from those calculated using a standard coefficient. Values of bed conduction varied in response to different vertical thermal profiles in the channel bed, reflecting the variable influence of sedimentology and groundwater flux. Fluctuations in levels of periphyton and macrophyte cover were also shown to have a significant effect on energy fluxes at the channel bed.

However, the flow regulation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in the middle Yangtze River has attracted much attention because the severe drought occurred in the river-lake system downstream of the TGR. In this paper, the Dongting Lake was selected as a case study in order to detect the possible relationship between the flow regulation of the TGR and the extreme drought in the river-lake system based on a coupled hydrodynamic model. The results not only confirmed the significant role of the TGR to relieve drought in the river-lake system, but also indicated that the outflow of the TGR and the hydraulic gradient between the Zhicheng to Chenglingji stations were the crucial factors to affect the water exchange between the rivers and the Dongting Lake. The adjustment of hydraulic gradient within a proper range during the water compensation of the TGR will be an effective measure to improve the water exchange and water environment in the river-lake system.

33,33,"Lusardi, RA",Oct 2018 ,Stream macrophytes increase invertebrate production and fish habitat utilization in a California stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Stable flow and thermal regimes, coupled with geologically derived nutrients, are drivers of enhanced productivity in volcanic spring-fed rivers. However, little information exists on biotic mechanisms or species interactions contributing to elevated productivity at higher trophic levels. In a California stream, juvenile steelhead trout were observed to preferentially select macrophyte habitat at a rate three times greater, on average, than five other habitat types. To understand the potential rearing benefits associated with macrophytes, we conducted a manipulative experiment to determine how macrophytes affect invertebrate prey availability and stream water velocity. Macrophytes supported up to nine times greater abundance of invertebrates than adjacent open gravel habitats. They also doubled invertebrate drift rates and reduced water velocity by up to 42-fold. The results show that aquatic macrophytes are an important stream habitat feature that may be bioenergetically more favourable for rearing salmonids than more traditional lotic habitats. We suggest that macrophytes have the potential to enhance growth rates of juvenile salmonids when compared with other habitat types. Habitats that confer growth and size advantages may ultimately improve fitness and contribute to conservation of imperilled salmonids.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000446330200012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStream%2Bmacrophytes%2Bincrease%2Binvertebrate%2Bproduction%2Band%2Bfish%2Bhabitat%2Butilization%2Bin%2Ba%2BCalifornia%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DRA%26rft.aulast%3DLusardi%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.3331%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D1012%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1003-1012%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1003%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DLusardi%252C%2BRA%26rft.au%3DJeffres%252C%2BCA%26rft.au%3DMoyle%252C%2BPB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/rra.3331,"invertebrate production,macrophytes,positive species interactions,salmonid habitat,spring-fed rivers","JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON,BETA-DIVERSITY,CHALK STREAM,AQUATIC MACROPHYTES,LOWLAND STREAMS,DRIFT,VEGETATION,FOOD,COMPLEXITY,ABUNDANCE",,"Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Watershed Sci Calif Trout, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA"
34,34,"Valois, R",May-jun 2018 ,Characterizing Stream-Aquifer Exchanges with Self-Potential Measurements,GROUNDWATER,"Characterizing the interactions between streams and aquifers is a major challenge in hydrology. Electrical self-potential (SP) is sensitive to groundwater flow through the electrokinetic effect, which is proportional to Darcy velocity. SP surveys have been extensively used for the characterization of seepage flow in a variety of contexts. But to our knowledge, a model coupling SP and groundwater flow has never been implemented for the study of stream-aquifer interactions. To address the issue, we first implemented a two-dimensional model to a synthetic stream-aquifer cross section. Results underline the very distinct nature of SP profiles in gaining or losing stream conditions. Second, we presented a field application in a transect crossing a stream in losing conditions. The coupled model successfully reproduced the observed SP profile. This inverse modeling of the SP signal provides quantitative data on hydrodynamic parameters (hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic heads) and geophysical parameters (coupling coefficient).

At this study site, in southern United Kingdom, alluvial deposits in the riparian zone can be considered as a patchwork of varying grades and types with an equally varied lateral connectivity. Some display good connection with the river system and others good connection with the groundwater system and, by definition, poorer connectivity with the surface water. By coupling tangential flow fractionation (TFF) with fluorescence analysis we were able to characterize the organic matter in the river and hyporheic zone. There is a significant proportion of particulate and colloidal fluorescent organic matter (FOM) within the river system and at depth within the gravels beneath the river channel. At depth in the hyporheic zone, the surface water inputs are dampened by mixing with deeper groundwater FOM. The shallow (0-0.5 m below river bed) hyporheic zone is highly dynamic as a result of changing surface water inputs from upstream processes. Labile C in the form of protein-like FOM appears to be attenuated preferentially compared to fulvic-like fluorescence in the hyporheic zone compared to the adjacent gravel and sand deposits. These preliminary findings have important implications for understanding nutrient and trace element mobility and attenuation within the groundwater, surface water, and hyporheic zone of permeable Chalk catchments. Fluorescence analysis of dissolved organic matter has been shown to be a useful environmental tracer that can be used in conjunction with other methods to understand GW-SW processes within a permeable Chalk catchment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000268632200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG00F02%26rft.atitle%3DUnderstanding%2Bgroundwater%252C%2Bsurface%2Bwater%252C%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bprocesses%2Bin%2Ba%2BChalk%2Bcatchment%2Busing%2Bfluorescence%2Bproperties%2Bof%2Bdissolved%2Band%2Bcolloidal%2Borganic%2Bmatter%26rft.aufirst%3DD.%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DDJ%26rft.aulast%3DLapworth%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009JG000921%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D114%26rft.au%3DLapworth%252C%2BDJ%26rft.au%3DGooddy%252C%2BDC%26rft.au%3DOld%252C%2BGH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2009JG000921,,"AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS,RIVER,FLOW,STREAM,CARBON,PHOSPHORUS,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS,LAMBOURN,EXCHANGE",,"British Geol Survey, Maclean Bldg, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England"
36,36,"Hassan, MA",Mar 15 2019 ,Variable hillslope-channel coupling and channel characteristics of forested mountain streams in glaciated landscapes,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Channel morphology of forested, mountain streams in glaciated landscapes is regulated by a complex suite of processes, and remains difficult to predict. Here, we analyze models of channel geometry against a comprehensive field dataset collected in two previously glaciated basins in Haida Gwaii, B.C., to explore the influence of variable hillslope-channel coupling imposed by the glacial legacy on channel form. Our objective is to better understand the relation between hillslope-channel coupling and stream character within glaciated basins. We find that the glacial legacy on landscape structure is characterized by relatively large spatial variation in hillslope-channel coupling. Spatial differences in coupling influence the frequency and magnitude of coarse sediment and woody material delivery to the channel network. Analyses using a model for channel gradient and multiple models for width and depth show that hillslope-channel coupling and high wood loading induce deviations from standard downstream predictions for all three variables in the study basins. Examination of model residuals using Boosted Regression Trees and nine additional channel variables indicates that similar to 10 to similar to 40% of residual variance can be explained by logjam variables, similar to 15-40% by the degree of hillslope-channel coupling, and 10-20% by proximity to slope failures. These results indicate that channel classification systems incorporating hillslope-channel coupling, and, indirectly, the catchment glacial legacy, may present a more complete understanding of mountain channels. From these results, we propose a conceptual framework which describes the linkages between landscape history, hillslope-channel coupling, and channel form.

Owing to the limitations of models and methods, prior research has mainly focused on vertical hyporheic exchange in river systems. Combined with the collected riparian zone temperature and water level data, a 2D hydrothermal coupling model of the riparian zone was developed using the thermal conductivity model, and the fitting effects of the Lu et al. (2007) model and Su et al. (2016) model on temperature variations in riparian zone comparatively analyzed. Then, the dynamic variation characteristics of the riparian zone temperature and the lateral hyporheic exchange recharge pattern were investigated by the constructed models. The calibrated model could reasonably illustrate the variations in the riparian zone temperature, and the sensitivity analysis revealed that the hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is the most sensitive factor to the temperature variations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000581930900031,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BComparison%2Bof%2BSu%2Band%2BLu%2BModeling%2Bof%2BHydro-Thermal%2BCoupling%2BModel%2BUsing%2BField%2BTemperature%2BRecords%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.15244%252Fpjoes%252F122690%26rft.eissn%3D2083-5906%26rft.epage%3D350%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1230-1485%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DPOLISH%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BSTUDIES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D337-350%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D337%26rft.stitle%3DPOL%2BJ%2BENVIRON%2BSTUD%26rft.volume%3D30%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BWB%26rft.au%3DGan%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=POLISH+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+STUDIES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.15244/pjoes/122690,"riparian zone,thermal conductivity model,Lu et al.

38,38,"Naganna, SR",Nov 2017 ,Factors influencing streambed hydraulic conductivity and their implications on stream-aquifer interaction: a conceptual review,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"The estimation and modeling of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) is an emerging interest due to its connection to water quality, aquatic habitat, and groundwater recharge. Existing research has found ways to sample and measure K at specific sites and with laboratory tests. The challenge undertaken was to review progress, relevance, complexity in understanding and modeling via statistical and geostatistical approaches, literature gaps, and suggestions toward future needs. This article provides an overview of factors and processes influencing streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) and its role in the stream-aquifer interaction. During our synthesis, we discuss the influence of geological, hydrological, biological, and anthropogenic factors that lead to variability of streambed substrates. Literature examples document findings to specific sites that help to portray the role of streambed K and other interrelated factors in the modeling of hyporheic and groundwater flow systems. However, studies utilizing an integrated, comprehensive database are limited, restricting the ability of broader application and understanding. Examples of in situ and laboratory methods of estimating hydraulic conductivity suggest challenges in acquiring representative samples and comparing results, considering the anisotropy and heterogeneity of fluvial bed materials and geohydrological conditions. Arriving at realistic statistical and spatial inference based on field and lab data collected is challenging, considering the possible sediment sources, processes, and complexity. Recognizing that the K for a given particle size group includes several to many orders of magnitude, modeling of streambed K and groundwater interaction remain conceptual and experimental. Advanced geostatistical techniques offer a wide range of univariate or multi-variate interpolation procedures such as kriging and variogram analysis that can be applied to these complex systems. Research available from various studies has been instrumental in developing sampling options, recognizing the significance of fluvial dynamics, the potential for filtration, transfer, and storage of high-quality groundwater, and importance to aquatic habitat and refuge during extreme conditions. Efforts in the characterization of natural and anthropogenic conditions, substrate materials, sediment loading, colmation, and other details highlight the great complexity and perhaps need for a database to compile relevant data. The effects on streambed hydraulic conductivity due to anthropogenic disturbances (in-stream gravel mining, contaminant release, benthic activity, etc.) are the areas that still need focus. An interdisciplinary (hydro-geo-biological) approach may be necessary to characterize the magnitude and variability of streambed K and fluxes at local, regional scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000414958700004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFactors%2Binfluencing%2Bstreambed%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Band%2Btheir%2Bimplications%2Bon%2Bstream-aquifer%2Binteraction%253A%2Ba%2Bconceptual%2Breview%26rft.aufirst%3DSujay%2BRaghavendra%26rft.auinit%3DSR%26rft.aulast%3DNaganna%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-017-0393-4%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D24789%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D32%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D24765-24789%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D24765%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DNaganna%252C%2BSR%26rft.au%3DDeka%252C%2BPC%26rft.au%3DHansen%252C%2BWF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11356-017-0393-4,"Hydraulic conductivity,Streambed,Stream-aquifer interaction,Anthropogenic activities,Colmation,Fluvial hydrology,Hyporheic zone","SURFACE-WATER INTERACTIONS,RIVER ALLUVIAL-FAN,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,TROPICAL STREAM,SEDIMENT YIELD,RESIDENCE TIME,GROUNDWATER,FLOW,TEMPERATURE",,"Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Dept Appl Mech & Hydraul, Mangalore 575025, India"

40,40,"Liu, XQ",Nov 2010 ,Estimation of minimum area requirement of river-connected lakes for fish diversity conservation in the Yangtze River floodplain,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,"AimHydrological disconnection of floodplains from rivers is among the top factors threatening river-floodplain ecosystems. To keep enough floodplain area is of great importance to biodiversity conservation. In the Yangtze River floodplain, most lakes were disconnected from the mainstream by dams in 1950-1970s. By analysing fish diversity data, we aim at determining the effects of river-lake disconnection on fish diversity, at estimating the minimum protected area of river-connected lakes and at proposing a holistic strategy for fish conservation in the mid-lower reaches of the river.LocationThe Yangtze River floodplain, China.MethodsWe collected recorded data of fish diversity of 30 Yangtze floodplain lakes. Species-area relationships were analysed and compared between river-connected and river-disconnected lakes. Cumulative species-area models were constructed to estimate the minimum protected area of river-connected lakes.ResultsRiver-lake disconnection reduced fish diversity of Yangtze lakes by 38.1%, so that the river-connected lakes play an important role in maintaining the floodplain biodiversity. The minimum protected area of river-connected lakes was estimated to be 14,400 km2. Therefore, we should not only protect the existent connected lakes of 5500 km2, but also reconnect disconnected lakes of at least 8900 km2 in the Yangtze basin.Main conclusionsSpecies-area relationships are of importance in reserve design. We suggest that cumulative species-area model might be more suitable for ecosystems with high connectivity among regions such as floodplains. As the Yangtze River floodplain is an integrative ecosystem, we suggest establishing a holistic nature reserve in the mid-lower basin for effective conservation of biodiversity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000283375900006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEstimation%2Bof%2Bminimum%2Barea%2Brequirement%2Bof%2Briver-connected%2Blakes%2Bfor%2Bfish%2Bdiversity%2Bconservation%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2Bfloodplain%26rft.aufirst%3DXueqin%26rft.auinit%3DXQ%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1472-4642.2010.00706.x%26rft.eissn%3D1472-4642%26rft.epage%3D940%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1366-9516%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DDIVERSITY%2BAND%2BDISTRIBUTIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D932-940%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D932%26rft.stitle%3DDIVERS%2BDISTRIB%26rft.volume%3D16%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BXQ%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BHZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=DIVERSITY+AND+DISTRIBUTIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00706.x,"Cumulative species-area model,holistic conservation strategy,hydrological connectivity,protected area,river-lake disconnection,species diversity","WATER,ECOSYSTEMS,PLAINS",,"Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China"

This study updates the i-Tree Cool River model to simulate restoration of these processes to reverse the urban river syndrome, while using the HEC-RAS model water surface profiles needed for flood hazard analysis in restoration planning. The new model was tested in a mountain river within the New York City drinking water supply area (Sawmill, SM, Creek), and then used for base case and restoration scenarios on the 17.5 km reach of the Los Angeles (LA) River where a multi-million dollar riverine restoration project is planned. The model simulated the LA River average temperature in the base case decreased from 29.5 degrees C by 0.3 degrees C when warm surface inflows were converted to cooler groundwater inflows by terrestrial green infrastructure; by 0.7 degrees C when subsurface hyporheic exchange was increased by removal of armoring and installation of riffle-pool bedforms; by 3.6 degrees C when riparian forests shaded the river; and by 6.4 degrees C when floodplain forests were added to riparian forests to cool surface reservoirs and local air temperatures. Applying all four restoration treatments lowered river temperature by 7.2 degrees C. The simulated decreases in river temperature lead to increased saturated dissolved oxygen levels, reaching 8.7 mg/L, up from the 7.6 mg/L in the base case scenario, providing improved fish habitat and reducing eutrophication and hypoxic zones.

43,43,"Sjodin, A",Mar 2001 ,Analysis of groundwater exchange for a large plains river in Colorado (USA),HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Complete daily water budget information was assembled for a 105 km segment. of the South Platte River in the plains region below Denver, CO, for the period 1983-1993. The data were used in testing the possibility that dependence of alluvial exchange mechanisms on stage height, as shown by models of alluvial exchange, allows alluvial exchange to be predicted continuously over a given reach through use of statistical information on river discharge. The study segment was divided into an upper and a lower reach; daily alluvial exchanges for each reach were estimated by the method of residuals. The two reaches show small (15%) but statistically significant annual differences in rates of exchange. For each reach, there is a seasonal pattern (2 .5-fold oscillation) in alluvial discharge to the channel, reflecting seasonality in recharge of the alluvium by irrigation. At discharges up to 40 m(3)/s (82nd percentile), alluvial discharge to the channel occurs at a rate independent of river discharge. Above 40 m(3)/s, net alluvial discharge into the channel is progressively reduced; at 60 m(3)/s (92nd percentile) there is no net alluvial exchange. At still higher river discharges, water is lost to the alluvium through bank storage at a rate that is linearly related to the logarithm of discharge. Annually, alluvial discharge accounts for 15-18% of water entering the study segment, and alluvial recharge through bank storage accounts for 2-48 of water leaving the segment. Alluvial recharge through bank storage at the highest discharges can, however, exceed low-flow alluvial discharge rates by five-fold over short intervals. Even though daily alluvial exchanges vary widely, they can be estimated at r(2) values above 80% on the basis of reach, season, and river discharge.

These processes exert an important control on long-term landscape evolution but they are still poorly understood and inadequately quantified. The proposed experimental device is an annular flume with four fluid injections coupled to a close water circuit and a powerful pump, in order to reach hydrodynamic conditions up to whose prevailing in mountain streams. Fluid surface geometry and visualization experiments with a high speed camera allow us to monitor hydrodynamic variables and sediment motion during the experiments. Despite the circular geometry of the flume, pebble trajectories are found to closely mimic the bedload behavior in straight flume. Based also on a direct comparison with pebble abrasion rates along a large Himalayan River, we hypothesize that our device simulates in a realistic way transport processes and consequently abrasion processes in mountain rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000237670100009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNew%2Bfacility%2Bto%2Bstudy%2Briver%2Babrasion%2Bprocesses%26rft.aufirst%3DMikael%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DAttal%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%25290733-9429%25282006%2529132%253A6%2528624%2529%26rft.eissn%3D1943-7900%26rft.epage%3D628%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0733-9429%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDRAULIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D624-628%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D624%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDRAUL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D132%26rft.au%3DAttal%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLave%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DMasson%252C%2BJP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDRAULIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2006)132:6(624),"flumes,sediment transport,rivers,mountain streams","GRAVEL SALTATION,SEDIMENT",,"Lab Geodynam Chaines Alpines, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble, France"

Stationary and mobile phases were examined for the simultaneous separation of both anions and cations. Cations detection by UV detection requires a mobile phase with a UV absorbing additive, which indirectly visualizes cations as negative peaks. Simultaneous separation of anions and cations were achieved when using an eluent that consists of inorganic acid with weak basic amino acid as additives. It was convenient to separate both anions and cations by coupling anion-exchange and cation-exchange columns in tandem. The order of the separation columns connected affected the elution profiles. When the eluent comprises of multiple anions and a single cation, the anion-exchange column should be connected in the upper stream, whereas when the eluent comprises multiple cations and a single anion, the cation-exchange column should be connected in the upper stream. Use of switching valves also allowed simultaneous separation of anions and cations in a single chromatographic run. In the present work, operating conditions were optimized for the simultaneous separation of anions and cations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Hg(II) transport through a cation exchange membrane was coupled with its bioreduction to Hg-0 in order to achieve Hg removal from concentrated streams, with minimal production of contaminated by-products observed. This study involves (1) membrane selection, (2) demonstration of process effectiveness for removing Hg from drinking water to below the 1 ppb recommended limit, and (3) process application for treatment of concentrated water streams, where >98% of the Hg was removed, and the throughput of contaminated water was optimised through membrane pre-treatment. The IEMB process represents a novel mercury treatment technology with minimal generation of contaminated waste, thereby reducing the overall environmental impact of the process.

47,47,"Liu, XM",Jan 1 2015 ,Processes controlling delta Li-7 in rivers illuminated by study of streams and groundwaters draining basalts,EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS,"We evaluate the factors influencing the abundance, [Li], and isotopic composition of riverine Li delivered to the oceans through analyses and modeling of [Li] and delta Li-7 in streams and groundwaters draining a single continental lithology, the Columbia River Basalts (CRBs). The streams were sampled in different climate zones that lie east (dry), and west (wet) of the Cascades Mountains, and during two different seasons (summer and late winter) in order to evaluate climatic and seasonal influences on Li isotopes in rivers. Dissolved Li (delta Li-7(dis) = +9.3 to +30.4) is systematically heavier than that of fresh or weathered CRBs (-4.7 to +6.0, Liu et al., 2013), suspended loads (-5.9 to -0.3), and shallow groundwaters (+6.7 to +9.4), consistent with previous studies showing that Li isotope fractionation is affected by equilibration between stream water and secondary minerals. However, the lack of correlation between delta Li-7(dis) and climate zone, the uniform secondary minerals and bedrock, coupled with the highly variable (>20 parts per thousand) delta Li-7(dis) indicate that other factors exert a strong control on delta Li-7(dis). In particular, the heavier Li in streams compared to the shallow groundwaters that feed them indicates that continued isotopic fractionation between stream water and suspended and/or bed loads has a major influence on riverine delta Li-7. Seasonal delta Li-7 variation is observed only for streams west of the Cascades, where the difference in precipitation rate between the dry and wet seasons is greatest. Reactive transport model simulations reveal that riverine delta Li-7 is strongly controlled by subsurface residence times and the Li isotope fractionation occurring within rivers. The latter explains why there is no positive correlation between delta Li-7 and traditional weathering proxies such as Si or normalized Si in rivers, as riverine Li isotope fractionation drives delta Li-7 to higher values during transport, whereas the concentrations of major cations and anions are diluted. The varying residence time for groundwaters feeding the western streams in summer (long residence times, higher delta Li-7, greater weathering) and winter (short residence times, lower delta Li-7, less weathering) explains the observed seasonal variations. A global, negative correlation between delta Li-7 and Li/Na for streams and rivers draining basaltic catchments reflects the overall transport time, hence the amount of silicate weathering. Based on our results, the increase of delta Li-7 in seawater during the Cenozoic is unlikely related to changing climate, but may reflect mountain building giving rise to increased silicate weathering.

49,49,"Beltran, J",Aug 2021 ,The impact of stream-groundwater exchange on seasonal nitrate loads in an urban stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Urbanization negatively impacts water quality in streams by reducing stream-groundwater interactions, which can reduce a stream's capacity to naturally attenuate nitrate. Meadowbrook Creek, a first order urban stream in Syracuse, New York, has an inverse urbanization gradient, with heavily urbanized headwaters that are disconnected from the floodplain and downstream reaches that have intact riparian floodplains and connection to riparian aquifers. This system allows assessment of how stream-groundwater interactions in urban streams impact the net sources and sinks of nitrate at the reach scale. We used continuous (15-min) streamflow measurements and weekly grab samples at three gauging stations positioned longitudinally along the creek to develop continuous nitrate load estimates at the inlet and outlet of two contrasting reaches. Nitrate load estimates were determined using a USGS linear regression model, RLOADEST, and differences between loads at the inlet and outlet of contrasting reaches were used to quantify nitrate sink and source behaviour year-round. We observed a nitrate load of 1.4 x 10(4) kg NO3- per water year, on average, at the outlet of the urbanized reach while the nitrate load at the outlet of the downstream, connected reach was 1.0 x 10(4) kg NO3- per water year, on average. We found the more heavily urbanized, hydrologically-disconnected reach was a net source of nitrate regardless of season. In contrast, stream-groundwater exchange caused the hydrologically connected reach to be both a source and sink for nitrate, depending on time of year. Both reaches alter nitrate source and sink behaviour at various spatiotemporal scales. Groundwater connection in the downstream, connected reach reduces annual nitrate loads and provides more opportunities for sources and sinks of nitrate year-round than the hydrologically disconnected stream reach. Mechanisms include groundwater discharge into the stream with variable nitrate concentrations, surface-water groundwater interactions that foster denitrification, and stream load loss to surrounding near-stream aquifers. This study emphasizes how loads are important in understanding how stream-groundwater interactions impact reach scale nitrate export in urban streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000691011400006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14324%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bimpact%2Bof%2Bstream-groundwater%2Bexchange%2Bon%2Bseasonal%2Bnitrate%2Bloads%2Bin%2Ban%2Burban%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DJulio%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DBeltran%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14324%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DBeltran%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DLautz%252C%2BLK%26rft.au%3DSlosson%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0AD487EUQjL1EhhpTgU2Azh&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14324,"nitrate,nitrate loading,surface water-groundwater interaction,urban hydrology","NITROGEN FLUXES,WATER-QUALITY,URBANIZATION,RESTORATION,METABOLISM,CATCHMENT,CARBON,DENITRIFICATION,BURIAL",,"Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13035 USA"
