0,"Leathwick, JR",Jun 2009 ,Robust planning for restoring diadromous fish species in New Zealand's lowland rivers and streams,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"We used statistical models to predict the distributions of 15 native diadromous fish species across New Zealand's river and stream network, and demonstrate their potential use for guiding the restoration of freshwater ecosystems. Models were fitted to an extensive collection of field samples describing the distributions of individual fish species, coupled with a set of environmental predictors chosen primarily for their functional relevance to diadromous fish species. Models were fitted to observations of species occurrence using boosted regression trees (BRT), an advanced regression technique that combines excellent predictive performance with good description of relationships between species occurrence and individual environmental predictors. Environment-based predictions of species distributions were then made for all river and stream segments. We explored the use of these predictions to guide the selection of sites where diadromous species are likely to occur, and to set restoration. targets, once a restoration site has been selected. Descriptions of the environmental preferences of the different species, based on relationships revealed by the statistical models, provide important clues to the likely responses of species to restoration of favourable environmental conditions, e.g., by restoring riparian shade and/or when reinstating access to/from the sea.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000269403900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRobust%2Bplanning%2Bfor%2Brestoring%2Bdiadromous%2Bfish%2Bspecies%2Bin%2BNew%2BZealand%2527s%2Blowland%2Brivers%2Band%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DJR%26rft.aulast%3DLeathwick%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F00288330909510032%26rft.epage%3D671%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0028-8330%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DNEW%2BZEALAND%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D659-671%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D659%26rft.stitle%3DNEW%2BZEAL%2BJ%2BMAR%2BFRESH%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DLeathwick%252C%2BJR%26rft.au%3DElith%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DJulian%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=NEW+ZEALAND+JOURNAL+OF+MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Addy, K",Jun 19 2019 ,Connectivity and Nitrate Uptake Potential of Intermittent Streams in the Northeast USA,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Non-perennial streams dominate the extent of stream networks worldwide. Intermittent streams can provide ecosystem services to the entire network- including nitrate uptake to alleviate eutrophication of coastal waters-and are threatened by lack of legal protection. We examined 12 intermittent streams in the temperate, humid climate of the Northeast USA. Over 3 years of monitoring, continuous flow was observed a median of 277 d yr(-1), with no-flow conditions from early summer into fall. Estimated median discharge was 2.9 L s(-1) or 0.36 d(-1) mm All intermittent streams originated from source wetlands (median area: 0.27 ha) and the median length of the intermittent stream from the source wetland to the downstream perennial stream was 344 m. Through regional geospatial analysis with high resolution orthophotography, we estimated that widely available, ""high resolution"" (1:24,000) hydrography databases (e.g., NHDPlus HR) only displayed 43% of the total number of intermittent streams. Whole-stream gross nitrate-N uptake rates were estimated at six intermittent streams during continuous flow conditions using pulse additions of nitrate and a conservative tracer. These rates displayed high temporal variability (range: no detect to over 6,000 mg N m(-1) d(-1)); hot moments were noted in nine of the 65 pulse additions. Whole-stream gross nitrate-N uptake rates were significantly inversely related to discharge, with no measurable rates above 7 L s(-1). Temperature was significantly positively correlated with whole-stream gross nitrate-N uptake rates, with more hot moments in the spring. Microbial assays demonstrated that nitrate cycling in intermittent streams are consistent with results from low order, perennial forested streams and highlighted the importance of debris dams and pools-potential locations for transient storage. Our assessment suggests that intermittent streams in our region may annually contribute 24-47% of the flow to perennial streams and potentially remove 4.1 to 80.4 kg nitrate-N km(-2) annually. If development in these areas continues, perennial streams are in danger of losing a portion of their headwaters and potential nitrate uptake areas may become nitrate sources to downstream areas. These results argue to manage fluvial systems with a holistic approach that couples intermittent and perennial components.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000472093800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B225%26rft.atitle%3DConnectivity%2Band%2BNitrate%2BUptake%2BPotential%2Bof%2BIntermittent%2BStreams%2Bin%2Bthe%2BNortheast%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DKelly%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DAddy%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffevo.2019.00225%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2296-701X%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BECOLOGY%2BAND%2BEVOLUTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BECOL%2BEVOL%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DAddy%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DGold%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DGroffman%252C%2BPM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+ECOLOGY+AND+EVOLUTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
2,"Prancevic, JP",Feb 28 2019 ,Topographic Controls on the Extension and Retraction of Flowing Streams,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Flowing stream networks extend and retract as their surrounding landscapes wet up and dry out, both seasonally and during rainstorms, with implications for aquatic ecosystems and greenhouse gas exchange. Some networks are much more dynamic than others, however, and the reasons for this difference are unknown. Here we show that the tendency of stream networks to extend and retract can be predicted from down-valley changes in topographic attributes (slope, curvature, and contributing drainage area), without measuring subsurface hydrologic properties. Topography determines where water accumulates within valley networks, and we propose that it also modulates flow partitioning between the surface and subsurface. Measurements from 17 mountain stream networks support this hypothesis, showing that undissected valley heads have greater subsurface transport capacities than sharply incised valleys downstream. In catchments where broad valley heads rapidly transition to sharply incised valleys, subsurface transport capacity decreases abruptly, stabilizing stream length through wet and dry periods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000461855600021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTopographic%2BControls%2Bon%2Bthe%2BExtension%2Band%2BRetraction%2Bof%2BFlowing%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJeff%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DPrancevic%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018GL081799%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D2092%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2084-2092%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2084%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DPrancevic%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DKirchner%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
3,"Wu, GP",Jul 2016 ,Mapping Dynamics of Inundation Patterns of Two Largest River-Connected Lakes in China: A Comparative Study,REMOTE SENSING,"Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake are the two largest freshwater lakes in China. The lakes are located approximately 300 km apart on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and are differently connected through their respective tributary systems, which will lead to different river-lake water exchanges and discharges. Thus, differences in their morphological and hydrological conditions should induce individual lake spatio-temporal inundation patterns. Quantitative comparative analyses of the dynamic inundation patterns of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake are of great importance to basic biogeochemical and ecological studies. In this study, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery and a geographic information system (GIS) analysis method, we systematically compared the spatio-temporal inundation patterns of the two river-connected lakes by analyses of the lake area, the inundation frequencies (IFs) and the water variation rates (WVRs). The results indicate that there was a significant declining trend in the lakes' inundation area from 2000 to 2011. The inundation areas of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, decreased by 54.74% and 40.46%, with an average annual decrease rate of 109.74 km(2)/y and 52.37 km(2)/y, respectively. The alluvial regions near Dongting Lake expressed much lower inundation frequencies, averaged over multiple years, than the alluvial regions near Poyang Lake. There was an obvious spatial gradient in the distribution of water inundation for Poyang Lake; the monthly mean IF slowly increased from north to south during the low-water, rising, and high-water periods. However, Dongting Lake expressed a clear zonal distribution of water inundation, especially in the low-water and rising periods. In addition, the WVRs of the two lakes differently changed in space throughout the year, but were in good agreement with the changing processes of water expansion or shrinkage. The different inundation frequencies and water variation rates in the two lakes may possibly depend on many intrinsic factors, including surface discharges from their respective tributaries, river-lake water exchanges and the lakes' topographical characteristics. These findings are valuable for policymakers because they may lead to different decisions and policies for these two complex river-lake systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000382224800030,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B560%26rft.atitle%3DMapping%2BDynamics%2Bof%2BInundation%2BPatterns%2Bof%2BTwo%2BLargest%2BRiver-Connected%2BLakes%2Bin%2BChina%253A%2BA%2BComparative%2BStudy%26rft.aufirst%3DGuiping%26rft.auinit%3DGP%26rft.aulast%3DWu%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Frs8070560%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2072-4292%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DREMOTE%2BSENSING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DREMOTE%2BSENS-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BGP%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BYB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=REMOTE+SENSING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Leibowitz, SG",Apr 2018 ,Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to Downstream Waters: An Integrated Systems Framework,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Interest in connectivity has increased in the aquatic sciences, partly because of its relevance to the Clean Water Act. This paper has two objectives: (1) provide a framework to understand hydrological, chemical, and biological connectivity, focusing on how headwater streams and wetlands connect to and contribute to rivers; and (2) briefly review methods to quantify hydrological and chemical connectivity. Streams and wetlands affect river structure and function by altering material and biological fluxes to the river; this depends on two factors: (1) functions within streams and wetlands that affect material fluxes; and (2) connectivity (or isolation) from streams and wetlands to rivers that allows (or prevents) material transport between systems. Connectivity can be described in terms of frequency, magnitude, duration, timing, and rate of change. It results from physical characteristics of a system, e.g., climate, soils, geology, topography, and the spatial distribution of aquatic components. Biological connectivity is also affected by traits and behavior of the biota. Connectivity can be altered by human impacts, often in complex ways. Because of variability in these factors, connectivity is not constant but varies over time and space. Connectivity can be quantified with field-based methods, modeling, and remote sensing. Further studies using these methods are needed to classify and quantify connectivity of aquatic ecosystems and to understand how impacts affect connectivity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000428882400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConnectivity%2Bof%2BStreams%2Band%2BWetlands%2Bto%2BDownstream%2BWaters%253A%2BAn%2BIntegrated%2BSystems%2BFramework%26rft.aufirst%3DScott%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DSG%26rft.aulast%3DLeibowitz%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.12631%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D322%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D298-322%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D298%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DLeibowitz%252C%2BSG%26rft.au%3DWigington%252C%2BPJ%26rft.au%3DGolden%252C%2BHE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"Chen, XH",Jan 15 2011 ,Depth-dependent hydraulic conductivity distribution patterns of a streambed,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Characterization of streambed hydraulic conductivity from the channel surface to a great depth below the channel surface can provide needed information for the determination of stream-aquifer hydrologic connectedness, and it is also important to river restoration. However, knowledge on the streambed hydraulic conductivity for sediments 1 m below the channel surface is scarce. This study describes a method that was used to determine the distribution patterns of streambed hydraulic conductivity for sediments from channel surface to a depth of 15 m below. The method includes Geoprobe's direct-push techniques and Permeameter tests. Direct-push techniques were used to generate the electrical conductivity (EC) logs and to collect sequences of continuous sediment cores from river channels, as well as from the alluvial aquifer connected to the river. Permeameter tests on these sediment cores give the profiles of vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) of the channel sediments and the aquifer materials. This method was applied to produce K-v profiles for a streambed and an alluvial aquifer in the Platte River Valley of Nebraska, USA. Comparison and statistical analysis of the K-v profiles from the river channel and from the proximate alluvial aquifer indicates a special pattern of K-v in the channel sediments. This depth-dependent pattern of K-v distribution for the channel sediments is considered to be produced by hyporheic processes. This K-v-distribution pattern implied that the effect of hyporheic processes on streambed hydraulic conductivity can reach the sediments about 9 m below the channel surface.

6,"Jiricek, T",2015 ,Recovery of salts from ion-exchange regeneration streams by a coupled nanofiltration-membrane distillation process,WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"Ion-exchange tap water demineralization for process water preparation results in a saline regeneration wastewater (20-100 mS cm(-1)) that is increasingly problematic in view of discharge. A coupled nanofiltration-membrane distillation (NF-MD) process is evaluated for the recovery of water and sodium chloride from this wastewater. NF-MD treatment of mixed regeneration wastewater is compared to NF-MD treatment of separate anion-and cation-regenerate fractions. NF on mixed regeneration wastewater results in a higher flux (30 L m(-2) h(-1) at 7 bar) compared to NF on the separate fractions (6-9 Lm(-2) h(-1) at 30 bar). NF permeate recovery is strongly limited by scaling (50% for separate and 60% for mixed, respectively). Physical signs of scaling were found during MD treatment of the NF permeates but did not result in flux decline for mixed regeneration wastewater. Final salt composition is expected to qualify as a road de-icing salt. NF-MD is an economically viable alternative compared to external disposal of wastewater for larger-scale installations (1.4 versus 2.5 euro m(-3) produced demineralized water for a 10 m(3) regenerate per day plant). The cost benefits of water re-use and salt recuperation are small when compared to total treatment costs for mixed regenerate wastewater.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000358048500011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRecovery%2Bof%2Bsalts%2Bfrom%2Bion-exchange%2Bregeneration%2Bstreams%2Bby%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2Bnanofiltration-membrane%2Bdistillation%2Bprocess%26rft.aufirst%3DTomas%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DJiricek%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fwst.2015.215%26rft.eissn%3D1996-9732%26rft.epage%3D259%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0273-1223%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D252-259%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D252%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D72%26rft.au%3DJiricek%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DDe%2BSchepper%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DGenne%252C%2BI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=WATER+SCIENCE+AND+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
7,"MULHOLLAND, PJ",Jun 1994 ,EFFECT OF PERIPHYTON BIOMASS ON HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS AND NUTRIENT CYCLING IN STREAMS,OECOLOGIA,"The effect of periphyton biomass on hydraulic characteristics and nutrient cycling was studied in laboratory streams with and without snail herbivores. Hydraulic characteristics, such as average water velocity, dispersion coefficients, and relative volume of transient storage zones (zones of stationary water), were quantified by performing short-term injections of a conservative tracer and fitting an advection-dispersion model to the conservative tracer concentration profile downstream from the injection site. Nutrient cycling was quantified by measuring two indices: (1) uptake rate of phosphorus from stream water normalized to gross primary production (GPP), a surrogate measure of total P demand, and (2) turnover rate of phosphorus in the periphyton matrix. These measures indicate the importance of internal cycling (within the periphyton matrix) in meeting the P demands of periphyton. Dense growths of filamentous diatoms and blue-green algae accumulated in the streams with no snails (high-biomass streams), whereas the periphyton communities in streams with snails consisted almost entirely of a thin layer of basal cells of Stigeoclonium sp. (low-biomass streams). Dispersion coefficients were significantly greater and transient storage zones were significantly larger in the high-biomass. streams compared to the low-biomass streams. Rates of GPP-normalized P uptake from water and rates of P turnover in periphyton were significantly lower in high biomass than in low biomass periphyton communities, suggesting that a greater fraction of the P demand was met by recycling in the high biomass communities. Increases in streamwater P concentration significantly increased GPP-normalized P uptake in high biomass communities, suggesting diffusion limitation of nutrient transfer from stream water to algal cells in these communities. Our results demonstrate that accumulations of periphyton biomass can alter the hydraulic characteristics of streams, particularly by increasing transient storage zones, and can increase internal nutrient cycling.

Efforts have been made to assess connectivity between wetlands and streams and possible management implications by comparing existing wetland and stream maps (e.g., National Hydrography Dataset [NHD]) but the reliability of these assessments is affected by the accuracy and inherent nature of input datasets. Stream datasets derived using semi-automated and automated interpretation of LiDAR derived digital elevation models were found to be considerably more accurate than NHD High Resolution (12% less accurate than automatically generated streams) and Plus (29% less accurate than automatically generated streams) and in general use of LiDAR derived datasets was found to significantly increase percent area and total number of wetlands that were considered connected at multiple buffer lengths ranging from 0 to 80 m. When wetland-stream connectivity as judged using NHD was compared to a semi-automatically generated highly accurate LiDAR derived stream dataset, the High Resolution NHD was found to underestimate semi-natural palustrine wetland area connected by 15% and number of wetlands connected by 13% on average while NHD Plus was found to underestimate semi-natural palustrine wetland area and number connected by 27% on average.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000303884100006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEnhanced%2BDetection%2Bof%2BWetland-Stream%2BConnectivity%2BUsing%2BLiDAR%26rft.aufirst%3DMegan%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DLang%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs13157-012-0279-7%26rft.eissn%3D1943-6246%26rft.epage%3D473%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0277-5212%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWETLANDS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D461-473%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D461%26rft.stitle%3DWETLANDS%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DLang%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DMcDonough%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DWilen%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=WETLANDS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

In this study. the free software QUAL2Kw was used to evaluate the impacts of agricultural nitrogen (N) excess on river nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations. We explored the possibility to use QUAL2Kw in order to back calculate the exchange of water and N from the groundwater to the Oglio River, northern Italy, which drains a heavily irrigated and fertilized agricultural land. Along the river course water monitoring activities carried out in the dry, summer period revealed steep increases of NO3-N in different sectors, by up to 2 orders of magnitude, not explained by any significant point inputs. Such increases suggest the occurrence of large water exchange with nitrate-polluted groundwater and diffuse inputs. In turn. groundwater pollution is due to high N excess in the watershed (similar to 200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), flood-based irrigation techniques and soil permeability. The QUAL2Kw model was calibrated using the average of 2 years' data collected in winter 2010 and 2011 and validated using the data of winter 2012. To minimize the error between simulation results and measured data, the constants of inorganic suspended solid (ISS). ammonium (NII-N), nitrate and organic N were calibrated. The calibration and validation results showed a good correspondence between the calculated and measured values for most of water-quality variables. QUAL2Kw was then run separately with three years' summer data (2009, 2010 and 2011), and large gaps were found between the measured and predicted values of discharge, electrical conductivity, NO3-N and total N. Such gaps are discussed in terms of river-groundwater interactions, limited to the summer period and following irrigation by flooding, rise of the groundwater table and vertical transport of N. The gaps allowed to back calculate the volumes of water and the amount of N exchanged. The total load of NO3-N entering into the river from groundwater was estimated in 25.17, 25.63 and 29.89 ton per day for NO3-N in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Similar results were obtained in another study based on mass balance of N isotopes. The combination of experimental and QUAL2Kw modelled data proved to be a simple, low cost but effective tool in the estimation of NO3-N exchange between the surface and groundwater.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000456092500009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DApplication%2Bof%2BQUAL2Kw%2Bto%2Bthe%2BOglio%2BRiver%2B%2528Northern%2BItaly%2529%2Bto%2Bassess%2Bdiffuse%2BN%2Bpollution%2Bvia%2Briver-groundwater%2Binteraction%26rft.aufirst%3DHajar%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DTaherisoudejani%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4081%252Fjlimnol.2018.1761%26rft.eissn%3D1723-8633%26rft.epage%3D465%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1129-5767%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D452-465%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D452%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D77%26rft.au%3DTaherisoudejani%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DRacchetti%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DBartoli%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Kwak, MT",Jan 9 2023 ,Impact of dynamic factors on the exchange flow between two neighboring bays with contrasting topography during summer: A numerical study,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,"A high-resolution, three-dimensional numerical ocean model was employed to understand the exchange flow through Noryang Channel, which connects Gwangyang Bay and Jinju Bay. These two bays exhibit contrasting topographies, with Gwangyang Bay connected to the open ocean through a broad and deep channel, whereas Jinju Bay is relatively isolated from the open ocean by a narrow and shallow channel. Numerical experiments were conducted to determine the contribution of river discharge, wind stress, surface heat flux, and tides to the exchange flow between the two bays during summer. The results suggested that river discharge was the dominant factor affecting the exchange flow along Noryang Channel. Particularly, a high river discharge during summer increased the sea level in Jinju Bay, creating a barotropic flow toward Gwangyang Bay. However, the dense water entering Gwangyang Bay through the wide and deep channel generated a baroclinic flow toward Jinju Bay along the lower layer of Noryang Channel. An analytical model supported the conclusion that river discharge is the main driver of the exchange flow in Noryang Channel.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000919859500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1061189%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2Bdynamic%2Bfactors%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bexchange%2Bflow%2Bbetween%2Btwo%2Bneighboring%2Bbays%2Bwith%2Bcontrasting%2Btopography%2Bduring%2Bsummer%253A%2BA%2Bnumerical%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DMyeong-Taek%26rft.auinit%3DMT%26rft.aulast%3DKwak%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffmars.2022.1061189%26rft.eissn%3D2296-7745%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BMARINE%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BMAR%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DKwak%252C%2BMT%26rft.au%3DCho%252C%2BYK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+MARINE+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
11,"Ivkovic, KM",Feb 25 2009 ,A top-down approach to characterise aquifer-river interaction processes,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The interconnections between groundwater and river systems remain poorly understood in many catchments throughout the world. and yet they are fundamental to effectively managing the quantity and quality of water resources. Many of the techniques traditionally employed by hydrogeologists and hydrologists rely on characterising the groundwater flow systems, topography, geology/aquifer systems, climate and/or the rainfall-runoff processes within a river basin. These studies can provide useful process characterisations that are fundamental to developing a physical understanding of hydrological processes within a specified region. However, in many instances the findings are descriptive and the results are difficult to up-scale to the larger sub-catchment/catchment scale at which water is managed and allocated. Moreover, they may have significant time and cost requirements. An alternative approach is to collate a range of hydrometric data, that for many catchments may already available, and to then analyse data patterns and infer processes from the data without being overly concerned about the details of the physical processes driving the system taking a top-down approach. In this paper the river reaches in the semi-arid Namoi River catchment in Australia were characterised according to three levels of information; namely: (1) presence of aquifer-river hydraulic connection; (2) dominant direction of flux; and (3) the potential for groundwater extraction to impact on river flows. The methods used to characterise the river reaches included an analysis of: (1) groundwater and river channel base elevations using a GIS/database; (2) stream hydrograph data; (3) flow duration data: (4) vertical aquifer connectivity at nested piezometer sites; and (5) paired river and groundwater hydrographs. The data patterns seen in the stream gauging station derived data for gaining, losing and variably gaining-losing river reaches were described together with the general processes that operate in these systems. Subsequently, a map was prepared for the Namoi River catchment river reaches indicating aquifer-river connectivity and dominant direction of flux. The potential for groundwater extraction to impact on river flows was also assessed and found to be a significant issue for the connected aquifer-river systems. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Average Ellenberg inidicator values, stream distances and relative elevations of the releves were passively projected onto PCA to show ecological relationships among them. Correlations of plant functional type and stream distance gradients were calculated with regression analysis. For the main edifiers response curves to the stream distance gradients were made. The classification of the Mura floodplain forests has revealed three ecologically interpretable vegetation types: Salicetum albae (most humid and nutrient-rich sites), Fraxino-Ulmetum allietosum ursini (ecologically intermediate sites), F-U. quercetosum robori (the driest and the least nutrient-rich sites). Zonation of vegetation is connected to distance from the closest stream which influences species distribution through ecological gradients of moisture and nutrient.

13,"Rodrigues, M",Jun 2011 ,Modeling fecal contamination in the Aljezur coastal stream (Portugal),OCEAN DYNAMICS,"This study aims at understanding the fecal contamination behavior in a small coastal stream (Aljezur, Portugal), which has significant economic and ecological values. Like in most small coastal systems, circulation and water renewal in the Aljezur stream exhibit a strong variability due to their dependence on tides, waves, intermittent river flows, and a highly variable morphology. Hence, the problem was approached through a combination of field surveys and the development and application of a hard-coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and fecal contamination model. Salinity and temperature results have shown that mixing and transport in the stream are very sensitive to the river flow and wind forcing. The model is able to represent the main patterns and trends observed in Escherichia coli and fecal enterococcus concentrations along the stream, for different environmental and contamination conditions, suggesting die-off rates on the order of 0.50-0.55 day(-1). Die-off rate and the representation of the sediment-associated processes were identified as the major remaining sources of uncertainty in the model. Results show that, owing to the processes that occur along the stream, fecal bacteria reach the beaches water in numbers that comply with the European Bathing Waters Directive, even during the summer periods when the upstream concentrations are larger. In particular, results suggest a direct relation between the tidal propagation upstream and the reduction of the fecal bacteria concentrations along the stream that can be relevant for the development of a strategy for the management of the system's water safety.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000292275100009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bfecal%2Bcontamination%2Bin%2Bthe%2BAljezur%2Bcoastal%2Bstream%2B%2528Portugal%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DMarta%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DRodrigues%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10236-011-0392-9%26rft.eissn%3D1616-7228%26rft.epage%3D856%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1616-7341%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DOCEAN%2BDYNAMICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D841-856%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D841%26rft.stitle%3DOCEAN%2BDYNAM%26rft.volume%3D61%26rft.au%3DRodrigues%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DOliveira%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DCravo%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=OCEAN+DYNAMICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Therefore, inspired by the nexus approach, this study investigates these three systems, integrated as a WPE coupling system. This paper aims to construct a system dynamics model from the perspective of socio-hydrology in order to predict and understand the coevolution trajectories and dynamics of the WPE coupling system. Firstly, the system dynamics model, which comprises the conceptual, stock and flow diagrams, and stylized models, is constructed to describe the dynamics of state variables of the WPE system. Then, the model is implemented in the WPE system of the upper Yangtze River basin of China. Results show that (1) the system dynamics model, which considers two-way feedbacks, is capable of modeling the coevolution of the WPE system and provides a powerful tool for exploring and understanding the emergent properties of the system; (2) the interrelation between economic development and environmental health is not entirely contradictory; however, if the economic development scale is not limited, their relationship will gradually evolve in the direction of contradiction; and (3) model parameters not only affect the timing and magnitude of the evolution trajectories of state variables but also their evolution patterns. These observations, obtained by modeling interactions across different systems, are insightful, improving our understanding of the coevolution of the WPE coupling system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000639853400073,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B125892%26rft.atitle%3DSystem%2Bdynamics%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bthe%2Bcoevolution%2Bof%2Bcoupled%2Bwater%2Bsupply-power%2Bgeneration-environment%2Bsystems%253A%2BUpper%2BYangtze%2Briver%2BBasin%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DBenjun%26rft.auinit%3DBJ%26rft.aulast%3DJia%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.125892%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D593%26rft.au%3DJia%252C%2BBJ%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BJZ%26rft.au%3DDing%252C%2BXL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
15,"Lu, Q",Oct 2022 ,Coupling Relationship and Influencing Factors of the Water-Energy-Cotton System in Tarim River Basin,AGRONOMY-BASEL,"As the largest inland river basin in China, the Tarim River Basin is an important energy base and a key cotton-producing area in China. Therefore, the harmonious development of water resources, energy resources and cotton resources in the Tarim River Basin is a lifeline for stable quality and efficient development in this region. In this paper, the water-energy-cotton system of the Tarim River Basin is constructed and the weight of each index in the system is determined by using the entropy method. On this basis, the comprehensive development index of each subsystem and the water-energy-cotton system is calculated to measure the comprehensive development level of each system. Then, the coupling relationship between the three resources is quantitatively analyzed by using the coupling coordination degree model, and the mutual influence and strength of interaction between each system are calculated. Finally, a fractional regression model is established to analyze the factors affecting the coordinated development of the water-energy-cotton system in the Tarim River Basin. The results show that the comprehensive development index of the Tarim River Basin fluctuates obviously and the comprehensive development level of water resource systems is higher than that of the cotton resource and energy resource systems, and there are regional differences between each subsystem and the comprehensive development index of water-energy-cotton system. The coupling coordination degree of the basin is the primary coordination on the whole; however, there are significant differences in the coupling coordination degree of each region. In terms of influencing factors, the area of soil erosion treatment and water consumption in ecological environments both play a positive role in promoting the coupling coordination degree, and population size and GDP will hinder the development of the coupling coordination degree to a certain extent.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000874136900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2333%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BRelationship%2Band%2BInfluencing%2BFactors%2Bof%2Bthe%2BWater-Energy-Cotton%2BSystem%2Bin%2BTarim%2BRiver%2BBasin%26rft.aufirst%3DQuan%26rft.auinit%3DQ%26rft.aulast%3DLu%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fagronomy12102333%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4395%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DAGRONOMY-BASEL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAGRONOMY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BQ%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BYX%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BDZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=AGRONOMY-BASEL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
16,"Turner, PA",Aug 11 2015 ,Indirect nitrous oxide emissions from streams within the US Corn Belt scale with stream order,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"N2O is an important greenhouse gas and the primary stratospheric ozone depleting substance. Its deleterious effects on the environment have prompted appeals to regulate emissions from agriculture, which represents the primary anthropogenic source in the global N2O budget. Successful implementation of mitigation strategies requires robust bottom-up inventories that are based on emission factors (EFs), simulation models, or a combination of the two. Top-down emission estimates, based on tall-tower and aircraft observations, indicate that bottom-up inventories severely underestimate regional and continental scale N2O emissions, implying that EFs may be biased low. Here, we measured N2O emissions from streams within the US Corn Belt using a chamber-based approach and analyzed the data as a function of Strahler stream order (S). N2O fluxes from headwater streams often exceeded 29 nmol N2O-N m(-2).s(-1) and decreased exponentially as a function of S. This relation was used to scale up riverine emissions and to assess the differences between bottom-up and top-down emission inventories at the local to regional scale. We found that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indirect EF for rivers (EF5r) is underestimated up to ninefold in southern Minnesota, which translates to a total tier 1 agricultural underestimation of N2O emissions by 40%. We show that accounting for zero-order streams as potential N2O hotspots can more than double the agricultural budget. Applying the same analysis to the US Corn Belt demonstrates that the IPCC EF5r underestimation explains the large differences observed between top-down and bottom-up emission estimates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000359285100039,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIndirect%2Bnitrous%2Boxide%2Bemissions%2Bfrom%2Bstreams%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2BUS%2BCorn%2BBelt%2Bscale%2Bwith%2Bstream%2Border%26rft.aufirst%3DPeter%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DPA%26rft.aulast%3DTurner%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1073%252Fpnas.1503598112%26rft.epage%3D9843%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0027-8424%26rft.issue%3D32%26rft.jtitle%3DPROCEEDINGS%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNATIONAL%2BACADEMY%2BOF%2BSCIENCES%2BOF%2BTHE%2BUNITED%2BSTATES%2BOF%2BAMERICA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D9839-9843%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D9839%26rft.stitle%3DP%2BNATL%2BACAD%2BSCI%2BUSA%26rft.volume%3D112%26rft.au%3DTurner%252C%2BPA%26rft.au%3DGriffis%252C%2BTJ%26rft.au%3DWood%252C%2BJD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=PROCEEDINGS+OF+THE+NATIONAL+ACADEMY+OF+SCIENCES+OF+THE+UNITED+STATES+OF+AMERICA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"McPherron, RL",Jul 2013 ,"Changes in solar wind-magnetosphere coupling with solar cycle, season, and time relative to stream interfaces",JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS,"Geomagnetic activity depends on a variety of factors including solar zenith angle, solar UV, strength of the interplanetary magnetic field, speed and density of the solar wind, orientation of the Earth's dipole, distance of the Earth from Sun, occurrence of CMEs and CIRs, and possibly other parameters. We have investigated some of these using state-dependant linear prediction filters. For a given state a prediction filter transforms a coupling function such as rectified solar wind electric field (VBs) to an output like the auroral electrojet index (AL). The area of this filter calculated from the sum of the filter coefficients measures the strength of the coupling. When the input and output are steady for a time longer than the duration of the filter the ratio of output to input is equal to this area. We find coupling strength defined in this way for Es=VBs to AL (and AU) is weakest at solar maximum and strongest at solar minimum. AL coupling displays a semiannual variation being weakest at the solstices and strongest at the equinoxes. AU coupling has only an annual variation being strongest at summer solstice. AL and AU coupling also vary with time relative to a stream interface. Es coupling is weaker after the interface, but ULF coupling is stronger. Total prediction efficiency remains about constant at the interface. The change in coupling strength with the solar cycle can be explained as an effect of more frequent saturation of the polar cap potential causing a smaller ratio of AL to Es. Stronger AL coupling at the equinoxes possibly indicates some process that makes magnetic reconnection less efficient when the dipole axis is tilted along the Earth-Sun line. Strong AU coupling at summer solstice is likely due to high conductivity in northern summer. Coupling changes at a stream interface are correlated with the presence of strong wave activity in ground and satellite measurements and may be an artifact of the method by which solar wind data are propagated.

Therefore, this paper aims to construct a co-evolution model to establish the mutual feedback relationship among society, water resources, and environment from the perspective of socio-hydrology. Firstly, social factors such as environmental sensitivity, environmental protection awareness, and technological level are introduced to this model to describe the coevolutionary trajectory of society, water resources and environment subsystems. Then, this model is implemented in 11 provincial administrative regions in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and the degree of coordination of their coupling is evaluated. Results show that the water-use efficiency of each provincial administrative region in the Yangtze River Economic Belt gradually increases during the forecast period. The coupling-coordinated degree of each provincial administrative region of the Yangtze River Economic Belt has greatly improved during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, reflecting that policy support has played a significant role in the coordinated development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The dynamic fluctuation process of environmental sensitivity effectively depicts the co-evolution process of the coupling system, which provides a reference for the subsequent exploration and cognition of the human-water coevolutionary mechanism.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000840217200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2449%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BCoevolution%2BModel%2Bof%2Bthe%2BCoupled%2BSociety-Water%2BResources-Environment%2BSystems%253A%2BAn%2BApplication%2Bin%2Ba%2BCase%2BStudy%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DHaoyuan%26rft.auinit%3DHY%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw14152449%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D15%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BHY%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DXia%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Dragun, Z",Aug 2022 ,Temperate Urban Streams as Summer-Critical Ecosystems Regarding Metal Contamination,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"Urbanization leads to changes in the natural state of the environment, including changes in natural aquatic habitats within urbanized zones. In the present study, the impact of urbanization on the water quality of urban streams, which are important sources of drinking water and recreational areas for the urban population, was investigated along two streams in the Croatian capital Zagreb. The upper reaches of the two urban streams are largely pristine (located within a nature park), whereas their downstream reaches are physically altered and impacted by anthropogenic (residential, municipal, industrial, agricultural) activities. Several physico-chemical parameters were measured in the streams using standardized methods, while concentrations of 30 dissolved metals/metalloids in the water were measured using a high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer. Although the water quality of the streams studied was rather good, the influence of urbanization was evident. Different contamination levels were observed along the two streams, depending on the specific anthropogenic activities and contamination increase in the stream reaches closer to the city centre. Furthermore, the summer season of low water levels and water discharges proved to be the most critical time, with significant increases in many metals/metalloids in the water. Since stream quality evidently reflects urbanization, continuous monitoring of urban streams is recommended, especially during the warmer seasons. The results of this study could help to understand the effects of the ""urban stream syndrome"" along urban streams and its seasonal characteristics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000832675900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B314%26rft.atitle%3DTemperate%2BUrban%2BStreams%2Bas%2BSummer-Critical%2BEcosystems%2BRegarding%2BMetal%2BContamination%26rft.aufirst%3DZrinka%26rft.auinit%3DZ%26rft.aulast%3DDragun%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11270-022-05774-8%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2932%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0049-6979%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BAND%2BSOIL%2BPOLLUTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BSOIL%2BPOLL%26rft.volume%3D233%26rft.au%3DDragun%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DPeric%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DKepcija%252C%2BRM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=WATER+AIR+AND+SOIL+POLLUTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Meire, D",Oct 2010 ,Modelling river-floodplain interaction during flood propagation,NATURAL HAZARDS,"The (re)integration of flood storage areas in the river system is considered and proved as an effective flood protection measure. By their (controlled) filling and emptying, inundation risks for downstream areas with higher vulnerability can be reduced. They have an influence not only on the flood level, but also on the residence time of the water in the river ecosystem, which is an important biological parameter. A good prediction of storage flow is therefore necessary in an integrated ecosystem model. In such a model, which is being developed by the universities of Ghent and Antwerp, hydraulic, biological and biogeochemical processes are coupled. In this paper, a one-dimensional hydrodynamic module of the integrated STRIVE (STReam RIVer Ecosystem) model, which is based on the de Saint-Venant equations and solved by the Preissmann scheme, is adapted to be able to include flow exchange with storage cells. This model is validated with experimental laboratory measurements on a small scale. The flow between the storage cells and the river is controlled by weirs (flooded river banks). Model simulations with STRIVE are also compared with HEC-RAS simulations. Good agreement between simulations of both models and between the STRIVE simulations and the measurements is found.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000282829500009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModelling%2Briver-floodplain%2Binteraction%2Bduring%2Bflood%2Bpropagation%26rft.aufirst%3DD.%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DMeire%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11069-010-9554-1%26rft.epage%3D121%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0921-030X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURAL%2BHAZARDS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D111-121%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D111%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BHAZARDS%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DMeire%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DDe%2BDoncker%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DVerhoeven%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=NATURAL+HAZARDS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Kadhim, AA",Dec 2021 ,Causes and consequences of environmental degradation along the Shatt Al-Arab River: a coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) perspective,GEOJOURNAL,"The Shatt Al-Arab River region (SARR) in Iraq was an economically important area for food production. By the 1970s the environment of this region had begun to deteriorate, and since then the SARR has suffered from severe human- and natural-induced problems. In this study we use a coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) perspective to identify these problems, their interconnections, and the degree to which human or natural systems have contributed to environmental degradation. We used several measures of ecological, economic and social systems to quantify the problems and document changes over the past five decades. The SARR has experienced significant climatological changes from 1975 to 2017, including lower precipitation and humidity, and increases in temperature and sea level, which affected the salinity of groundwater and river water. Human systems in the SARR also experienced tremendous stresses, including war and economic sanctions. We calculated and analyzed changes in vegetation via NDVI classification of Landsat imagery for five dates between 1975 and 2017 to understand how the environment has been affected. Changes in climatological variables were associated with lower NDVI throughout the region. However, vegetation decreased on the Iraqi side of the river, while it increased slightly on the Iranian side. This drop appears related to higher salinity in both surface and groundwater in Iraq, while irrigation from less saline water has maintained more consistent vegetation in Iran, suggesting that hydrologic diversion may be driving distinct trajectories for land use and vegetation on either side of the Shatt Al-Arab River.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000534434400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCauses%2Band%2Bconsequences%2Bof%2Benvironmental%2Bdegradation%2Balong%2Bthe%2BShatt%2BAl-Arab%2BRiver%253A%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2Bhuman%2Band%2Bnatural%2Bsystems%2B%2528CHANS%2529%2Bperspective%26rft.aufirst%3DAmeen%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DAA%26rft.aulast%3DKadhim%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10708-020-10225-0%26rft.eissn%3D1572-9893%26rft.epage%3D2722%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0343-2521%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2709-2722%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2709%26rft.stitle%3DGEOJOURNAL%26rft.volume%3D86%26rft.au%3DKadhim%252C%2BAA%26rft.au%3DShortridge%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DAl-Nasrawi%252C%2BAKM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=GEOJOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Saturation was achieved with NaCl brines with salinities ranging from 2 x 10(-3) to 2.0 mol L-1. The magnitude of the coupling coefficient increased with decreasing salinity, similarly to the trend observed for sandstones. The permeability had a low impact on the values of the streaming potential coupling coefficient at high and low salinity. The zeta potential was calculated at full saturation using a modified version of the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation that accounts for surface electrical conductivity. Under atmospheric conditions, the magnitude of the zeta potential decreased with the increase in salinity. We also explored the relationships between the streaming potential coupling coefficient and water saturation in three partially saturated limestones using a steady-state flow experiment. We found good agreement between the van Genuchten approach and experimental data, and fitted both the relative permeability and capillary pressure curves with the same value of the van Genuchten exponent m(v).

23,"Zhang, XQ",,Flow prediction in the lower Yellow River based on CEEMDAN-BiLSTM coupled model,WATER SUPPLY,"As one of the important hydrological elements of rivers, flow is of great significance to the development and utilization of water resources and the ecological environment. Based on the excellent nonlinear processing capability of CEEMDAN and the advantages of BILSTM in time -series data modeling, a coupled CEEMDAN-BILSTM model is constructed for flow prediction, and the I-month flows from 1951-2016 are used to predict the i-month flows from 2017-2021. The results show that the CEEMDAN-BILSTM coupled model predicts the trend more closely with the actual data variation, and the minimum relative error is 0.56 and maximum 9.48, which are maintained within 10%, and the deter-ministic coefficients are all greater than 0.9, so the prediction accuracy is high. The flow in month I of 5 years was picked up by monthly predictions for 66 consecutive years, which provides a new way of thinking about the prediction of river flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000899869700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFlow%2Bprediction%2Bin%2Bthe%2Blower%2BYellow%2BRiver%2Bbased%2Bon%2BCEEMDAN-BiLSTM%2Bcoupled%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DXianqi%26rft.auinit%3DXQ%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fws.2022.426%26rft.eissn%3D1607-0798%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1606-9749%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BSUPPLY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BSUPPLY%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BXQ%26rft.au%3DQiao%252C%2BWB%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BMH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=WATER+SUPPLY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

It is found that the electron diffraction effect significantly alters the instability growth rate in a wide range of plasma number density. Two cases of classical and quantum Landau quantization limits are compared and the parametric instability condition is closely inspected. It is remarked that for a given streaming speed the instability is bounded by an upper plasma number-density limit. It is also shown that for a given stream speed there is a maximal growth rate corresponding to specific plasma number-density and perturbation wavelength. Current study can help in better understanding of electron-beam plasma interactions and energy exchange for a wide area of number densities ranging from solid density, inertial confined plasmas, big planetary cores and compact stars. It may also be useful in understanding of electrostatic beam-plasma interactions and origin of large magnitude sustainable electrical currents in super-intense plasmas with critically high magnetic fields such as, pulsars, white dwarf interiors and neutron star crusts.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000382146100030,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B307%26rft.atitle%3DElectrostatic%2Btwo-stream%2Binstability%2Bin%2BFermi-Dirac%2Bplasmas%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DAkbari-Moghanjoughi%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10509-016-2889-7%26rft.eissn%3D1572-946X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0004-640X%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DASTROPHYSICS%2BAND%2BSPACE%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DASTROPHYS%2BSPACE%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D361%26rft.au%3DAkbari-Moghanjoughi%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DMohammadnejad%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DEsfandyari-Kalejahi%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=ASTROPHYSICS+AND+SPACE+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
25,"Splinter, DK",Oct 1 2010 ,Ecoregions and stream morphology in eastern Oklahoma,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Broad-scale variables (i.e., geology, topography, climate, land use, vegetation, and soils) influence channel morphology. How and to what extent the longitudinal pattern of channel morphology is influenced by broad-scale variables is important to fluvial geomorphologists and stream ecologists. In the last couple of decades, there has been an increase in the amount of interdisciplinary research between fluvial geomorphologists and stream ecologists. In a historical context, fluvial geomorphologists are more apt to use physiographic regions to distinguish broad-scale variables, while stream ecologists are more apt to use the concept of an ecosystem to address the broad-scale variables that influence stream habitat. For this reason, we designed a study using ecoregions, which uses physical and biological variables to understand how landscapes influence channel processes. Ecoregions are delineated by similarities in geology, climate, soils, land use, and potential natural vegetation. In the fluvial system, stream form and function are dictated by processes observed throughout the fluvial hierarchy. Recognizing that stream form and function should differ by ecoregion, a study was designed to evaluate how the characteristics of stream channels differed longitudinally among three ecoregions in eastern Oklahoma, USA: Boston Mountains, Ozark Highlands, and Ouachita Mountains. Channel morphology of 149 stream reaches was surveyed in 1st-through 4th-order streams, and effects of drainage area and ecoregion on channel morphology was evaluated using multiple regressions. Differences existed (alpha <= 0.05) among ecoregions for particle size, bankfull width, and width/depth ratio. No differences existed among ecoregions for gradient or sinuosity. Particle size was smallest in the Ozark Highlands and largest in the Ouachita Mountains. Bankfull width was larger in the Ozark Highlands than in the Boston Mountains and Ouachita Mountains in larger streams. Width/depth ratios of the Boston Mountains and Ozark Highlands were not statistically different. Significant differences existed, however, between the Boston Mountains and Ozark Highlands when compared individually to the Ouachita Mountains. We found that ecoregions afforded a good spatial structure that can help in understanding longitudinal trends in stream reach morphology surveyed at the reach scale. The hierarchy of the fluvial system begins within a broad, relatively homogenous setting that imparts control on processes that affect stream function. Ecoregions provide an adequate regional division to begin a large-scale geomorphic study of processes in stream channels. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We formulate a scaling law to predict the bit and block error rate of periodically-doped semi-infinite SC-LDPC code ensembles streamed over the binary erasure channel under sliding window decoding for a given finite component block length. The scaling law assumes that with some probability doping is equivalent to full termination and triggers two decoding waves; otherwise, decoding performs as if the coupled chain had not been doped at all. We approximate that probability and use the derived scaling laws to predict the error rates of SC-LDPC code ensembles in the presence of doping. The proposed scaling law provides accurate error rate predictions. We further use it to show that in streaming applications periodic doping can yield higher rates than periodic full termination for the same error-correcting performance.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000677525300006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2BDoped%2BSC-LDPC%2BCodes%2Bfor%2BStreaming%26rft.aufirst%3DRoman%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DSokolovskii%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FLCOMM.2021.3069628%26rft.eissn%3D1558-2558%26rft.epage%3D2127%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1089-7798%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2123-2127%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2123%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BCOMMUN%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DSokolovskii%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DAmat%252C%2BAGI%26rft.au%3DBrannstrom%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=IEEE+COMMUNICATIONS+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The chaotic pseudorandom bit generator (PRBG) based on a coupled NDF, which is constructed in an inverse flow, can generate multiple bits at one iteration and satisfy the security requirement of cipher design. Then, the stream cipher is employed to generate cancelable competitive code palmprint biometrics for template protection. The proposed cancelable palmprint authentication system depends on two factors: the palmprint biometric and the password/token. Therefore, the system provides high-confidence and also protects the user's privacy. The experimental results of verification on the Hong Kong PolyU Palmprint Database show that the proposed approach has a large template re-issuance ability and the equal error rate can achieve 0.02%.

28,"Walrath, JD",2016 ,Influence of Stream Condition on Habitat Diversity and Fish Assemblages in an Impaired Upper Snake River Basin Watershed,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,"Habitat diversity reflects the range of available habitats used by species with different niche requirements and, therefore, influences species diversity. Land use influences stream condition, and streams in poor condition are often wide, shallow, sediment-laden channels with low instream habitat diversity. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of instream habitat diversity on fish species diversity, the effect of stream habitat condition on habitat diversity, and the effect of habitat diversity, stream condition, and other natural stream features on fish assemblage structure (proportional abundance) in an impaired upper Snake River basin watershed containing a locally diverse but regionally depauperate species pool. We sampled fishes and instream and riparian habitat at 41 sites, focusing on measures of instream habitat diversity and the following stream condition indicators: livestock trails on streambanks, streambank stability, channel width-to-depth ratio, percent fine substrates, and woody riparian vegetation. Multiple regression revealed that fish species diversity was positively associated with all four components of habitat diversity, that is, diversity in substrate, cover, water depth, and water velocity (P < 0.09, adjusted R-2 = 0.642). All four components of habitat diversity increased with stream size, and each component was negatively but weakly associated with at least one stream condition indicator (P < 0.10, adjusted R-2 = 0.23 to 0.61). Fish assemblage structure was influenced primarily by natural stream features (gradient, temperature) and secondarily by stream condition indicators and streamflow diversity. Our results connect fish species diversity increases in larger streams with concomitant increases in four dimensions of instream habitat diversity. The findings show how stream condition reflecting land uses, such as riparian over-grazing, can negatively impact habitat diversity within that stream-size continuum, thus emphasizing the role land management plays in maintaining fish species diversity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000379596200013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2BStream%2BCondition%2Bon%2BHabitat%2BDiversity%2Band%2BFish%2BAssemblages%2Bin%2Ban%2BImpaired%2BUpper%2BSnake%2BRiver%2BBasin%2BWatershed%26rft.aufirst%3DJohn%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DWalrath%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F00028487.2016.1159613%26rft.eissn%3D1548-8659%26rft.epage%3D834%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0002-8487%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DTRANSACTIONS%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BFISHERIES%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D821-834%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D821%26rft.stitle%3DT%2BAM%2BFISH%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D145%26rft.au%3DWalrath%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DDauwalter%252C%2BDC%26rft.au%3DReinke%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=TRANSACTIONS+OF+THE+AMERICAN+FISHERIES+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Transport vectors that contribute to the introduction and the rapid spread of alien species are river shipping, deliberate crayfish and fish stocking, pet trade, release from aquaria, and food consumption. The invasions of the studied species have a potential to alter the structure and the function of Danubian ecosystems and create new biodiversity and economic problems.

30,"Sabo, JL",Apr 14 2012 ,A network theory for resource exchange between rivers and their watersheds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Watersheds are drained by river networks, which route materials and energy from headwaters to terminal water bodies. River networks likewise perfuse the terrestrial portion of watershed ecosystems and reroute some of these materials upslope via material exchange between rivers and land. Here we develop a model of resource exchange between rivers and watersheds to predict the spatial extent of material and nutrient fluxes from aquatic portions of watershed ecosystems. The model is based on a geomorphic template that includes river network structure, topography, and channel sinuosity as well as important biological attributes (productivity and dispersal ability). Analysis of this model suggests that the geomorphic template strongly influences the spatial extent of resource flows in watershed ecosystems. The geomorphic template also predicts the location of areas of concentrated resource exchange, typically at ridge crests, in meander bends, and tributary junctions. We contend that these areas represent hotspots of foraging activity for terrestrial consumers, especially those at the reach scale (meander bends). More generally, our model suggests that the spatial extent of aquatic resource flow equal in magnitude to 20% or greater of terrestrial production may encompass as much as 20%-50% of terrestrial portions of watersheds. Resource flow from rivers to terrestrial ecosystems is not merely an edge effect. Instead, the river network may reroute a substantial flux of materials into watershed ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000302874800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW04515%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bnetwork%2Btheory%2Bfor%2Bresource%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Brivers%2Band%2Btheir%2Bwatersheds%26rft.aufirst%3DJohn%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DSabo%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR010703%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DSabo%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DHagen%252C%2BEM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
31,"Papangelakis, E",Aug 1 2022 ,Testing a Watershed-Scale Stream Power Index Tool for Erosion Risk Assessment in an Urban River,JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT,"Successful watershed planning requires a watershed-scale approach to the assessment of erosion hazards. Stream power, or the rate of energy expenditure of flowing water, is a driver of river erosion and morphologic change. Stream Power Index for Networks (SPIN) is a newly developed geographic information system (GIS)-based toolbox that uses simple inputs to calculate total stream power, specific stream power, and their change between past, present, and future land-use conditions. We tested the ability of SPIN to identify areas of erosion risk by comparing its outputs against an independent database of erosion mitigation sites in an urban river. Objectives were to (1) validate the channel slope and threshold particle size calculated by the toolbox against data collected from field sites, (2) assess the utility of the toolbox outputs for interpreting spatial patterns of erosion control structure construction and maintenance, and (3) evaluate how the toolbox can be used to support or enhance current erosion monitoring techniques. Channel slope and threshold substrate size values calculated by SPIN matched those measured in the watershed. Both total and specific stream power increased between the rural (preurban) and urban land-use conditions, and maps generated by the toolbox provided a visual assessment of areas of expected erosion risk. The density of erosion control structures increased with total and specific stream power, and threshold stream power ratio values were identified above which erosion control structures were widespread. Stream power indices were also related to the condition of erosion control structures when defined as the distance between the channel erosion and the infrastructure.

32,"Sun, XL",Apr 2018 ,Using SWAT-LUD Model to Estimate the Influence of Water Exchange and Shallow Aquifer Denitrification on Water and Nitrate Flux,WATER,Numerous studies have pointed out the importance of groundwater and surface water interaction (SW-GW) in a river system. However; those functions have rarely been considered in large scale hydrological models. The SWAT-LUD model has been developed based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model; and it integrates a new type of subbasin; which is called subbasin-LU (SL); to represent the floodplain area. New modules representing SW-GW exchanges and shallow aquifer denitrification are developed in the SWAT-LUD model. In this study; the SWAT-LUD model was applied to the middle floodplain area of the Garonne catchment in France. The results showed that the SWAT-LUD model could represent the SW-GW exchange and shallow aquifer denitrification appropriately. An annual 44.1 x 10(7) m(3) of water flowed into the river from the study area; but the annual exchanged water volume was 6.4 x 10(7) m(3); which represented just 1% of the river discharge. A total of 384 tons of N-NO3- (0.023 t-ha(-1)) was consumed by denitrification in the floodplain shallow aquifer annually. The nitrate concentration (N-NO3-) decrease in the channel was 0.12 mg.L-1; but in the shallow aquifer it reached 11.40 mg-L-1; 8.05 mg.L-1; and 5.41 mg.L-1 in LU1; LU2; and LU3; respectively. Our study reveals that; in the Garonne floodplain; denitrification plays a significant role in the attenuation of nitrate associated with groundwater; but the impacts of denitrification on nitrate associated with river water is much less significant.Show less,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434954900182,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B528%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2BSWAT-LUD%2BModel%2Bto%2BEstimate%2Bthe%2BInfluence%2Bof%2BWater%2BExchange%2Band%2BShallow%2BAquifer%2BDenitrification%2Bon%2BWater%2Band%2BNitrate%2BFlux%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaoling%26rft.auinit%3DXL%26rft.aulast%3DSun%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw10040528%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DSun%252C%2BXL%26rft.au%3DBernard-Jannin%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DPerez%252C%2BJMS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
33,"Sobotka, MJ",Jul 2017 ,A Comparison of Metabolic Rates in Off-Channel Habitats of the Middle Mississippi River,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Autochthonous material has been found to be an important base in large river food webs. However, a spatial understanding of primary production in large rivers is lacking. We modeled primary productivity and community respiration (CR) during a low water period in two types of off-channel habitat present in the Middle Mississippi River, side channels and wing dike fields. Wing dike fields are constantly connected to the main channel and are well mixed along most of their length, while side channels are typically connected only at the top and mouth. Gross primary production (GPP) in wing dike fields ranged from 0.0 to 8.9gO(2)m(-2)D(-1) and in side channels GPP ranged from 0.4 to 33.5gO(2)m(-2)D(-1). Both habitat types experienced periods of positive net ecosystem production (NEP) especially in the late summer and early fall. Correlations between metabolic rates and ecosystem characteristics differed between habitat types. Discharge was negatively correlated to NEP in wing dike fields but was not associated with metabolic rates in side channels. Light was positively correlated with GPP and CR at both site types and with NEP in side channels. These areas are protected from high velocity and likely experience greater light penetration, allowing more photosynthesis to take place especially during low water periods. This study demonstrates the potential for high productivity in off-channel habitats that are permanently connected to the main channel.

34,"Sullivan, SMP",Jun 2013 ,Stream foodweb delta C-13 and geomorphology are tightly coupled in mountain drainages of northern Idaho,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The relative influence of landscape vs local processes on variation in stream C and energy sources to lotic consumers remains unresolved, but is a key component in understanding pathways through stream food webs. I investigated potential linkages between the distribution of delta C-13 signatures of primary producers (periphyton), terrestrial organic matter (detritus), and secondary consumers (aquatic invertebrates and fish) and: 1) drainage area and 2) stream reach geomorphology in 3 mountain watersheds of northern Idaho, USA. When considered alone, drainage area explained variation in the delta C-13 signatures of periphyton (R-2 = 0.30) and sculpin (R-2 = 0.15) only. Subsequent General Linear Models (GLMs) showed that stream morphology explained significant variation in delta C-13 of periphyton (79%), Diptera (93%), sculpin (51%), and trout (63%). Drainage area was not significant in these models, a result indicating that once delta C-13 signatures are explained as a function of geomorphic type, the contribution of drainage area becomes less important. On the whole, consumer delta C-13 signatures related more strongly to periphyton delta C-13 than detrital delta C-13, though this relationship varied among geomorphic types. Collectively, results indicate that the morphology of a stream reach (including factors such as substrate size and storage elements, floodplain development, etc.) may be an important factor in the assimilation and distribution of C in food webs in forested mountain streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000318774500020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStream%2Bfoodweb%2Bdelta%2BC-13%2Band%2Bgeomorphology%2Bare%2Btightly%2Bcoupled%2Bin%2Bmountain%2Bdrainages%2Bof%2Bnorthern%2BIdaho%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%2BMazeika%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DSMP%26rft.aulast%3DSullivan%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F12-101.1%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D621%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D606-621%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D606%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D32&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
35,"Ma, B",Dec 2020 ,Evaluation of impact of spur dike designs on enhancement of aquatic habitats in urban streams using 2D habitat numerical simulations,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Although channelized urban streams provide aesthetic and economic value, they reduce biodiversity and alter the habitats of aquatic organisms. Spur dikes not only prevent the erosion of riverbanks, but also generally improve aquatic habitats. River 2D is widely used to analyze the aquatic habitats. However, the model often faces a challenge of lacking sediment and riverbed evolution module, which is difficult to predict the change of aquatic habitats. In this study, a depth-averaged habitat model, which couples a two-dimensional water-sediment shallow water model with an Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM), was provided to evaluate the impact of spur dikes on the improvement of aquatic habitats in the Jinjiang Stream in Chengdu, China.The potential value of aquatic habitats was quantitatively evaluated by a weighted useable area (WUA). Under different spur dike scenarios, the WUA is greater than under natural conditions, that is, the construction of spur dikes is beneficial for improving the habitat of aquatic organisms in urban rivers. In addition, further analysis from the simulation results shows that the three-spur dike scenario with a flow of 40 m(3)/s represents the best layout of spur dikes. Our study indicates that adjusting the spur dike layout is an effective instrument to enhance aquatic habitats, and can provide a certain reference for water ecological restoration and river management.

36,"Wang, YZ",Feb 24 2017 ,"Coupling slope-area analysis, integral approach and statistic tests to steady-state bedrock river profile analysis",EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS,"Slope-area analysis and the integral approach have both been widely used in stream profile analysis. The former is better at identifying changes in concavity indices but produces stream power parameters with high uncertainties relative to the integral approach. The latter is much better for calculating channel steepness. Limited work has been done to couple the advantages of the two methods and to remedy such drawbacks. Here we show the merit of the log-transformed slope-area plot to determine changes in concavities and then to identify colluvial, bedrock and alluvial channels along river profiles. Via the integral approach, we obtain bedrock channel concavity and steepness with high precision. In addition, we run bivariant linear regression statistic tests for the two methods to examine and eliminate serially correlated residuals because they may bias both the estimated value and the precision of stream power parameters. We finally suggest that the coupled process, integrating the advantages of both slope-area analysis and the integral approach, can be a more robust and capable method for bedrock river profile analysis.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000395375700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bslope-area%2Banalysis%252C%2Bintegral%2Bapproach%2Band%2Bstatistic%2Btests%2Bto%2Bsteady-state%2Bbedrock%2Briver%2Bprofile%2Banalysis%26rft.aufirst%3DYizhou%26rft.auinit%3DYZ%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fesurf-5-145-2017%26rft.eissn%3D2196-632X%26rft.epage%3D16%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2196-6311%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DEARTH%2BSURFACE%2BDYNAMICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1-16%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1%26rft.stitle%3DEARTH%2BSURF%2BDYNAM%26rft.volume%3D5%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BYZ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BHP%26rft.au%3DMa%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=EARTH+SURFACE+DYNAMICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
37,"Menniti, CM",Jun 2020 ,The Importance of Offshore Exchange for Water Temperatures in Norwalk Harbor,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,"The Norwalk Harbor is the estuarine portion of the Norwalk River, which connects to Long Island Sound. Like many embayments, this macrotidal harbor experiences higher summer water temperatures than waters farther offshore, which contribute to water quality problems. The summer season is characterized by surface heating, strong tides (as in all seasons), weak winds, and low river discharge. To determine the relative importance of exchange with offshore waters in regulating the harbor temperature, a control volume approach is used to make a summer temperature budget for the harbor based on observations. Time series of harbor temperature, surface heat flux, and Norwalk River inflow are constrained with measurements of water temperatures, atmospheric conditions, and river discharge. The impact of offshore exchange is inferred as the residual after the real temperature change in the harbor, and all other sources of temperature change are constrained. The analysis indicates that, in the summer, the impact of offshore exchange is comparable to the impact of the surface heat flux and far greater than the impact of the river. Consequently, the harbor is much cooler during summer than it would be if it was not connected to Long Island Sound. The methods applied here are applicable to any relatively small, semi-enclosed body of water and do not require the use of models or velocity observations. It is likely that many other embayments have an appreciable degree of thermal buffering via exchange with offshore waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000523058100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BImportance%2Bof%2BOffshore%2BExchange%2Bfor%2BWater%2BTemperatures%2Bin%2BNorwalk%2BHarbor%26rft.aufirst%3DChristina%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DCM%26rft.aulast%3DMenniti%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12237-020-00710-7%26rft.eissn%3D1559-2731%26rft.epage%3D800%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1559-2723%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DESTUARIES%2BAND%2BCOASTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D787-800%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D787%26rft.stitle%3DESTUAR%2BCOAST%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DMenniti%252C%2BCM%26rft.au%3DWhitney%252C%2BMM%26rft.au%3DDeignan-Schmidt%252C%2BSR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=ESTUARIES+AND+COASTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

39,"Faz, U",Apr 2021 ,A Coupled-Cavity Resonator Technique for Simultaneous Sensing of Dielectric Load and Position of Continuous Material Streams,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES,"An electromagnetic coupled-cavity resonator equipped with permanent insertion holes and designed to sense continuous dielectric material streams through the resonator is presented. The resonating structure comprises a pair of pill-box-shaped cylindrical cavities mutually coupled to each other through an aperture-loaded metal sheet of finite thickness. The input and output insertion holes in the top and bottom lids of the cavity structure form a channel for the flow of dielectric samples under test. The arrangement of aperture-coupled cavity sections results in antisymmetric and symmetric field distributions with split resonances. The resonating antisymmetric field is primarily utilized to detect dielectric load variations of the sample stream, similar to the commonly practiced permittivity based measurements in TM010 cavities. The additional resonance mode with the symmetric field distribution is more sensitive to position offsets of the sample in its concentric flow along the axis. Due to the added resonance, the arrangement provides for 2-D sensing of dielectric specimens under test (dielectric load variation and position offset) and improved accuracy can, thus, be achieved. The working principle of the coupled-cavity technique is analyzed qualitatively by numerical computations. The technique is validated by measuring samples of commercially available cotton fibers with a realized prototype.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000637534400036,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BCoupled-Cavity%2BResonator%2BTechnique%2Bfor%2BSimultaneous%2BSensing%2Bof%2BDielectric%2BLoad%2Band%2BPosition%2Bof%2BContinuous%2BMaterial%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DUsman%26rft.auinit%3DU%26rft.aulast%3DFaz%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTMTT.2021.3058176%26rft.eissn%3D1557-9670%26rft.epage%3D2407%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-9480%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BMICROWAVE%2BTHEORY%2BAND%2BTECHNIQUES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2399-2407%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2399%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BMICROW%2BTHEORY%26rft.volume%3D69%26rft.au%3DFaz%252C%2BU%26rft.au%3DEibert%252C%2BTF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+MICROWAVE+THEORY+AND+TECHNIQUES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
40,"Shim, MJ",Feb 28 2017 ,"Floodplain effects on the transport of dissolved and colloidal trace elements in the East Pearl River, Mississippi",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Substantial work suggests that floodplain wetlands could play a role in modifying fluvial fluxes of dissolved and colloidal trace elements. Yet, few studies have directly addressed this issue. We examined trace elements in the East Pearl River (Mississippi or Louisiana, USA), which is surrounded by wetlands that are temporally more or less connected to the river depending on river stage. Dissolved and colloidal trace element samples, along with ancillary data, including dissolved organic carbon and nutrients, were collected during eight surveys of this system at different flow stages from November 2007 to September 2008. Hydrology of the system is complex due to seasonal changes in water sources as well as potential inputs from the floodplain wetlands and the hyporheic zone. We therefore considered effects including nonconservative mixing of water sources, saltwater intrusion, and floodplain wetland flux requirements needed to support observed downstream concentration changes. During moderately high discharge, fluxes of many elements (e.g., Cd, Fe, Mn, and Zn) increased downstream by 20% or more, with inputs from the floodplain wetlands as the apparent source. At the highest discharge, however, wetland inputs to the river may have been rate-limited (i.e., the wetland source was flushed faster than biogeochemical processes could regenerate dissolved or colloidal material). At low discharge, other effects, including saltwater intrusion and hyporheic zone interactions, are important. Both redox processes and organic ligands (or dissolved organic carbon), along with the supply of wetland inputs (or removal) relative to river fluxes, appear to be key factors determining floodplain wetland effects. While the behavior of some elements suggests they were dominantly affected by redox processes (Mn and V) or by organic complexation (dissolved Fe and light rare earths), other elements were affected by more than one process in ways that remain obscure (Cu). Overall our results are broadly consistent with previous field, laboratory, and modeling studies and suggest that a better understanding of the sources and transformations of Fe is a key area for future research.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394901800010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFloodplain%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bthe%2Btransport%2Bof%2Bdissolved%2Band%2Bcolloidal%2Btrace%2Belements%2Bin%2Bthe%2BEast%2BPearl%2BRiver%252C%2BMississippi%26rft.aufirst%3DMoo%2BJoon%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DShim%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.11093%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D1099%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1086-1099%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1086%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DShim%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DCai%252C%2BYH%26rft.au%3DShiller%252C%2BAM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Rassam, DW",Dec 2011 ,A conceptual framework for incorporating surface-groundwater interactions into a river operation-planning model,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"Groundwater discharge constitutes a significant proportion of the total flow volume in most rivers. The exchange flux between surface and groundwater greatly impacts the surface as well as the groundwater balance with serious implications on ecosystem health especially during low flow conditions. There is a move towards conjunctive river-aquifer management with the integration of surface-groundwater exchange fluxes into surface and groundwater models to manage water as a single resource. Groundwater-Surface water (GW-SW) exchange fluxes are seldom integrated into river operation and planning models. The time lags associated with the impacts of groundwater processes on nearby rivers can greatly compromise the forecasting capacity of river models especially during low flow conditions.This paper presents a conceptual framework for integrating GW-SW exchange fluxes into the new generation river operation-planning model 'Source Integrated Modelling System'. The proposed GW-SW Link Module adopts a simple pragmatic approach for estimating the exchange fluxes between a river reach and the underlying aquifer using explicit analytical solutions. This flux becomes an inflow/outflow to that river reach and forms part of the routing and calibration processes. The exchange flux comprises four components: (1) natural exchange flux resulting from river stage fluctuations during low flow conditions, within bank and overbank fluctuations; (2) flux due to groundwater extraction; (3) flux due to changes in aquifer recharge; and (4) flux due to changes in evapotranspiration. The sum of those components during every time step dictates whether the river loses water to or gains water from the aquifer.The proposed analytical solutions were found to provide flux predictions that agree favourably with those derived from a numerical groundwater model. Recognising that the simplifying assumptions that underpin the explicit analytical solution are likely to be violated in the natural world, a suite of criteria was recommended for their use under many violating conditions related to boundary conditions, head gradients, and aquifer heterogeneity. Low flow indices were adopted to demonstrate the critical role of GW-SW exchange flux when predicting river low flows. Explicit accounting of GW-SW interactions into river operation and planning models greatly enhances their forecasting capacity during low flow conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

42,"Gosselin, MP",Mar 2012 ,Mesohabitat use by brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a small groundwater-dominated stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Groundwater-dominated streams have particular flow regimes that commonly support populations of trout. Meso- and micro-habitat surveys were carried out on a reach of the river Tern that drains a Triassic sandstone aquifer in the English West Midlands, to investigate brown trout (Salmo trutta) habitat use with varying flows. Mesohabitats were mapped over a range of summer and autumn flows and coupled with direct underwater observation (snorkelling) of fish locations together with point measurements of velocity and depth. The number of habitat types recorded was low and dominated by glides, runs, and backwaters. Brown trout showed a strong association with glides and runs with adults being more associated with runs and parr with glides. General habitat use curves showed brown trout to favour depths between 0.30 and 0.40 m and velocities below 0.40 m s-1. A clear preference was shown for sand and gravel bed materials. However, the differentiation of hydraulic habitats was weak and there was no trend in mesohabitats or change in trout use of mesohabitats with discharge. The study raises limitations of the mesohabitat survey approach when linking fish ecology, flow and physical habitat in small streams with low flow variability and low habitat diversity. In these situations, other factors (especially cover features) appear to strongly influence brown trout distribution.

We apply the model to a 9 year record of discharge and stream chemistry from a small catchment in the Shenandoah National park of Virginia. We find that we are able to accurately predict the minimum daily stream alkalinity values for all years and we are able to accurately predict the entire annual cycle for 6 of the 9 years (Nash-Sutcliffe criterion equals 0.26).

44,"Gu, RC",Dec 1998 ,Quantifying the effects of stream discharge on summer river temperature,HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,"Control of summer river temperature is needed for maintaining water temperature standards to protect aquatic biota and wildlife habitats. Given the fact that instream discharge, among meteorological and hydrological factors, may be the only one that can be practically managed, is it feasible to moderate summer river temperature through reservoir and streamflow regulations? An analysis is conducted to quantify the effects of the magnitude of instream flow on summer river temperature with weather as a reference. Relationships between water temperature and river discharge or flow depth are developed using a simplified model and adopting the concept of equilibrium temperature and bulk surface heat exchange coefficient. The relationships are validated against continuous 5-year field measurements at the central Platte River, Nebraska, USA. It was found that the variation of daily maximum water temperature with now was stronger than that of daily mean. A critical discharge was obtained, which divides dramatic drop and slow variation in river temperature values. The existence of the critical discharge makes it possible to reduce or minimize the occurrence of daily maximum water temperature exceeding a standard at a river reach by increasing discharge to an achievable level. This study advances understanding of impacts of instream flow on summer river temperature and provides information useful in proper planning and design of reservoir operations and streamflow management.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000077425100005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DQuantifying%2Bthe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bdischarge%2Bon%2Bsummer%2Briver%2Btemperature%26rft.aufirst%3DRC%26rft.auinit%3DRC%26rft.aulast%3DGu%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F02626669809492185%26rft.epage%3D904%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0262-6667%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BSCIENCES%2BJOURNAL-JOURNAL%2BDES%2BSCIENCES%2BHYDROLOGIQUES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D885-904%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D885%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROLOG%2BSCI%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DGu%252C%2BRC%26rft.au%3DMontgomery%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DAl%2BAustin%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+SCIENCES+JOURNAL-JOURNAL+DES+SCIENCES+HYDROLOGIQUES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
45,"Danovich, M",May 2012 ,"Coplanar streams, pancakes and angular-momentum exchange in high-z disc galaxies",MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY,"We study the feeding of massive galaxies at high redshift through streams from the cosmic web using the Mare Nostrum hydrocosmological simulation. Our statistical sample consists of 350 dark matter haloes of similar or equal to 10(12) M-circle dot at z = 2.5. We find that similar to 70 per cent of the influx into the virial radius R-v is in narrow streams covering 10 per cent of the virial shell. On average 64 per cent of the stream influx is in one stream, and 95 per cent is in three dominant streams. The streams that feed a massive halo tend to lie in a plane that extends from half to a few R-v, hereafter 'the stream plane' (SP). The streams are typically embedded in a thin sheet of low-entropy gas, a Zel'dovich pancake, which carries similar to 20 per cent of the influx into R-v. The filaments-in-a-plane configuration about the massive haloes at the nodes of the cosmic web differs from the large-scale structure of the web where the filaments mark the intersections of slanted sheets. The SP is only weakly aligned with the angular momentum (AM) near R-v, consistent with the fact that typically 80 per cent of the AM is carried by one dominant stream. The galactic disc plane shows a weak tendency to be perpendicular to the large-scale SP, consistent with tidal-torque theory. Most interesting, the direction of the disc AM is only weakly correlated with the AM direction at R-v. This indicates a significant AM exchange at the interphase between streams and disc in the greater environment of the disc inside an 'AM sphere' of radius similar to 0.3R(v). The required large torques are expected based on the perturbed morphology and kinematics within this interaction sphere. This AM exchange may or may not require a major modification of the standard disc modelling based on AM conservation, depending on the extent to which the amplitude of the disc AM is affected, which is yet to be studied.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000303912800070,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoplanar%2Bstreams%252C%2Bpancakes%2Band%2Bangular-momentum%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bhigh-z%2Bdisc%2Bgalaxies%26rft.aufirst%3DMark%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DDanovich%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2966.2012.20751.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2966%26rft.epage%3D1749%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0035-8711%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DMONTHLY%2BNOTICES%2BOF%2BTHE%2BROYAL%2BASTRONOMICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1732-1749%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1732%26rft.stitle%3DMON%2BNOT%2BR%2BASTRON%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D422%26rft.au%3DDanovich%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DDekel%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DTeyssier%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=MONTHLY+NOTICES+OF+THE+ROYAL+ASTRONOMICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
46,"Merten, E",Oct 9 2010 ,Factors influencing wood mobilization in streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Natural pieces of wood provide a variety of ecosystem functions in streams including habitat, organic matter retention, increased hyporheic exchange and transient storage, and enhanced hydraulic and geomorphic heterogeneity. Wood mobilization is a critical process in determining the residence time of wood. We documented the characteristics and locations of 865 natural wood pieces (>0.05 m in diameter for a portion >1 m in length) in nine streams along the north shore of Lake Superior in Minnesota. We determined the locations of the pieces again after an overbank stormflow event to determine the factors that influenced mobilization of stationary wood pieces in natural streams. Seven of 11 potential predictor variables were identified with multiple logistic regression as significant to mobilization: burial, effective depth, ratio of piece length to effective stream width (length ratio), bracing, rootwad presence, downstream force ratio, and draft ratio. The final model (P < 0.001, r(2) = 0.39) indicated that wood mobilization under natural conditions is a complex function of both mechanical factors (burial, length ratio, bracing, rootwad presence, draft ratio) and hydraulic factors (effective depth, downstream force ratio). If stable pieces are a goal for stream management then features such as partial burial, low effective depth, high length relative to channel width, bracing against other objects (e. g., stream banks, trees, rocks, or larger wood pieces), and rootwads are desirable. Using the model equation from this study, stewards of natural resources can better manage in-stream wood for the benefit of stream ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000285012500003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW10514%26rft.atitle%3DFactors%2Binfluencing%2Bwood%2Bmobilization%2Bin%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DEric%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DMerten%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009WR008772%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DMerten%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DFinlay%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DVondracek%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
47,"Chen, SM",Feb 2021 ,Co-Bridges: Pair-wise Visual Connection and Comparison for Multi-item Data Streams,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS,"In various domains, there are abundant streams or sequences of multi-item data of various kinds, e.g. streams of news and social media texts, sequences of genes and sports events, etc. Comparison is an important and general task in data analysis. For comparing data streams involving multiple items (e.g., words in texts, actors or action types in action sequences, visited places in itineraries, etc.), we propose Co-Bridges, a visual design involving connection and comparison techniques that reveal similarities and differences between two streams. Co-Bridges use river and bridge metaphors, where two sides of a river represent data streams, and bridges connect temporally or sequentially aligned segments of streams. Commonalities and differences between these segments in terms of involvement of various items are shown on the bridges. Interactive query tools support the selection of particular stream subsets for focused exploration. The visualization supports both qualitative (common and distinct items) and quantitative (stream volume, amount of item involvement) comparisons. We further propose Comparison-of-Comparisons, in which two or more Co-Bridges corresponding to different selections are juxtaposed. We test the applicability of the Co-Bridges in different domains, including social media text streams and sports event sequences. We perform an evaluation of the users' capability to understand and use Co-Bridges. The results confirm that Co-Bridges is effective for supporting pair-wise visual comparisons in a wide range of applications.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000706330100138,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCo-Bridges%253A%2BPair-wise%2BVisual%2BConnection%2Band%2BComparison%2Bfor%2BMulti-item%2BData%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DSiming%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FTVCG.2020.3030411%26rft.eissn%3D1941-0506%26rft.epage%3D1622%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1077-2626%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BTRANSACTIONS%2BON%2BVISUALIZATION%2BAND%2BCOMPUTER%2BGRAPHICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1612-1622%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1612%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BT%2BVIS%2BCOMPUT%2BGR%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DAndrienko%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DYuan%252C%2BXR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=IEEE+TRANSACTIONS+ON+VISUALIZATION+AND+COMPUTER+GRAPHICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Lu, X",May 2020 ,Small Arctic rivers mapped from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and ArcticDEM,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Small rivers (< 30 m) are significant components of terrestrial river networks and remote sensing is a necessary tool to study them at the global scale. However, current global hydrography data products generally include only rivers that are wider than 30 m, neglecting smaller waterways and thus limiting our understanding of surface water processes, especially in remote areas. We present a new automated methodology to map two Arctic actively-flowing river networks (Kotuy and Coleen Rivers, with study areas of similar to 12,000 km(2) and 10,000 km2, respectively), including small rivers as narrow as 10 m from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery and high-resolution ArcticDEM digital elevation data. First, preliminary river network masks were generated by using Gabor filtering and path opening morphological operations on Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) images. Second, ArcticDEM data were employed to simulate surface flow paths, and the resultant drainage networks were used to create river areas of interest (AOI) and subsequently eliminate non-water features outside the river AOI. Third, gaps along remotely sensed small river channels were filled using the ArcticDEM-modeled drainage networks, yielding continuous river networks with high spatial resolution. We compared the 10 m Sentinel-ArcticDEM merged River Network (SARN) with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and four 30 m Landsat-derived hydrography data products (GSW, GRWL, FROM-GLC 2017, and G3WBM). We conclude: (1) SARNs have similar quality to the> 1st order NHD (> 70% of NHD streams appear in SARNs). (2) At a reach scale, SARNs include more small rivers with the drainage densities at least similar to 4.5 times larger than Landsat-derived hydrography data products. Similarly, coupling ArcticDEM data with 30 m Landsat satellite images increases resultant drainage densities approximately three-fold. (3) At a catchment scale, merging remotely sensed river networks with ArcticDEM-modeled drainage networks significantly improves river connectivity (defined as the longest connected river length) with at least a ten-fold increase over the other hydrography data products examined here. In sum, merging high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery with ArcticDEM data enable effective, continuous mapping of complex fluvial drainage patterns of Arctic rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000527390200082,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124689%26rft.atitle%3DSmall%2BArctic%2Brivers%2Bmapped%2Bfrom%2BSentinel-2%2Bsatellite%2Bimagery%2Band%2BArcticDEM%26rft.aufirst%3DXin%26rft.auinit%3DX%26rft.aulast%3DLu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.124689%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D584%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BMC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Henson, JM",Jun 2021 ,The Los Angeles River Reimagined: 51 Miles of Connected Public Open Space,LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE FRONTIERS,"The concrete channel of the Los Angeles (LA) River is probably one of the most recognizable rivers in the world. Channelized to manage the risk of flooding as the Los Angeles region urbanized, the river today is an architectural and engineering feat in the eyes of some people but an ecological disaster to others. The river flows adjacent to 17 cities and among some of the most environmentally burdened, park poor, and underserved communities of LA County. With over 2,300 acres of largely publicly owned land within the river right-of-way, a reimagined LA River can impact the lives of the one million people that live within a mile of the river.The LA River Master Plan, led by Los Angeles County and scheduled to be completed in fall 2021, proposes 51 miles of connected public open space with multi-benefit projects supporting nine goals ranging from flood resilience to housing affordability, to ecological function, and to arts, education, and culture. The data-based plan for the next 25 years includes a watershed-wide research effort to document and understand water quality, water conservation, and flood risk in relation to environmental and social issues. The plan includes traditional and innovative strategies within a ""kit of parts,"" interventions that include over 65 components ranging from habitat bridges to dry arroyo side channels demonstrating opportunities for enhancing ecosystem services to create a thriving urban habitat and connected network of parks along the river.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000703311600006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BLos%2BAngeles%2BRiver%2BReimagined%253A%2B51%2BMiles%2Bof%2BConnected%2BPublic%2BOpen%2BSpace%26rft.aufirst%3DJessica%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DHenson%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.15302%252FJ-LAF-1-040024%26rft.eissn%3D2095-5413%26rft.epage%3D72%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2096-336X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DLANDSCAPE%2BARCHITECTURE%2BFRONTIERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D58-72%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D58%26rft.stitle%3DLANDSC%2BARCHIT%2BFRONT%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DHenson%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DHanna%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84wuiTWepPD94u5flgHID&SrcJTitle=LANDSCAPE+ARCHITECTURE+FRONTIERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
