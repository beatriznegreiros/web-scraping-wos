1,1,"Dent, CL",Jun 2001 ,Multiscale effects of surface-subsurface exchange on stream water nutrient concentrations,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Stream-riparian ecosystems are landscapes composed of dynamic interacting terrestrial and aquatic patches. Patch composition and configuration affects both the form of transported materials and the amount of nutrient retention and export. We describe spatial patterns of nutrients in the surface water of an arid-land stream using surveys conducted at 3 different scales, ranging from 30 m to 10 km in extent and from 1 m to 25 m in grain. We then relate these patterns to connections with subsurface patches at channel subunit, channel unit, and reach scales. Our objectives were to compare spatial variation in nutrients across scales, to determine the causes of downstream changes in nutrient concentration in terms of intervening patches, and to investigate whether subsurface patches at different scales behaved similarly in terms of net nutrient processing.Nutrients varied spatially at all scales sampled. The highest variation was observed in nitrate-N (NO3,-N) in the survey with the smallest grain (CV = 161%) and the lowest was observed ed in soluble reactive P (SRP) in the same survey (CV = 17%). We hypothesized that downstream changes in nutrient concentrations were caused by upwelling of high-nutrient water from the subsurface To test this hypothesis, we identified locations of hydrologic inputs to surface water from the subsurface using geomorphic features of the stream such as gravel bar edges (channel subunit scale), riffle-run transitions (channel unit scale), and permanent groundwater sources (reach scale). As surface water passed over these locations, nutrient concentrations generally increased, particularly during late succession when subsurface patches acted as sources of NO3-N at all 3 scales and as sources of SRP at the channel unit and reach scales. A hierarchical approach allowed us to decompose effects of subsurface upwellings at different scales and to consider interactions between them. Processes occurring in subsurface patches influenced surface water nutrient patterns at scales from a few meters to several kilometers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000168756400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMultiscale%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bsurface-subsurface%2Bexchange%2Bon%2Bstream%2Bwater%2Bnutrient%2Bconcentrations%26rft.aufirst%3DCL%26rft.auinit%3DCL%26rft.aulast%3DDent%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468313%26rft.epage%3D181%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D162-181%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D162%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DDent%252C%2BCL%26rft.au%3DGrimm%252C%2BNB%26rft.au%3DFisher%252C%2BSG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1468313,"nutrient retention,hyporheic zone,scale,hierarchy,nitrogen,phosphorus,stream","SONORAN DESERT STREAM,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,4TH-ORDER MOUNTAIN STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,RIPARIAN ZONES,STORM DYNAMICS,RIVER",,"Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, 680 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA"
2,2,"Cornut, J",Mar 2014 ,Aquatic Hyphomycete Species Are Screened by the Hyporheic Zone of Woodland Streams,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Aquatic hyphomycetes strongly contribute to organic matter dynamics in streams, but their abilities to colonize leaf litter buried in streambed sediments remain unexplored. Here, we conducted field and laboratory experiments (slow-filtration columns and stream-simulating microcosms) to test the following hypotheses: (i) that the hyporheic habitat acting as a physical sieve for spores filters out unsuccessful strategists from a potential species pool, (ii) that decreased pore size in sediments reduces species dispersal efficiency in the interstitial water, and (iii) that the physicochemical conditions prevailing in the hyporheic habitat will influence fungal community structure. Our field study showed that spore abundance and species diversity were consistently reduced in the interstitial water compared with surface water within three differing streams. Significant differences occurred among aquatic hyphomycetes, with dispersal efficiency of filiform-spore species being much higher than those with compact or branched/tetraradiate spores. This pattern was remarkably consistent with those found in laboratory experiments that tested the influence of sediment pore size on spore dispersal in microcosms. Furthermore, leaves inoculated in a stream and incubated in slow-filtration columns exhibited a fungal assemblage dominated by only two species, while five species were codominant on leaves from the stream-simulating microcosms. Results of this study highlight that the hyporheic zone exerts two types of selection pressure on the aquatic hyphomycete community, a physiological stress and a physical screening of the benthic spore pool, both leading to drastic changes in the structure of fungal community.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000332025800017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAquatic%2BHyphomycete%2BSpecies%2BAre%2BScreened%2Bby%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bof%2BWoodland%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJulien%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DCornut%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1128%252FAEM.03024-13%26rft.eissn%3D1098-5336%26rft.epage%3D1960%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0099-2240%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BAND%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BMICROBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1949-1960%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1949%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BENVIRON%2BMICROB%26rft.volume%3D80%26rft.au%3DCornut%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DChauvet%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DElger%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+AND+ENVIRONMENTAL+MICROBIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1128/AEM.03024-13,,"LEAF-LITTER DECOMPOSITION,ORGANIC-MATTER,WATER EXCHANGE,FUNGI,SPORULATION,DIVERSITY,BREAKDOWN,DYNAMICS,DETRITUS,LEAVES",,"Univ Toulouse, Lab Interdisciplinaire Environm Continentaux, UMR 7360, Metz, France"
3,3,"Constantz, J",Mar 2016 ,Groundwater exchanges near a channelized versus unmodified stream mouth discharging to a subalpine lake,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The terminus of a stream flowing into a larger river, pond, lake, or reservoir is referred to as the stream-mouth reach or simply the stream mouth. The terminus is often characterized by rapidly changing thermal and hydraulic conditions that result in abrupt shifts in surface water/groundwater (sw/gw) exchange patterns, creating the potential for unique biogeochemical processes and ecosystems. Worldwide shoreline development is changing stream-lake interfaces through channelization of stream mouths, i.e., channel straightening and bank stabilization to prevent natural meandering at the shoreline. In the central Sierra Nevada (USA), Lake Tahoe's shoreline has an abundance of both unmodified (i.e., not engineered though potentially impacted by broader watershed engineering) and channelized stream mouths. Two representative stream mouths along the lake's north shore, one channelized and one unmodified, were selected to compare and contrast water and heat exchanges. Hydraulic and thermal properties were monitored during separate campaigns in September 2012 and 2013 and sw/gw exchanges were estimated within the stream mouth-shoreline continuum. Heat-flow and water-flow patterns indicated clear differences in the channelized versus the unmodified stream mouth. For the channelized stream mouth, relatively modulated, cool-temperature, low-velocity longitudinal streambed flows discharged offshore beneath warmer buoyant lakeshore water. In contrast, a seasonal barrier bar formed across the unmodified stream mouth, creating higher-velocity subsurface flow paths and higher diurnal temperature variations relative to shoreline water. As a consequence, channelization altered sw/gw exchanges potentially altering biogeochemical processing and ecological systems in and near the stream mouth.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000374706300033,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater%2Bexchanges%2Bnear%2Ba%2Bchannelized%2Bversus%2Bunmodified%2Bstream%2Bmouth%2Bdischarging%2Bto%2Ba%2Bsubalpine%2Blake%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DConstantz%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017013%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2177%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2157-2177%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2157%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DConstantz%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DNaranjo%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DStonestrom%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015WR017013,"stream mouth,shoreline,wave action,thermal tracing","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,WATER DISCHARGE,IN-STREAM,TEMPERATURE,VARIABILITY,SEEPAGE,SYSTEM,HEAT,INFILTRATION,PATTERNS",,"US Geol Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA"
4,4,"Zhang, PP",Jun 2020 ,"Water exchange in a large river-lake system: Modeling, characteristics and causes",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"River-lake water exchange reflects hydrological connectivity and the dynamic relationship between the river and the lake. The water exchange is crucial for lake level variation, downstream river discharge and the ecosystem. To figure out the water exchange between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake, a data-driven model was established based on the support vector regression and genetic algorithm technique. Nine scenarios were set with different river-lake hydrological conditions, divided into two categories: single-element change scenarios, where only the river conditions or only the lake conditions changed, and combined scenarios, where both elements changed simultaneously. The model could accurately simulate the river-lake water exchange variations. Scenario simulation results show that increasing the river flow or lowering the lake level could cause a decrease in the lake outflow. Conversely, decreasing river flow or raising the lake level could cause an increase in lake outflow. Changing lake conditions have a stronger impact on the water exchange variation than changing river conditions if the change percentages of the situation indicator values are the same. Similarly, lake level increase has a stronger impact on the water exchange variation than lake level decrease. The combined scenarios indicate the additive effect of the corresponding single-element change scenarios, with a clear linear relationship between their lake outflow changes. This study provides an efficient model for simulating complex hydrological flow relationships in river-lake systems, and supports the management of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake by providing the characteristics and causes of the river-lake water exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000511519100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWater%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Briver-lake%2Bsystem%253A%2BModeling%252C%2Bcharacteristics%2Band%2Bcauses%26rft.aufirst%3DPeipei%26rft.auinit%3DPP%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.3569%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D708%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D697-708%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D697%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BPP%26rft.au%3DMao%252C%2BJQ%26rft.au%3DDai%252C%2BHC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/rra.3569,"Poyang Lake,river-lake interaction,support vector regression,the Yangtze River,water exchange","AMAZON FLOODPLAIN LAKE,POYANG LAKE,YANGTZE-RIVER,NEURAL-NETWORKS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,CATCHMENT,CONNECTIVITY,IMPACTS,COMPLEX,BASIN",,"Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China"
5,5,"Torgeson, JM",Sep 21 2022 ,"Hydrobiogechemical interactions in the hyporheic zone of a sulfate-impacted, freshwater stream and riparian wetland ecosystem",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS,"Coupled abiotic and biotic processes in the hyporheic zone, where surface water and groundwater mix, play a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nutrients, and trace elements in streams and wetlands. Dynamic hydrologic conditions and anthropogenic pollution can impact redox gradients and biogeochemical response, although few studies examine the resulting hydrobiogeochemical interactions generated within the hyporheic zone. This study examines the effect of hyporheic flux dynamics and anthropogenic sulfate loading on the biogeochemistry of a riparian wetland and stream system. The hydrologic gradient as well as sediment, surface water, and porewater geochemistry chemistry was characterized at multiple points throughout the 2017 spring-summer-fall season at a sulfate-impacted stream flanked by wetlands in northern Minnesota. Results show that organic-rich sediments largely buffer the geochemical responses to brief or low magnitude changes in hydrologic gradient, but sustained or higher magnitude fluxes may variably alter the redox regime and, ultimately, the environmental geochemistry. This has implications for a changing climate that is expected to dramatically alter the hydrological cycle. Further, increased sulfate loading and dissolved or adsorbed ferric iron complexes in the hyporheic zone may induce a cryptic sulfur cycle linked to iron and carbon cycling, as indicated by the abundance of intermediate valence sulfur compounds (e.g., polysulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate) throughout the anoxic wetland and stream-channel sediment column. The observed deviation from a classical redox tower coupled with potential changes in hydraulic gradient in these organic-rich wetland and stream hyporheic zones has implications for nutrient, trace element, and greenhouse gas fluxes into surface water and groundwater, ultimately influencing water quality and global climate.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000806463900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrobiogechemical%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bsulfate-impacted%252C%2Bfreshwater%2Bstream%2Band%2Briparian%2Bwetland%2Becosystem%26rft.aufirst%3DJoshua%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DTorgeson%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1039%252Fd2em00024e%26rft.eissn%3D2050-7895%26rft.epage%3D1382%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2050-7887%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE-PROCESSES%2B%2526%2BIMPACTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1360-1382%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1360%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI-PROC%2BIMP%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DTorgeson%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DRosenfeld%252C%2BCE%26rft.au%3DSantelli%252C%2BCM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE-PROCESSES+%26+IMPACTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1039/d2em00024e,,"ACID-VOLATILE SULFIDE,ANAEROBIC METHANE OXIDATION,ZERO-VALENT SULFUR,HOT MOMENTS,CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS,THERMODYNAMIC LADDER,ELECTRON-TRANSFER,HYDROGEN-SULFIDE,HUMIC SUBSTANCES,ELEMENTAL SULFUR",,"Univ Minnesota, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA"

The weathering of unconsolidated aquifer materials, derived from mine waste piles, consists of As-bearing minerals including arsenopyrite, scorodite, and iron oxides, providing a continuous source of As to water. Arsenic loads from the stream, springs, and groundwater were quantified at the study reach on nine dates from January to August 2005, and a mass balance approach was used to determine hyporheic storage of As. Loading from groundwater was the dominant source of As to the stream, while loads from springs represented a substantial proportion of the As load during spring. Arsenic loads in surface and groundwater were significantly elevated during summer despite lower discharge; groundwater load was positively correlated to aquifer temperature. The hyporheic zone retained As in the upstream-most subreach, most likely through the adsorption of As onto hyporheic sediments. In downstream subreaches, hyporheic sediments, derived from mine-tailing piles of high As content, were sources of As to the stream. Spatial variation in sediment source and composition reflecting flood transport from upstream and mass wasting of mine tailings, along with temporal changes in hydrology, combine to dictate the role of the hyporheic zone in the transport and retention of As.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000250712500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW11404%26rft.atitle%3DArsenic%2Btransport%2Bin%2Bgroundwater%252C%2Bsurface%2Bwater%252C%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bmine-influenced%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bsystem%26rft.aufirst%3DBrendan%2BV.%26rft.auinit%3DBV%26rft.aulast%3DBrown%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2006WR005687%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DBrown%252C%2BBV%26rft.au%3DValett%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DSchreiber%252C%2BME&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2006WR005687,,"APPALACHIAN HEADWATER STREAM,UPLAND STREAM,MASS-BALANCE,RHODAMINE-WT,SPECIATION,EXCHANGE,ADSORPTION,RETENTION,SEDIMENTS,MOBILIZATION",,"Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
7,7,"Naranjo, RC",Sep 2015 ,Mixing effects on nitrogen and oxygen concentrations and the relationship to mean residence time in a hyporheic zone of a riffle-pool sequence,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Flow paths and residence times in the hyporheic zone are known to influence biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification. The exchange across the sediment-water interface may involve mixing of surface water and groundwater through complex hyporheic flow paths that contribute to highly variable biogeochemically active zones. Despite the recognition of these patterns in the literature, conceptualization and analysis of flow paths and nitrogen transformations beneath riffle-pool sequences often neglect to consider bed form driven exchange along the entire reach. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) were monitored in the hyporheic zone beneath a riffle-pool sequence on a losing section of the Truckee River, NV. Spatially varying hyporheic exchange and the occurrence of multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells are shown to influence concentrations of DO and NO3- and the mean residence time (MRT) of riffle and pool areas. Distinct patterns observed in piezometers are shown to be influenced by the first large flow event following a steady 8 month period of low flow conditions. Increases in surface water discharge resulted in reversed hydraulic gradients and production of nitrate through nitrification at small vertical spatial scales (0.10-0.25 m) beneath the sediment-water interface. In areas with high downward flow rates and low MRT, denitrification may be limited. The use of a longitudinal two-dimensional flow model helped identify important mechanisms such as multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells and spatially varying MRT, an important driver for nitrogen transformation in the riverbed. Our observations of DO and NO3- concentrations and model simulations highlight the role of multi-scale hyporheic mixing cells on MRT and nitrogen transformations in the hyporheic zone of riffle-pool sequences.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000363391300017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMixing%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bnitrogen%2Band%2Boxygen%2Bconcentrations%2Band%2Bthe%2Brelationship%2Bto%2Bmean%2Bresidence%2Btime%2Bin%2Ba%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Briffle-pool%2Bsequence%26rft.aufirst%3DRamon%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DRC%26rft.aulast%3DNaranjo%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR016593%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7217%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7202-7217%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7202%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DNaranjo%252C%2BRC%26rft.au%3DNiswonger%252C%2BRG%26rft.au%3DDavis%252C%2BCJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014WR016593,"hyporheic zone,nitrogen reactions,mixing,mean residence time","DESERT STREAM ECOSYSTEM,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,SURFACE-WATER,MOUNTAIN STREAM,RIPARIAN ZONES,HOT MOMENTS,BED FORMS,GROUNDWATER,NITRATE",,"US Geol Survey, Carson City, NV 89701 USA"
8,8,"Hitt, NP",Jul 2008 ,River-stream connectivity affects fish bioassessment performance,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Stream fish bioassessment methods assume that fish assemblages observed in sample sites reflect responses to local stressors, but fish assemblages are influenced by local factors as well as regional dispersal to and from connected streams. We hypothesized that fish movement to and from refugia and source populations in connected rivers (i.e., riverine dispersal) would weaken or decouple relations between fish community metrics and local environmental conditions. We compared fish-environment relations between streams that flow into large rivers (mainstem tributaries) and streams that lack riverine confluences (headwater tributaries) at multiple spatial grains using data from the USEPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in the mid-Atlantic highlands, USA (n = 157 sites). Headwater and mainstem tributaries were not different in local environmental conditions, but showed important differences in fish metric responses to environmental quality gradients. Stream sites flowing into mainstem channels within 10 fluvial km showed consistently weaker relations to local environmental conditions than stream sites that lacked such mainstem connections. Moreover, these patterns diminished at longer distances from riverine confluences, consistent with the hypothesis of riverine dispersal. Our results suggest that (1) the precision of fish bioassessment metrics may be improved by calibrating scoring criteria based on the spatial position of sites within stream networks and (2) the spatial grain of fish bioassessment studies may be manipulated to suit objectives by including or excluding fishes exhibiting riverine dispersal.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000256080300011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiver-stream%2Bconnectivity%2Baffects%2Bfish%2Bbioassessment%2Bperformance%26rft.aufirst%3DNathaniel%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DNP%26rft.aulast%3DHitt%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00267-008-9115-5%26rft.eissn%3D1432-1009%26rft.epage%3D150%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0364-152X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D132-150%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D132%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMANAGE%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DHitt%252C%2BNP%26rft.au%3DAngermeier%252C%2BPL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00267-008-9115-5,"stream network topology,connectivity,fish,bioassessment,dispersal,mantel test,nonmetric multidimensional scaling,mid-atlantic highlands","MID-ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS,ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE,BIOTIC INTEGRITY,LAND-USE,WATER-QUALITY,SCALE CHARACTERISTICS,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,SPATIAL POSITION,EXTINCTION RISK,HABITAT",,"Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
9,9,"Chen, C",May 2015 ,Using the level set method to study the effects of heterogeneity and anisotropy on hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The level set method was used to simulate the interface movement when a conservative solute migrated from stream water to subsurface water, and study the effects of streambed heterogeneity and anisotropy on solute penetration. The level set method is a numerical technique for tracking moving interfaces based on the idea that the interface is a level set curve of a higher-dimensional function. Numerical simulations were compared to experiments conducted in a recirculating flume. Streambed heterogeneity led to water exchange between multiple bed forms, while in homogeneous streambeds the water exchange was restricted within a single bed form. A thin layer of homogeneous sediments at the top of the heterogeneous streambeds significantly increased the interfacial water influx, resulting in faster solute penetration and stream concentration decrease. Streambed heterogeneity generated horizontal preferential flow paths in the upper part of the bed while decreasing pore water velocities deeper in the bed, which hindered vertical penetration and consequently led to slower stream concentration decrease. Decreasing vertical permeability or increasing horizontal permeability led to slower vertical penetration and stream concentration decrease. Decreasing vertical permeability had a much more significant impact on solute penetration than increasing horizontal permeability, because mass transfer in hyporheic exchange is greatly dominated by vertical advection which depends primarily on the vertical permeability. This study was the first to apply the level set method in the study of hyporheic exchange. The theoretical and numerical methods have important applications in subsurface flow and transport processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000357833600034,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2Bthe%2Blevel%2Bset%2Bmethod%2Bto%2Bstudy%2Bthe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bheterogeneity%2Band%2Banisotropy%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DCheng%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR016444%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D3634%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3617-3634%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3617%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DZeng%252C%2BLZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2014WR016444,,"STREAM-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,INTERFACES,SOLUTES",,"Virginia Tech, Dept Min & Minerals Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
10,10,"Marmonier, P",Oct 10 2020 ,Are surface water characteristics efficient to locate hyporheic biodiversity hotspots?,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Location of river-groundwater exchange zones and biodiversity hotspot is essential fora river management plan, especially for Mediterranean karstic rivers. This location is often difficult and time-consuming when long river sectors are considered. We studied a 13 km-long sector of the Ceze River (Southern France) located in a karstic canyon. We compared five indicators of river-groundwater exchanges: longitudinal profiles of temperature, electrical conductivity and Rn-222 concentrations in the surface water of the river, chemical characteristics of the hyporheic water and hyporheic biodiversity. Upwelling zones occurred downstream of geomorphological heterogeneities (here at the tail of gravel bars). Surface water chemistry, especially electrical conductivity and Rn-222 concentrations, clearly traces large scale gaining sections, which were not associated to valley narrowing but with lateral springs, suggesting a crucial role of the geological structuration of the karstic plateau of Mejanne-le-Clap. Hyporheic water chemistry fits with the large-scale hydrological pattern, but with a high variability corresponding to local heterogeneities. The stygobite fauna (obligate groundwater organisms) and benthic EPTC (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera) occurred preferentially in the gaining sections fed by groundwater, likely because of oligotrophic water and cooler temperature. The spatial distribution of river-groundwater exchange zone and hyporheic biodiversity may be thus predicted using changes in surface water chemistry, especially for electrical conductivity and Rn-222 concentrations.

Hydrologic flow between a downwelling and an upwelling zone beneath a riffle-pool sequence promoted hyporheic-ground-water interaction and differentiated regions of increased bacterial activity, production, turnover time, and responsiveness to dissolved organic carbon enrichment. Large gaps in knowledge exist on the structure and function of fungal, bacterial, microalgal, protozoan, and micrometazoan assemblages within hyporheic zones. This study, combined with available literature on surface and groundwater microbial assemblages, generated several hypotheses for future research. Hydrological methods, when coupled with biochemical measurements, micro-techniques, and descriptions of hyporheic physicochemical and biological gradients, can potentially contribute to a greater understanding of the role of hyporheic microbial communities in the structure and function of lotic ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1993KR24300009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMICROBIAL%2BECOLOGY%2BOF%2BTHE%2BHYPORHEIC%2BZONE%2B-%2BA%2BPERSPECTIVE%2BINTEGRATING%2BHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BBIOLOGY%26rft.aufirst%3DSP%26rft.auinit%3DSP%26rft.aulast%3DHENDRICKS%26rft.date%3D1993%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1467687%26rft.epage%3D78%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D70-78%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D70%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D12&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1467687,"HYDROLOGY,GROUNDWATER,HYPORHEIC ZONE,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,BACTERIA,LOTIC ECOSYSTEMS",,,"OAK RIDGE NATL LAB,DIV ENVIRONM SCI,OAK RIDGE,TN 37831, USA"
12,12,"Packman, AI",Oct 2001 ,Hyporheic exchange of solutes and colloids with moving bed forms,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream-subsurface exchange provides the opportunity for stream-borne substances to interact with streambed sediments in the subsurface hyporheic mixing zone. The downstream transport of both solutes and colloids can be substantially affected by this exchange, with significant implications for contaminant transport and stream ecology. Several previous studies have demonstrated that bed form-induced advective flows (pumping) and scour/deposition of bed sediments (turnover) will often be the dominant processes controlling local exchange with the streambed. A new model is presented for combined turnover and pumping exchange due to relatively fast-moving bed forms, i.e., when turnover dominates the exchange in the upper part of the bed where active bed sediment transport occurs. While turnover rapidly mixes the upper layer of the bed, advective pumping produces exchange with the deeper, unscoured region of the subsurface. The net exchange due to these processes was analyzed using fundamental hydraulic principles: the initial exchange was calculated using an existing geometric model for turnover, and then the later exchange was determined by analyzing the advective flow induced under the moving bed form field. The exchange of colloidal particles due to moving bed forms was also modeled by considering the further effects of particle settling and filtration in the subsurface. Experiments were conducted in a recirculating flume to evaluate solute (conservative Li+) and colloid (kaolinite) exchange with a sand bed. The solute and colloid exchange models performed well for fast-moving bed forms, but underpredicted the colloid exchanges observed with lower rates of bed sediment transport. For very slowly moving bed forms it was found that turnover could be completely neglected, and observed colloid exchanges were represented well by a pure pumping model. In the intermediate case where turnover and pumping rates are similar, water carried into the bed by turnover is immediately released by pumping, and vice versa. Thus, while this work further elucidated the basic processes controlling solute and colloid exchange with a bed covered by bed forms and provided a fundamental model for exchange due to fast-moving bed forms, exchange in the intermediate case where turnover and pumping tend to compete can only be bounded by current models.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000171211300014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bof%2Bsolutes%2Band%2Bcolloids%2Bwith%2Bmoving%2Bbed%2Bforms%26rft.aufirst%3DAI%26rft.auinit%3DAI%26rft.aulast%3DPackman%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2001WR000477%26rft.epage%3D2605%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2591-2605%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2591%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D37%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DBrooks%252C%2BNH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2001WR000477,,"ACID-MINE DRAINAGE,DEAD-ZONE MODEL,TRANSIENT STORAGE,WATER EXCHANGE,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS,PERMEABLE SEDIMENTS,ADVECTIVE TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,HEADWATER STREAMS",,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"

Hydrodynamic variations driven by the long-term managed aquifer recharge (MAR) practice could change hyporheic geochemical processes, which requires a better understanding for groundwater management. In this work, a geochemical survey was conducted in a multi-aquifer MAR system. The results showed great impact of the MAR practice on the hydrodynamics and major ion chemistry of groundwater in the hyporheic zone compared to natural recharge. Besides, related geochemical processes including rock weathering and ion exchange showed increased effect on hyporheic hydrochemistry with aquifer depth, depending on hydrogeological conditions in addition to river water infiltration. Combined with hydrochemical indicators and the end-member mixing model, the relative contribution of precipitation to groundwater was estimated to be 5% for the 30-m aquifer, 16% for the 50-m aquifer, and 64% for the 80-m aquifer. However, precipitation made small contributions (<5%) to the major ions of groundwater regardless of depth. Conversely, the relative contributions of river water infiltration decreased with aquifer depth (95%-> 84%-> 36%), and its proportional contributions to major ions showed a similar trend (90%-> 84%-> 39%), which suggests reduced SW-GW interaction intensity with depth in the hyporheic zone. The major ion compositions of hyporheic groundwater tend towards river water after the long-term MAR practice, reflecting comprehensive effect of mixing and related geochemical processes. This study demonstrates the relevance of detailed studies at regional scale to understand anthropogenic effects from projects such as MAR on groundwater geochemistry especially in multi-aquifer systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000681700400004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B105032%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bzone%2Bgeochemistry%2Bof%2Ba%2Bmulti-aquifer%2Bsystem%2Bused%2Bfor%2Bmanaged%2Baquifer%2Brecharge%2Bin%2BBeijing%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DSiling%26rft.auinit%3DSL%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.apgeochem.2021.105032%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9134%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0883-2927%26rft.jtitle%3DAPPLIED%2BGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAPPL%2BGEOCHEM%26rft.volume%3D131%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BSL%26rft.au%3DBian%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BHJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=APPLIED+GEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.105032,"Hydrochemistry,Major ions,Groundwater,MAR,SW-GW interaction,Hyporheic zone","RECLAIMED WATER,STABLE-ISOTOPE,RIVER WATER,SHALLOW GROUNDWATER,SURFACE-WATER,CHAOBAI RIVER,YELLOW-RIVER,CHEMISTRY,FLOW,TRANSFORMATION",,"Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Water & Ecol, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China"
14,14,"Zhang, YP",Apr 15 2006 ,An experimental investigation of streaming potentials through homogeneous ion-exchange membranes,DESALINATION,"Streaming potentials through homogeneous ion-exchange membranes (IEMs) were studied with several anion-exchange membranes prepared in our laboratory. Discussions are mainly concentrated on the effects of the chemistry, concentration and pH of the outer solution as well as the thickness and ion-exchange capacity of the IEMs. Results show that except for the membrane thickness hardly affecting the streaming potential coefficient, the remaining factors influence it more or less. The difference of the streaming potential coefficient for different electrolyte solutions with equal concentrations is due to different mobilities of the cations or anions of those electrolytes; the pH of outer solution only alters the magnitude of the streaming potential coefficient, but has no influence on its sign; and the streaming potential coefficient increases with increasing IEC and with decreasing concentration of the outer solution. The desalination rate of the IEMs can be also roughly estimated by the difference of the electrical potential in two opposite pressure directions including the pressure-increase direction (+) and the pressure-reduced direction (-).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000237169800024,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2Bexperimental%2Binvestigation%2Bof%2Bstreaming%2Bpotentials%2Bthrough%2Bhomogeneous%2Bion-exchange%2Bmembranes%26rft.aufirst%3DYP%26rft.auinit%3DYP%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.desal.2005.09.006%26rft.eissn%3D1873-4464%26rft.epage%3D266%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0011-9164%26rft.issue%3D1-3%26rft.jtitle%3DDESALINATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D256-266%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D256%26rft.stitle%3DDESALINATION%26rft.volume%3D190%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BYP%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BTW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=DESALINATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.desal.2005.09.006,"streaming potential,anion-exchange membrane,ion-exchange membranes,desalination","CAPILLARY SYSTEMS,NARROW PORES,BIPOLAR MEMBRANES,ELECTROCHEMISTRY,CONDUCTIVITY,ELECTROOSMOSIS,TRANSPORT",,"Univ Sci & Technol China, Lab Funct Membrane, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China"
15,15,"Ingendahl, D",Aug 2002 ,Linking hyporheic community respiration and inorganic nitrogen transformations in the River Lahn (Germany),ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"Hyporheic community respiration was measured in a riffle-pool-riffle sequence located up- and downstream from a wastewater treatment plant of the River Lahn, Germany. Sediment filled tubes were incubated for several months in the hyporheic zone and then transferred to the laboratory where the oxygen consumption by the hyporheic community colonizing the tubes was measured in a recirculating system. Oxygen consumption in 64 tubes from four sites averaged 0.69 mg O-2 dm(-3) h(-1) with surface water from upstream of the wastewater treatment plant. After the successive amendment of nitrite and ammonium, community respiration increased to 1.14 and 1.36 mg O-2 dm(-3) h(-1), respectively. Nitrate production during the experiments increased from 0.024 mg NO3-N dm(-3) h(-1) to 0.219 and 0.220 mg NO3-N dm(-3) h(-1) with the amendment of nitrite and ammonium, respectively, indicating nitrogen limitation in the hyporheic zone. Respiration and nitrate production correlated strongly with the amount of organic matter accumulated in the tubes during the several months of sediment incubation. Significantly higher respiration and nitrate production after amendment of ammonium were observed for the two sites located downstream of the wastewater treatment plant effluent in comparison to those upstream of the WWTP. This increase indicates a possible impact of wastewater supply to rivers, especially on the hyporheic zone where an important part of organic matter break-down and nutrient recycling occurs in mesotrophic rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000177786900006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLinking%2Bhyporheic%2Bcommunity%2Brespiration%2Band%2Binorganic%2Bnitrogen%2Btransformations%2Bin%2Bthe%2BRiver%2BLahn%2B%2528Germany%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DD%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DIngendahl%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft.epage%3D120%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D99-120%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D99%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D155%26rft.au%3DIngendahl%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3Dter%2BHaseborg%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DWerner%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"nitrification,oxygen consumption,biofilms,sediment respiration","NITRITE ACCUMULATION,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,EXCHANGE PROCESSES,MOUNTAIN STREAM,SEDIMENTS,WATER,ZONE,BED,BACTERIA,DYNAMICS",,"Univ Kassel, Inst Gewasserforsch & Gewasserschutz, Kurt Wolters Str 3, D-34125 Kassel, Germany"
16,16,"Moren, I",Nov 2017 ,Design of Remediation Actions for Nutrient Mitigation in the Hyporheic Zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Although hyporheic exchange has been shown to be of great importance for the overall water quality of streams, it is rarely considered quantitatively in stream remediation projects. A main driver of hyporheic exchange is the hydraulic head fluctuation along the streambed, which can be enhanced by modifications of the streambed topography. Here we present an analytical 2-D spectral subsurface flow model to estimate the hyporheic exchange associated with streambed topographies over a wide range of spatial scales; a model that was validated using tracer-test-results and measurements of hydraulic conductivity. Specifically, engineered steps in the stream were shown to induce a larger hyporheic exchange velocity and shorter hyporheic residence times compared to the observed topography in Tullstorps Brook, Sweden. Hyporheic properties were used to parameterize a longitudinal transport model that accounted for reactions in terms of first-order decay and instantaneous adsorption. Theoretical analyses of the mitigation effect for nitrate due to denitrification in the hyporheic zone show that there is a Damkohler number of the hyporheic zone, associated with several different stream geomorphologies, that optimizes nitrate mass removal on stream reach scale. This optimum can be limited by the available hydraulic head gradient given by the slope of the stream and the geological constraints of the streambed. The model illustrates the complex interactions between design strategies for nutrient mitigation, hyporheic flow patterns, and stream biogeochemistry and highlights the importance to diagnose a stream prior remediation, specifically to evaluate if remediation targets are transport or reaction controlled.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000418736700013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDesign%2Bof%2BRemediation%2BActions%2Bfor%2BNutrient%2BMitigation%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DI.%26rft.auinit%3DI%26rft.aulast%3DMoren%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR020127%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D8899%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D8872-8899%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D8872%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DMoren%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DWorman%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DRiml%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2016WR020127,,"RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,IN-STREAM STRUCTURES,NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSIENT STORAGE,INSET FLOODPLAINS,NITRATE REMOVAL,EXCHANGE,DENITRIFICATION,RESTORATION,WATER",,"Royal Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Architectural Engn, Div Hydraul Engn, Stockholm, Sweden"
17,17,"Navel, S",2012 ,A modelling approach to quantify the influence of fine sediment deposition on biogeochemical processes occurring in the hyporheic zone,ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"Excessive sedimentation of fine particles on stream beds has been recognized as a major threat to running-water ecosystems. Deposition of fine sediments often affects hyporheic zone (HZ) functioning by (1) reducing hydrological exchanges at the water-sediment interface and by (2) increasing the organic matter (OM) content of surface sediments. These two factors usually occur concurrently to control biogeochemical processes in sediments. In the present study, experimental and modelling approaches were coupled to evaluate the contribution of these factors on the biogeochemical functioning of the HZ. We used a one-dimensional (1D) vertical model taking into account the hydrodynamic properties, the vertical distribution of the OM and the main microbial processes involved in OM processing (aerobic respiration, denitrification, nitrification and sulphate reduction). This Mobile-Immobile Model for Organic Matter (MIM-OM) model was calibrated and validated using experimental data (conservative tracer, dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations) obtained in filtration columns filled with a porous sedimentary matrix. Simulations showed that organic carbon content and Darcy velocity acted in concert to shape biogeochemical processes in stream sediments. The use of the MIM-OM model on data obtained in filtration columns impacted by fine sediment deposition indicated that the biodegradability of the OM (modified through the degradation parameter k(POC)) also played a key role on biogeochemical processes occurring in sediments. In conclusion, the MIM-OM model appears as an efficient simulation tool to evaluate biogeochemical functioning in river sediments under different conditions (granulometry, quality of surface water and clogging).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000310754500003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmodelling%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Bquantify%2Bthe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bfine%2Bsediment%2Bdeposition%2Bon%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bprocesses%2Boccurring%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DNavel%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Flimn%252F2012017%26rft.epage%3D287%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-4088%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DANNALES%2BDE%2BLIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D279-287%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D279%26rft.stitle%3DANN%2BLIMNOL-INT%2BJ%2BLIM%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DNavel%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DSauvage%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DMermillod-Blondin%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ANNALES+DE+LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1051/limn/2012017,"Mathematical modeling,hyporheic zone,organic carbon,clogging,biogeochemistry","ORGANIC-MATTER MINERALIZATION,PERFUSION CORES,RIVER SEDIMENTS,SHINGOBEE RIVER,NITROGEN,CARBON,WATER,STREAM,OXYGEN,BED",,"Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, ENTPE, UMR Ecol Hydrosyst Nat & Anthropises 5023, 6 Rue Raphael Dubois, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"
18,18,"Laube, G",Dec 2018 ,The systematic effect of streambed conductivity heterogeneity on hyporheic flux and residence time,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"A systematic understanding of hyporheic flux (HF) and residence times (RT) is important as they are a major control of biogeochemical processing in streambeds. Previous studies addressing the effect of heterogeneity in streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) on HF and RT have come to deviating conclusions depending on the specific study design and the selection of heterogeneity cases being investigated. To more systematically evaluate the effects of conductivity heterogeneity on HF and RT, we simulated hyporheic exchange induced by idealized streambed ripples over a large range of heterogeneities. Conductivity heterogeneity was represented in the simulations in terms of 10,000 different heterogeneity realizations from a geostatistical model based on continuous Gaussian and discrete indicator random fields. We demonstrate that any isotropic homogeneous K-field, as an average of a heterogeneous K-field, can only match RT or HF of the respective heterogeneous K-field, but never both. We found exponential correlations of RT and HF with the variance of heterogeneous conductivity. Based on these correlations, an equivalent anisotropic homogeneous conductivity tensor K can be derived. This equivalent anisotropic K efficiently accounts for the effects of small scale heterogeneity on HF and RT. It can be calculated from the median and variance of the hydraulic conductivity distribution of the targeted heterogeneous sediment, without explicitly characterizing the sediment texture.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000450094200005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bsystematic%2Beffect%2Bof%2Bstreambed%2Bconductivity%2Bheterogeneity%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bflux%2Band%2Bresidence%2Btime%26rft.aufirst%3DGerrit%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DLaube%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2018.10.003%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.epage%3D69%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D60-69%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D60%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D122%26rft.au%3DLaube%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DSchmidt%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DFleckenstein%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.10.003,"Conductivity heterogeneity,Hyporheic exchange,Residence time","HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,BED FORMS,POROUS-MEDIA,EXCHANGE,FLOW,TRANSPORT,AQUIFER,FIELDS,ANISOTROPY,MODELS",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Hydrogeol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany"
19,19,"Baratelli, F",Nov 2016 ,"Estimation of stream-aquifer exchanges at regional scale using a distributed model: Sensitivity to in-stream water level fluctuations, riverbed elevation and roughness",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Several studies on stream-aquifer interactions focus on the local scale. However, the estimation of stream-aquifer exchanges for a regional river network remains challenging. This study aims at assessing the sensitivity of distributed stream-aquifer exchanges to in-stream water level fluctuations, riverbed elevation and Manning roughness coefficient.An integrated distributed surface-subsurface model is applied to the Loire river basin (117,480 km(2), France), where in-stream water level fluctuations are taken into account with a simplified Manning-Strickler approach. The stream-aquifer exchanges are analyzed at pluri-annual and annual scales, as well as during short-term hydrological events.The model simulates the spatio-temporal variability of in-stream water levels accurately, with Nash coefficients up to 0.96 for the Loire river. The river network mainly drains the aquifer system. The average net exchanged flow is 2.10(-2) m(3) s(-1) km(-1), which corresponds to 12% of the averaged discharge at the outlet of the basin.The assumption of constant river stages significantly impacts the total infiltration (-70%) and exfiltration (-10%) in the basin, whereas it has a negligible influence on the average net flux. The river fluctuations increase the time variability of the stream-aquifer exchanges and may determine flow reversals during flood events and also more frequently for river stretches at equilibrium with its nearby aquifer.This study highlights the importance of accounting for river stage fluctuations in the modeling of regional hydrosystems. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis indicates that it is mandatory to develop new methodologies to better estimate the riverbed elevation at high resolution for a river network at regional scale. In a lesser extent, errors on Manning coefficient affect the timing of infiltration and exfiltration, leading to temporally localized discrepancies. However it does not affect the estimates of the global net exchanges significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The macroinvertebrate communities in two river-disconnected lakes (Poyang Lake and Shijiu Lake) and the rivers connected to Shijiu Lake were investigated to reveal the differences in communities and explore the relationships with biotic factors. A total of 34 species were recorded in the three water bodies. Combined with the previous study results, the dominant species in Poyang Lake is almost unchanged since 1997. Mollusks were dominated in abundance in Poyang Lake and the rivers connected to Shijiu Lake, while oligochaetes dominated the communities in Shijiu Lake. The alpha diversity indices of macroinvertebrates in Poyang Lake and the rivers connected to Shijiu Lake were distinctly higher than that of Shijiu Lake, and the beta diversity index of Shijiu Lake was the highest, supporting the rules that alpha diversity of macroinvertebrates achieves a maximum at a moderate level of connectivity and beta diversity seems to be higher when the connectivity is weaker. The differences in communities were significant between the Poyang Lake and Shijiu Lake, while the differences in the Poyang Lake and the rivers connected to Shijiu Lake were not significant. According to the results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), protozoon densities and phytoplankton biomass affected the distribution of macroinvertebrates in Shijiu Lake. Species number of planktonic crustaceans influenced the distribution of macroinvertebrates in rivers connected to Shijiu Lake, while species number of rotifer and densities of phytoplankton distinctly impacted on the distribution of macroinvertebrates in Poyang Lake.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000384330800035,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B577%26rft.atitle%3DMacroinvertebrate%2Bcommunities%2Band%2Bthe%2Brelationships%2Bwith%2Bbiotic%2Bfactors%2Bin%2Briver-connected%2Blakes%2Bin%2Bthe%2Blower%2Breaches%2Bof%2BYangtze%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DShiyun%26rft.auinit%3DSY%26rft.aulast%3DChi%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10661-016-5602-y%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2959%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0167-6369%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMONITORING%2BAND%2BASSESSMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMONIT%2BASSESS%26rft.volume%3D188%26rft.au%3DChi%252C%2BSY%26rft.au%3DZheng%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DHu%252C%2BJX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MONITORING+AND+ASSESSMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10661-016-5602-y,"Macroinvertebrates,River-connected lakes,Biotic factors,Communities,Yangtze river","FRESH-WATER LAKE,HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY,ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES,SPECIES-DIVERSITY,LITTORAL-ZONE,POYANG LAKE,DOWNSTREAM,PATTERNS,MACROZOOBENTHOS,RESTORATION",,"Minist Water Resources, Inst Hydroecol, Key Lab Ecol Impacts Hydraul Projects & Restorat, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China"
21,21,"Grodzka-Lukaszewska, M",2021 ,Spatial distribution of the water exchange through river cross-section - measurements and the numerical model,ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,"The aspects of surface stability and groundwater exchange recognized by many researchers due to the intensification of agriculture and industry (manifested in, e.g., regulation and dredging of riverbed sediments of rivers) are now widely discussed on the international forum of water policy and management. It is essential to assess the spatial variability of water exchange through the river length and cross sections for the preparation of data and calculation of the groundwater flow model. This article presents research which describes the spatial distribution of the surface water-groundwater interaction within the river cross-section. Two measurement series were carried out to describe its variability. Additionally, a groundwater flow model was developed to simulate and represent the variable nature of water exchange in the hyporheic zone in the river's cross-section. The model was successfully verified by means of measurements of water flux in the hyporheic zone. The precise spatial description of this variability is the first step to determine the possibility of introducing this variable in an accurate manner, within the limits of measurement uncertainties or simulation assumptions, in the construction of mathematical models of groundwater flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000627901100009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bthrough%2Briver%2Bcross-section%2B-%2Bmeasurements%2Band%2Bthe%2Bnumerical%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DMaria%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DGrodzka-Lukaszewska%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.24425%252Faep.2021.136450%26rft.eissn%3D2083-4810%26rft.epage%3D79%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2083-4772%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIVES%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BPROTECTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D69-79%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D69%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BENVIRON%2BPROT%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DGrodzka-Lukaszewska%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DPawlak%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DSinicyn%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ARCHIVES+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+PROTECTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.24425/aep.2021.136450,"numerical modeling,hyporheic zone,hydraulic properties,Gradient/flux measurement,Groundwater/surface-water relations",,,"Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Bldg Serv Hydro & Environm Engn, Warsaw, Poland"
22,22,"Korkmaz, S",Mar 15 2009 ,Application of the coupled model to the Somme river basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrological modeling of the Somme river basin situated in the north of France was made with special emphasis on the stream-aquifer interaction. Due to immense groundwater storage in the chalk aquifer, a damaging flood took place in the basin in spring 2001. To best represent the phenomena occurring in the basin, the coupled model also known as MODCOU was selected to be applied to this particular basin. The whole model structure consists of several components, namely, surface model, groundwater model, unsaturated zone model, and the coupled model. In order to run the surface model, meteorological forcing, land use, and soil type data were acquired. By using land use and soil type data, production zones were obtained. The surface model partitions the precipitation between surface runoff, infiltration, and actual evapotranspiration according to the parameters of production zones. The unsaturated zone model computes the recharge of groundwater by using infiltration from the surface using a Nash cascade model. By using the groundwater model, a steady-state piezometric head distribution is obtained to serve as an initial condition to the coupled model. The unsteady groundwater and surface flow simulations are carried out by the coupled model. Initially, spatial information on the basin was extracted by using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) analysis. After acquiring the necessary spatial data, the surface and aquifer grids were generated by using nested grid generators which make refinement on the stream network and sub-catchment boundaries in order to increase the accuracy of numerical solution. A very detailed calibration was performed by following a step-by-step procedure in which the best fit in flow and piezometric head hydrographs was sought. In the surface model, concentration time and parameters of production zones are calibrated. For coupled surface-groundwater flows transmissivity, specific yield and discharge coefficient; and for flow in unsaturated zone storage constant were calibrated. During the simulations, intense and interrupted exfiltrations were observed over the basin. Two algorithms were developed in order to correct the issue caused by the coarse resolution of the DEM: (1) a 'fill' algorithm was used to remove the sinks and obtain a smoother surface; and (2) a correction procedure for river cell elevations is proposed to acquire continuous exfiltration along the stream network. Validation of the model was made using the discharges at two points on the Somme, namely, Hangest-Sur-Somme and Peronne, which had not been used in any stage of the modeling process and satisfactory results were obtained. The groundwater behavior, its effect on the surface flow and the flood of 2001 are satisfactorily represented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

23,23,"Wu, LW",Dec 2018 ,Impact of Dynamically Changing Discharge on Hyporheic Exchange Processes Under Gaining and Losing Groundwater Conditions,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Channel discharge, geomorphological setting, and regional groundwater flow determine the spatiotemporal variability of bedform-induced hyporheic exchange and the emergence of biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments that it drives. Of particular interest, and significantly understudied, is the role that dynamically changing discharge has on the hyporheic exchange process and how regional groundwater flow modulates the effects of transience. In this study, we use a reduced-complexity model to systematically explore the bedform-induced hyporheic responses to dynamically changing discharge events in systems with different bedform geometries exposed to varying degrees of groundwater flow (under both upwelling and downwelling conditions). With this in mind, we define metrics to quantify the effects of transience: spatial extent of the hyporheic zone, net hyporheic flux, mean residence time, and denitrification efficiency. We find that regional groundwater flow and geomorphological settings greatly modulate the temporal evolution of bedform-induced hyporheic responses driven by a single-peak discharge event. Effects of transience diminish with increasing groundwater upwelling or downwelling fluxes, decreasing bedform aspect ratios, and decreasing channel slopes. Additionally, we notice that increasing discharge intensities can reduce the modulating impacts of regional groundwater flow on the effects of transience but hardly overcomes the geomorphological controls. These findings highlight the necessities of evaluating hyporheic exchange processes in a more comprehensive framework.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000456949300004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2BDynamically%2BChanging%2BDischarge%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BProcesses%2BUnder%2BGaining%2Band%2BLosing%2BGroundwater%2BConditions%26rft.aufirst%3DLiwen%26rft.auinit%3DLW%26rft.aulast%3DWu%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR023185%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D10093%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D10076-10093%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D10076%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BLW%26rft.au%3DSingh%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR023185,,"BED FORMS,BIOREACTIVE TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,RESIDENCE TIMES,STREAM,ZONE,WATER,FLOW,TOPOGRAPHY,DRIVEN",,"Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecohydrol, Berlin, Germany"

25,25,"Harrison, AM",Nov 2019 ,Hyporheic Interactions Increase Zinc Exposure and Effects on Hyalella azteca in Sediments under Flow-Through Conditions,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Groundwater-surface water interactions in the hyporheic transition zone can influence contaminant exposure to benthic macroinvertebrates. In streams, hyporheic flows are subject to varying redox conditions, which influence biogeochemical cycling and metal speciation. Despite these relationships, little is known about how these interactions influence the ecological risk of contaminants. The present study investigated the effects of hyporheic flows and zinc (Zn)-contaminated sediments on the amphipod Hyalella azteca. Hyporheic flows were manipulated in laboratory streams during 10-d experiments. Zinc toxicity was evaluated in freshly spiked and aged sediments. Hyporheic flows altered sediment and porewater geochemistry, oxidizing the sediments and causing changes to redox-sensitive endpoints. Amphipod survival was lowest in the Zn sediment exposures with hyporheic flows. In freshly spiked sediments, porewater Zn drove mortality, whereas in aged sediments simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in excess of acid volatile sulfides (AVS) normalized by the fraction of organic carbon (fOC) [(SEM-AVS)/fOC] influenced amphipod responses. The results highlight the important role of hyporheic flows in determining Zn bioavailability to benthic organisms, information that can be important in ecological risk assessments.

26,26,"Swanson, TE",Jul 2010 ,Diel heat transport within the hyporheic zone of a pool-riffle-pool sequence of a losing stream and evaluation of models for fluid flux estimation using heat,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Hyporheic water is thought to infiltrate at the head of a riffle, which in turn is complemented by upwelling back to the stream at the tail of the riffle in a pool-riffle-pool (PRP) sequence. Heat tracing is a potentially useful method to characterize these hyporheic flow paths and quantify associated fluxes. Temperature was monitored within a PRP sequence for several days. Temperature in the hyporheic zone reflected the diel temperature change in the river but not uniformly. The observed thermal pattern exhibited deeper penetration of thermal oscillations below the head pool and shallower penetration below the tail pool. This pattern is consistent with the conceptual model of hyporheic exchange over a PRP sequence. One-dimensional analytical heat transport models were used at different points below the PRP sequence to estimate distributed vertical fluid fluxes. The calculated fluxes exhibit a trend that follows the expected distribution for a PRP sequence but modified for a losing stream (net fluid flux into the streambed). Deviation of both magnitude and distribution of fluxes from the conceptual ""downwelling-to-upwelling"" model is due partly to the dominantly losing conditions at the study site, but the trends are consistent with a losing stream undergoing hyporheic exchange. Violation of the assumptions in the analytical models most likely adds error to flux estimates. For this study, flux estimation methods using a temperature time-series amplitude analysis more closely matched field measurements than phase methods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000283657000022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDiel%2Bheat%2Btransport%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bpool-riffle-pool%2Bsequence%2Bof%2Ba%2Blosing%2Bstream%2Band%2Bevaluation%2Bof%2Bmodels%2Bfor%2Bfluid%2Bflux%2Bestimation%2Busing%2Bheat%26rft.aufirst%3DTravis%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DTE%26rft.aulast%3DSwanson%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.2010.55.4.1741%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D1754%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1741-1754%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1741%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DSwanson%252C%2BTE%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.2010.55.4.1741,,"DESORPTION-KINETICS,ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS,WATER,EXCHANGE,TEMPERATURE,DENITRIFICATION,INTERFACE,SORPTION,RATES",,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA"
27,27,"Ward, AS",Jun 15 2018 ,"Streambed restoration to remove fine sediment alters reach-scale transient storage in a low-gradient fifth-order river, Indiana, USA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hyporheic restoration is of increasing interest given the role of hyporheic zones in supporting ecosystem services and functions. Given the prevalence of sediment pollution to waterways, an emerging restoration technique involves the removal of sediment from the interstices of gravel-bed streams. Here, we document streambed sediment removal following a large, accidental release of fine sediment into a gravel-bed river. We use this as a natural experiment to assess the impact of fine sediment removal on reach-scale measures of transient storage and to document the responses of reaches with contrasting morphology (restored vs. unrestored) to changing discharge one-field season. We conducted a series of conservative solute tracer experiments in each reach, interpreting both summary statistics for the recovered in-stream solute tracer time series. Additionally, we applied the transient storage model to interpret the results via model parameters, including a Monte Carlo analysis to measure parameter identifiability and sensitivity in each experiment. Despite the restoration effort resulting in an open matrix gravel bed in the restored reach, we did not find the significant differences in most time series metrics describing reach-scale transport and transient storage. We hypothesize that this is due to enhanced vertical exchange with the gravel bed in the restored reach replacing lateral exchange with macrophyte beds in the unrestored reach, developing a conceptual model to explain our findings. Consequently, we found that the impact of reach-scale removal of fine sediment is not measureable using reach-scale solute tracer studies. We offer recommendations for future studies seeking to measure the impacts of stream restoration at the reach scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000435783100005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStreambed%2Brestoration%2Bto%2Bremove%2Bfine%2Bsediment%2Balters%2Breach-scale%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bin%2Ba%2Blow-gradient%2Bfifth-order%2Briver%252C%2BIndiana%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.11518%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D1800%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1786-1800%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1786%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DMorgan%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DRoyer%252C%2BTV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.11518,"hyporheic,restoration,sediment,solute,tracer,transient storage","HYPORHEIC ZONE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,WATER EXCHANGE,FLOW,RETENTION,SURFACE,CLASSIFICATION,OPPORTUNITIES,MORPHOLOGY,DISCHARGE",,"Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 430 MSB-2, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA"

Intensive data collection and modeling efforts in the LARB over the past 20 years have resulted in development of the GIS-based basin-scale decision support system River GeoDSS. Parallel efforts in regional-scale calibration and application of the MODFLOW-SFR2-RT3D-OTIS stream-aquifer system model permit evaluation of best management practices (BMPs) designed to mollify adverse environmental impacts. Since BMP implementation is allowable only if water laws are not violated, a deep learning model is developed to serve as an accurate, compute-efficient surrogate of MODFLOW-SFR2 and is imbedded in River GeoDSS for assessing basin-scale impacts of BMP implementations on stream-aquifer exchange and water rights. It is shown that BMPs can be implemented while maintaining reasonable water law compliance with development of a new reservoir storage account.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000498063900012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B104529%26rft.atitle%3DDeep%2Blearning%2Bfor%2Bcompute-efficient%2Bmodeling%2Bof%2BBMP%2Bimpacts%2Bon%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bwater%2Blaw%2Bcompliance%2Bin%2Ban%2Birrigated%2Briver%2Bbasin%26rft.aufirst%3DFaizal%2BI.%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DFIW%26rft.aulast%3DRohmat%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.envsoft.2019.104529%26rft.eissn%3D1873-6726%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1364-8152%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMODELLING%2B%2526%2BSOFTWARE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMODELL%2BSOFTW%26rft.volume%3D122%26rft.au%3DRohmat%252C%2BFIW%26rft.au%3DLabadie%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DGates%252C%2BTK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MODELLING+%26+SOFTWARE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.104529,"Irrigation,Stream-aquifer systems,River basin management,Groundwater modeling,Machine learning,Artificial neural networks,Geographic information systems,Water law compliance","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS,REACTIVE TRANSPORT,SOLUTE-TRANSPORT,GROUNDWATER,SELENIUM,SYSTEM,MANAGEMENT,NITROGEN,NITRATE,FATE",,"Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA"

The manipulation comprised reversing upwelllng and downwelling zones at the riffle scale, and was maintained for I month. Significant differences in physicochemical parameters were detected between zones and between treatments (control vs. manipulated). Depth-related variables, such as sediment particle size, were most important in structuring the hyporheic community during pre- and post-manipulation phases. Flow reversal was largely successful, with more significant changes occurring in the original downwelling zone. For example, change from downwelling to upwelling resulted in decreased larval chironomid dominance but an increase in the numbers of oligochaetes, nematodes, mites, and copepods. However, under field conditions, it was difficult to keep other variables, such as water temperature, constant and some of these may have contributed to the changes seen in the meiofauna.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000232760900019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DResponses%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bmeiofauna%2Bto%2Bhabitat%2Bmanipulation%26rft.aufirst%3DL%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DSliva%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-005-5445-y%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D232%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D217-232%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D217%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D548%26rft.au%3DSliva%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DWilliams%252C%2BDD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-005-5445-y,"hyporheic zone,invertebrates,vertical flow,temperature,field manipulation,meiofauna","SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,ORGANIC-MATTER,ZONE,DYNAMICS,SURFACE,INVERTEBRATES,ECOLOGY",,"Univ Toronto, Dept Life Sci, Surface & Groundwater Ecol Res Grp, 1265 Mil Trail, Scarborough, ON M1C 1A4, Canada"

Still, few studies consider the interactions of transport and transformation together. Here, we consider how diurnal discharge fluctuations in an intermittent, headwater stream control reach-scale solute transport and transformation as measured with conservative and reactive tracers during a period of no precipitation. One common conceptual model is that extended contact times with hyporheic zones during low discharge conditions allows for increased transformation of reactive solutes. Instead, we found tracer timescales within the reach were related to discharge, described by a single discharge-variable StorAge Selection function. We found that Resazurin to Resorufin (Raz-to-Rru) transformation is static in time, and apparent differences in reactive tracer were due to interactions with different ages of storage, not with time-variable reactivity. Overall we found reactivity was highest in youngest storage locations, with minimal Raz-to-Rru conversion in waters older than about 20 h of storage in our study reach. Therefore, not all storage in the study reach has the same potential biogeochemical function and increasing residence time of solute storage does not necessarily increase reaction potential of that solute, contrary to prevailing expectations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000502264500010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2208%26rft.atitle%3DSolute%2BTransport%2Band%2BTransformation%2Bin%2Ban%2BIntermittent%252C%2BHeadwater%2BMountain%2BStream%2Bwith%2BDiurnal%2BDischarge%2BFluctuations%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw11112208%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DKurz%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w11112208,"unsteady-state discharge,solute transport,intermittent stream,diurnal discharge fluctuations,reactive tracers,headwaters,river corridor,hyporheic,resazurin","GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE DYNAMICS,HYPORHEIC ZONE,TRANSIENT-STORAGE,ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES,CASCADE MOUNTAINS,RESIDENCE TIME,BIOFILM GROWTH,WATER-QUALITY,FLOW,NITROGEN",,"Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA"
31,31,"Shi, YZ",Oct 2022 ,Double-coupling learning for multi-task data stream classification,INFORMATION SCIENCES,"Data stream classification methods exploiting cohesion in a single data stream have demonstrated promising performance. However, scenarios involving multiple data streams are indeed common in practice. They involve several correlated data streams and can be viewed as multi-task data streams. Instead of considering them separately as individual data streams, it is beneficial to leverage the correlations among the multi-task data streams in data stream modeling. In this regard, a novel classification method called double -coupling support vector machines (DC-SVM) is proposed to classify multiple data streams simultaneously, where both the external correlations between multiple data streams and the internal relationships within each individual data stream are considered. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world multi-task data streams show that the proposed method outperforms traditional data stream classification methods. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

32,32,"Wallace, CD",Mar 2021 ,Surface water-groundwater exchange dynamics in buried-valley aquifer systems,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Groundwater is a primary source of drinking water worldwide, but excess nutrients and emerging contaminants could compromise groundwater quality and limit its usage as a drinking water source. As such contaminants become increasingly prevalent in the biosphere, a fundamental understanding of their fate and transport in groundwater systems is necessary to implement successful remediation strategies. The dynamics of surface water-groundwater (hyporheic) exchange within a glacial, buried-valley aquifer system are examined in the context of their implications for the transport of nutrients and contaminants in riparian sediments. High conductivity facies act as preferential flow pathways which enhance nutrient and contaminant delivery, especially during storm events, but transport throughout the aquifer also depends on subsurface sedimentary architecture (e.g. interbedded high and low conductivity facies). Temperature and specific conductance measurements indicate extensive hyporheic mixing close to the river channel, but surface water influence was also observed far from the stream-aquifer interface. Measurements of river stage and hydraulic head indicate that significant flows during storms (i.e., hot moments) alter groundwater flow patterns, even between consecutive storm events, as riverbed conductivity and, more importantly, the hydraulic connectivity between the river and aquifer change. Given the similar mass transport characteristics among buried-valley aquifers, these findings are likely representative of glacial aquifer systems worldwide. Our results suggest that water resources management decisions based on average (base) flow conditions may inaccurately represent the system being evaluated, and could reduce the effectiveness of remediation strategies for nutrients and emerging contaminants.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000636346700029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14066%26rft.atitle%3DSurface%2Bwater-groundwater%2Bexchange%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bburied-valley%2Baquifer%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DCorey%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DCD%26rft.aulast%3DWallace%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14066%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DWallace%252C%2BCD%26rft.au%3DSoltanian%252C%2BMR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14066,"buried‐,valley aquifer,groundwater,heterogeneity,hyporheic exchange,riparian,spectral analysis,surface water‐,groundwater interactions,water quality","HETEROGENEITY,STREAM,RIVER,PATTERNS,ZONE",,"Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geol, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA"
33,33,"Tan, K",Dec 2021 ,Variation in processes structuring fish assemblages as inferred from metacommunity analyses: Differences between headwater and adventitious streams within a river network,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Community assembly is generally affected by the spatial position of local patches. Examining metacommunity processes and structures in small streams with different river network positions (e.g., headwater streams in the periphery of river networks vs adventitious streams in relatively central positions) may help us better understand how spatial position influences metacommunity structuring. In this study, based on data collected from sampling 24 headwater and 15 adventitious stream sites in the Xin'an Basin, China, we examined whether and how fish metacommunity processes and structures differed between the 2 stream types. We used distanced-based redundancy analysis coupled with forward selection to assess the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in metacommunity processes, and we applied the elements of metacommunity structure analysis, extended by using different ordinations, to identify metacommunity structures. We found that the 2 types of streams were similar in environmental heterogeneity, but fish assemblages in adventitious streams were more dissimilar to one another than were assemblages in headwater streams and had more riverine immigrants. The amount of among-stream variation in species composition was low in both stream types. In headwater streams, assemblage-environment relationships were stronger than assemblage-space relationships, but we found the opposite pattern in adventitious streams. Species turnover was strong in both headwater and adventitious streams. However, assemblages in headwater streams showed both nested and quasi-nested structures, whereas the assemblages in adventitious streams were more consistent with Clementsian structure. Our results suggest that different metacommunity processes may occur in small streams with distinct river network positions and that extended elements of metacommunity structure analysis can help identify the underlying mechanisms that produce metacommunity structure. The effect of spatial position within river networks on stream fish metacommunity structuring appears to be weak, but our analyses do imply that river immigrants can influence species composition in adventitious streams to some extent.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000710008400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariation%2Bin%2Bprocesses%2Bstructuring%2Bfish%2Bassemblages%2Bas%2Binferred%2Bfrom%2Bmetacommunity%2Banalyses%253A%2BDifferences%2Bbetween%2Bheadwater%2Band%2Badventitious%2Bstreams%2Bwithin%2Ba%2Briver%2Bnetwork%26rft.aufirst%3DKai%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DTan%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F717445%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D625%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D615-625%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D615%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DTan%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BCC%26rft.au%3DYan%252C%2BYZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/717445,"streams,fish,community assembly,assemblage,metacommunity,river networks,adventitious streams","SPATIAL POSITION,ECOLOGICAL DATA,COMMUNITY,DISPERSAL,DIVERSITY,PATTERNS,FRAMEWORK,BASIN,BIODIVERSITY,HYPOTHESIS",,"Anhui Normal Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Recovery & Reconstruct Deg, Sch Ecol & Environm, South Jiuhua Rd 189, Wuhu 241002, Anhui, Peoples R China"
34,34,"Zenagui, I",Jan 2020 ,Nutrient dynamics in a hyporheic zone in response to a severe and prolonged dry period in a semi-arid river (Tafna wadi),ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Against the backdrop of recent climate change issues, the intensity of dry periods is increasing in semi-arid environments due to high temperatures, evaporation and a shortage of precipitation in summer. The Tafna catchment, which is located in north-western Algeria and is characterised by a Mediterranean climate with a sub-dry tendency, has been subject to severe and prolonged dry periods. In order to understand the impact of prolonged dry periods on biogeochemical processes and nutrient exchange between surface water (SW) and hyporheic water (HW) within the (study) catchment, four sets of samples were taken upstream of the Tafna wadi during low-water (LW) periods over two years (2014-2015). Nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and chloride were measured in surface water (SW) and hyporheic water (HW) at depths of 30, 60 and 100 cm. The results showed a significant loss of nitrate and a considerable increase in ammonium in the hyporheic zone (HZ) during these severe conditions. This could be related to (i) high rates of denitrification and (ii) the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). This study indicated that a severe drought directly affects the nitrogen cycle that occurs in a hyporheic zone (HZ), and thus affects the functioning of this area relative to the wadi system as a whole.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000503816100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B35%26rft.atitle%3DNutrient%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Ba%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bin%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Ba%2Bsevere%2Band%2Bprolonged%2Bdry%2Bperiod%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsemi-arid%2Briver%2B%2528Tafna%2Bwadi%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DIbrahim%26rft.auinit%3DI%26rft.aulast%3DZenagui%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-019-8780-4%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D79%26rft.au%3DZenagui%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DBelaidi%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DTaleb%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-019-8780-4,"Biogeochemical process,Hyporheic zone,Dry period,Semi-arid,Tafna wadi,Nitrate","NITROGEN DYNAMICS,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,WATER EXCHANGE,STREAM,FLOW,SEDIMENT,SURFACE,TERRESTRIAL,PERSPECTIVE,CATCHMENT",,"Univ Tlemcen, Lab Ecol & Gest Ecosyst Nat LECGEN, BP 119, Tilimsen 13000, Algeria"

Two tracer methods were applied in each experiment: 2-5 tracer-pulse tests were conducted in all flumes and pulses were monitored at three distances downstream of the flume inlet (0 m, 5 m and 10 m, at bed surface), and in pipes installed into the gravel bed at 5 m and 10 m distances. The tracer breakthrough curves (total of 120 tracer injections) were then analysed with a one-dimensional solute transport model (OTIS) and compared with data from the gravel pipes in point-dilution pulse tests. Sand addition had a strong negative effect on horizontal fluxes (q(h)), whereas the fraction of the median travel time due to transient storage (F-200) was determined more by flow conditions. These results suggest that even small additions of sand can modify the hyporheic zone exchange in gravel beds, thus making headwater streams with low sediment transport capacity particularly vulnerable to sediments transported into the stream from catchment land use activities.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000475454500006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DContribution%2Bof%2Bflow%2Bconditions%2Band%2Bsand%2Baddition%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bgravel%2Bbeds%26rft.aufirst%3DH.%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DMarttila%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fnh.2019.099%26rft.eissn%3D2224-7955%26rft.epage%3D885%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-1277%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D878-885%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D878%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DMarttila%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DTammela%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DKlove%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/nh.2019.099,"flume,hydraulics,modelling,OTIS,sediment,transient storage","FINE SEDIMENT,STREAM,TRANSPORT,RIVER,INFILTRATION,METABOLISM,DEPOSITION,SOLUTES,HABITAT,IMPACT",,"Univ Oulu, Water Energy & Environm Engn Res Unit, POB 3000, Oulu 90014, Finland"
36,36,"Ho, DT",Nov 2011 ,On Factors Controlling Air-Water Gas Exchange in a Large Tidal River,ESTUARIES AND COASTS,"Air-water gas exchange is an important process in aquatic systems, including tidal rivers and estuaries. While there are now reliable and routine methods for determining gas exchange over a range of temporal and spatial scales in the ocean and these measurements have resulted in widely used wind speed parameterizations to calculate air-sea gas exchange, the same has not been true for coastal inland waterways. Some studies have suggested that this difference is methodological, while others point to the existence of additional drivers for gas exchange besides wind in rivers and estuaries. Here, we present gas transfer velocities measured in the tidal Hudson River with a method widely used in oceanic studies, the He-3/SF6 dual tracer technique. Airside and waterside forcings were determined with an anemometer and an acoustic Doppler current profiler, respectively. The results confirm that wind is the dominant driver of gas exchange in the tidal Hudson River, with negligible contribution from bottom-generated turbulence. Furthermore, a parameterization between wind speed and gas exchange developed for the ocean is able to predict gas exchange in this environment with high accuracy. It is hoped that by transferring methodology used in oceanic studies to rivers and estuaries, robust data can be obtained that will eventually allow development of widely applicable relationships between easily measured environmental variables and gas exchange in tidal inland waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000300084700002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2BFactors%2BControlling%2BAir-Water%2BGas%2BExchange%2Bin%2Ba%2BLarge%2BTidal%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DDavid%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DDT%26rft.aulast%3DHo%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12237-011-9396-4%26rft.eissn%3D1559-2731%26rft.epage%3D1116%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1559-2723%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DESTUARIES%2BAND%2BCOASTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1103-1116%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1103%26rft.stitle%3DESTUAR%2BCOAST%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DHo%252C%2BDT%26rft.au%3DSchlosser%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DOrton%252C%2BPM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ESTUARIES+AND+COASTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12237-011-9396-4,"Air-water gas exchange,He-3/SF6,Hudson River","HUDSON RIVER,TRANSFER VELOCITY,SURFACE TURBULENCE,STREAM REAERATION,SF6 TRACER,ESTUARY,CARBON,RATES,COEFFICIENTS,OXYGEN",,"Univ Hawaii, Dept Oceanog, 1000 Pope Rd, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA"
37,37,"Ren, J",Jan 2020 ,"Vertical fluid flux in the hyporheic zone: field investigation, model, and comparative analysis",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is a saturated sediment layer connecting groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) along a riverbed and river channel. The HZ plays an important role in connecting SW and GW in a river ecosystem, thereby helping maintain the ecological health of rivers. Studies on the HZ have therefore increased in many disciplines. This study used the VFLUX 2 software to assess vertical fluid flux in the HZ, in which the Hatch, Kerry, McCallum, and Luce models were applied and compared. The simulations were calibrated against data measured by the US Geological Survey at a water diversion channel within the Walker River Basin in Nevada. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we developed a two-dimensional coupled numerical model of the saturated seepage and temperature fields, calibrated against measured temperature data. We also determined the vertical seepage velocity and compared the simulations with those of the analytical models in VFLUX 2. The results showed that the temperature field distribution of the HZ is obviously nonuniform in space. With a deeper monitoring point, the thermal response of each temperature measurement pointed to periodic temperature fluctuations of the SW, which exhibited attenuation and hysteresis characteristics. When the vertical flow velocity of GW was sufficiently large, an error in the accuracy of the Kerry model amplitude ratio was observed, regardless of the heat dispersion coefficient used. Under conditions of local GW recharge by SW and a heterogeneous permeability coefficient, the use of the amplitude ratio method is recommended to quantify the vertical GW flow rate in the HZ.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000508444600009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B9%26rft.atitle%3DVertical%2Bfluid%2Bflux%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2Bfield%2Binvestigation%252C%2Bmodel%252C%2Band%2Bcomparative%2Banalysis%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12517-019-4990-z%26rft.eissn%3D1866-7538%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-7511%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DARABIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DARAB%2BJ%2BGEOSCI%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BJQ%26rft.au%3DDai%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ARABIAN+JOURNAL+OF+GEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12517-019-4990-z,"Analytical model,Groundwater-surface water interaction,Hyporheic zone numerical model,Vertical seepage velocity","SURFACE-WATER,HYDRAULIC HEADS,TEMPERATURE,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,FLOW,SCIENCE,TRACER,VARIABILITY,ADVECTION",,"Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China"
38,38,"Bottacin-Busolin, A",Aug 10 2010 ,Combined role of advective pumping and mechanical dispersion on time scales of bed form-induced hyporheic exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"This study analyzes the effect of advective pumping and pore scale dispersion on bed form-induced hyporheic exchange. Advection and dispersion play a competitive role in the exchange dynamics between the porous medium and the overlying stream: Advective fluxes first lead solutes deep into the bed and then back to the stream water, whereas dispersive fluxes favor the transfer of solutes deep into the bed leading to a permanent mass retention. The combined effect of advective exchange and dispersive fluxes produces complexity in the shape of the tails of the residence time distributions (RTDs), which follow at various stages of the process either a power law or an exponential decay. The seepage velocity induced by the stream gradient and, in case of a moving bed, the celerity of the translating bed forms limit the thickness of the advective hyporheic zone, inducing the RTDs to decrease rapidly at late time. This rapid decay can be preceded by a temporal region where the probability density functions (pdf's) tend to be inversely proportional to the square of time, and is followed by a region dominated by dispersion where the pdf's tend to be inversely proportional to the 3/2 power of time. The process shows distinct temporal ranges identified here by appropriate dimensionless parameters. Because of this complex exchange dynamics, models considering pure advection in the porous medium can significantly underestimate solute transfer at long time scales, whereas purely diffusive models of hyporheic exchange appear inadequate to represent the physical processes at an intermediate stage.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000280959800005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08518%26rft.atitle%3DCombined%2Brole%2Bof%2Badvective%2Bpumping%2Band%2Bmechanical%2Bdispersion%2Bon%2Btime%2Bscales%2Bof%2Bbed%2Bform-induced%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DBottacin-Busolin%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2009WR008892%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DBottacin-Busolin%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DMarion%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2009WR008892,,"TRANSIENT STORAGE MODEL,RESIDENCE TIME,LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,STREAM,TRANSPORT,FLOW,TIMESCALES,CHANNEL,ZONE",,"Univ Padua, Dept Hydraul Maritime Environm & Geotech Engn, Via Loredan 20, I-35131 Padua, Italy"

In heterogeneous stratified glacial sediments, reach-scale environments contain an uneven distribution of focused groundwater flow occurring simultaneously with diffusely discharging groundwater. This results in a variation of stream-aquifer interactions, where focused flow systems are able to temporally dominate exchange processes. The research presented here investigates the direct and indirect influences focused groundwater discharge exerts on the hyporheic zone during baseflow recession. Field results demonstrate that as diffuse sources of groundwater deplete during baseflow recession, focused groundwater discharge remains constant. During baseflow recession the hyporheic zone is unable to expand, while the high nitrate concentration from focused discharge changes the chemistry of the stream. The final result is a higher concentration of nitrate in the hyporheic zone as this altered surface water infiltrates into the subsurface. This indirect coupling of focused groundwater discharge and the hyporheic zone is unaccounted for in hyporheic studies at this time. Results indicate important implications for the potential reduction of agricultural degradation of water quality.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000350750100007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFocused%2BGroundwater%2BControlled%2BFeedbacks%2Binto%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BDuring%2BBaseflow%2BRecession%26rft.aufirst%3DJonathan%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DMalzone%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12186%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D226%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D217-226%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D217%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DMalzone%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DLowry%252C%2BCS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gwat.12186,,"WATER INTERACTION,SURFACE-WATER,FLOW,EXCHANGE,DENITRIFICATION,NITRIFICATION,DISCHARGE,DYNAMICS,PATTERNS,STREAMS",,"SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geol, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA"

Metabolic and biogeochemical processes in hyporheic zones may depend on inputs of coarse particulate organic matter. Our research focused on how differing quantity and quality of organic matter affects metabolism and nutrient retention in the hyporheic zone of a first-order Appalachian stream.2. Sixteen plots were established on a tributary of Hugh White Creek, NC, U.S.A. Sediment was extracted and treated with leaves, wood, plastic strips or remained unamended. Following treatment, sediment was returned to the stream and, approximately 3 months later, samples were removed from each plot.3. Aerobic and anaerobic metabolism were measured as the change in O-2 and CO2 in recirculating microcosms. At the same time, we monitored other possible terminal electron accepting processes and changes in nutrient concentrations. Aerobic metabolism was low in all treatments and respiratory quotients calculated for all treatments indicated that metabolism was dominated by anaerobic processes.4. Rates of anaerobic respiration and total (combined aerobic and anaerobic) respiration were significantly greater (P < 0.05) in plots treated with leaf organic matter compared to controls.5. Addition of leaves, which had a low C:N ratio, stimulated respiration in hyporheic sediments. Anaerobic processes dominated metabolism in both control and amended sediments. Enhanced metabolic rates increased retention of many solutes, indicating that energy flow and nutrient dynamics in the subsurface of streams may depend upon the quantity and quality of imported carbon.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000178347100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Baugmentation%2Bof%2Bcoarse%2Bparticulate%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bon%2Bmetabolism%2Band%2Bnutrient%2Bretention%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bsediments%26rft.aufirst%3DCL%26rft.auinit%3DCL%26rft.aulast%3DCrenshaw%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.2002.00928.x%26rft.epage%3D1831%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1820-1831%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1820%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DCrenshaw%252C%2BCL%26rft.au%3DValett%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DWebster%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00928.x,"anaerobic contact information,CPOM,hyporheic,metabolism,nutrients","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,LEAF-LITTER,COMMUNITY RESPIRATION,STREAM ECOSYSTEMS,MOUNTAIN STREAM,FOREST STREAM,DESERT STREAM,CARBON,ZONE,DYNAMICS",,"Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
41,41,"Peterson, EW",Mar 2013 ,Factors influencing nitrate within a low-gradient agricultural stream,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"In low-gradient agricultural streams, the proportion of land use devoted to agriculture, the sinuosity of the stream and the time of year influence the concentration of nitrate in the stream waters. Land use influences the source of nitrate and also the morphology of the stream. Greater agricultural land use weakly correlated (r = 0.67) to higher nitrate concentrations. Streams in agricultural areas have been straightened, which decreases the sinuosity. As a stream meanders and becomes more sinuous, the potential for lateral hyporheic flow increases, which can enhance a stream system's ability to remove nitrate. Logically, higher sinuous streams should remove more nitrate and likely sulfate as there is a greater potential for lateral hyporheic flows. To test this hypothesis, nitrate and sulfate were monitored. Mass fluxes of nitrate along six stream segments with varying sinuosity values were calculated and statistically analyzed to assess if differences in mass fluxes along the segments existed. Along the segments, there are statistically significant differences in the mass fluxes of nitrate [F(5,174) = 4.777; p = 0.001]. Stream segments with higher sinuosity index values exhibited a loss or lower gain in nitrate and sulfate than lower sinuosity index segments. The data suggest that stream segments with high sinuosity indices provide greater stream distance and increased hyporheic interaction within the streambed. Additionally, the more sinuous segments provide for an increase in lateral hyporheic flow beneath meander lobes. These additional hyporheic flows lead to enhanced denitrification in low-gradient agricultural streams. Seasonal differences were also noted. August through October experienced the lower nitrate concentrations as compared to June and July which exhibited the highest nitrate concentrations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000314768900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFactors%2Binfluencing%2Bnitrate%2Bwithin%2Ba%2Blow-gradient%2Bagricultural%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DEric%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DEW%26rft.aulast%3DPeterson%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-012-1821-x%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.epage%3D1245%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1233-1245%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1233%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D68%26rft.au%3DPeterson%252C%2BEW%26rft.au%3DBenning%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-012-1821-x,"Hyporheic zone,Meanders,Denitrification,Statistics,Sinuosity,Sulfate,Urban","HYPORHEIC ZONE,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,DENITRIFICATION,CHANNEL,EXPORT,TRANSFORMATIONS,TRANSPORT,EXCHANGE,ILLINOIS,CHLORIDE",,"Illinois State Univ, Dept Geog Geol, Normal, IL 61790 USA"
42,42,"Briggs, MA",Feb 26 2009 ,A method for estimating surface transient storage parameters for streams with concurrent hyporheic storage,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Application of transient storage models has become popular for characterizing hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in streams. The typical transient storage model represents exchange between the main channel and a single storage zone, essentially lumping together different exchange processes. Here we present a method to inform a transient storage model that accounts for two storage zones (2-SZ) to discriminate between surface transient storage (STS) exchange and exchange with hyporheic transient storage (HTS). This method requires that, in addition to tracer breakthrough curves from the main channel, cross-sectional stream velocity distributions and stream tracer concentration time series data from several main channel locations and adjacent representative STS zones be collected. We apply this method to a constant rate conservative tracer injection in a first-order stream and to an instantaneous slug conservative tracer injection in a fourth-order stream. The 2-SZ model simulations matched observed breakthrough curves of tracer concentration in the main channel and general STS behavior well. Additionally, we compared the optimized parameter sets of the 2-SZ model to one-storage zone model (1-SZ) simulations and found that the lumped storage terms of the 1-SZ model described the time scales of 2-SZ model HTS exchange and attributed the time scales of observed STS exchange to longitudinal dispersion. With additional field data collection efforts and data processing, this method can provide much more useful results than the 1-SZ approach to those interested in discriminating between surface and subsurface transient storage dynamics of streams, which is important for discerning processes important to the cycling and fate of biogeochemicals.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000263740800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW00D27%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmethod%2Bfor%2Bestimating%2Bsurface%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bparameters%2Bfor%2Bstreams%2Bwith%2Bconcurrent%2Bhyporheic%2Bstorage%26rft.aufirst%3DMartin%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DMA%26rft.aulast%3DBriggs%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR006959%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DBriggs%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DBaker%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2008WR006959,,"SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,RETENTION,TRANSPORT,ZONE,DYNAMICS,FLOW,TOPOGRAPHY,MODEL",,"Colorado Sch Mines, Hydrol Sci & Engn Program, Golden, CO 80401 USA"
43,43,"Gomez-Velez, JD",Jun 2014 ,Effect of low-permeability layers on spatial patterns of hyporheic exchange and groundwater upwelling,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bed form-induced hyporheic interactions are characterized by a nested system of flow paths that continuously exchange water, solutes, momentum, and energy. At the local scale, sediment heterogeneity plays a key role in the hydrodynamics and potential for biogeochemical transformations within the hyporheic zone. This manuscript explores the role of low-permeability sedimentary layers on the interplay between bed form-induced hyporheic exchange and groundwater upwelling. A hydrodynamic conceptualization that sequentially couples fully-turbulent flow in the water column and Darcian flow in the sediment is used. Low-permeability layers are characterized by long residence times and solute accumulation. Furthermore, these layers induce hydrodynamic sequestration due to the relocation and, in some cases, emergence of new stagnation zones. Spatial patterns of residence time distributions and flushing intensities indicate that the interface of the low-permeability layers has the potential to be a hot spot for biogeochemical transformations and flow acceleration near such interface can increase the mobilization capacity for the products of redox chemical and microbial processes. A discussion about the possible implications that hydrodynamic changes have on the biogeochemistry of hyporheic zones is presented; however, further biogeochemical experimentation and modeling are needed to validate these arguments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000340430400037,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Blow-permeability%2Blayers%2Bon%2Bspatial%2Bpatterns%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Bupwelling%26rft.aufirst%3DJesus%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DGomez-Velez%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR015054%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D5215%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5196-5215%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5196%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DWilson%252C%2BJL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR015054,,"REDUCING MONITORING GAPS,AQUIFER-RIVER INTERFACE,SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,SURFACE-WATER,TECKLENBURG C,KRAUSE S,MUNZ M,FLOW,STREAM",,"US Geol Survey, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA"

Nitrogen cycling,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The objective of this study was to quantify subsurface nitrogen fluxes between a riparian forest and a 4th-order mountain stream, McRae Creek, for each season of the year and during storms. A network of wells was installed on a gravel bar and a portion of the adjacent floodplain between 1989 and 1992. Water samples were collected to monitor dissolved nitrogen concentrations Advected channel water and ground water were enriched in nitrogen relative to the stream; thus, subsurface flow was a net source of nitrogen to the stream in all seasons of the year and during both base-flow periods and storms. Estimates of the flux of advected channel water and the discharge of ground water were combined with changes in mean nitrogen concentrations along subsurface flow paths to estimate nitrogen inputs to the stream. Discharge of ground water from the conifer-dominated floodplain was the largest source of nitrogen added to the stream; however, more than 50% of this nitrogen was dissolved organic nitrogen. In contrast, two-thirds of the nitrogen from the alder-dominated gravel bar was inorganic. Net nitrogen fluxes from the gravel bar to the stream were lowest during the summer when water table elevations were low. Net fluxes of nitrogen from the gravel bar to the stream were largest during the fall, especially at peak flow during storms when interstitial water in the gravel bar was enriched in NO3-. The estimated annual flux of nitrogen from the riparian forest to McRae Creek was 1.9 g/m(2) of streambed, of which 1.0 g/m(2) was inorganic. Estimated net annual flux was large relative to the estimated input of nitrogen in litterfall, or the nitrogen required to support estimated rates of primary productivity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1996TX71600002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSeasonal%2Band%2Bstorm%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2B4th-order%2Bmountain%2Bstream%2B.2.%2BNitrogen%2Bcycling%26rft.aufirst%3DSM%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DWondzell%26rft.date%3D1996%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1467430%26rft.epage%3D34%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D20-34%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D20%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DSwanson%252C%2BFJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1467430,"hyporheic zone,nutrient dynamics,nitrogen cycling,riparian forest,ground water,hydrologic exchange,hydrology","SOLUTE TRANSPORT,3RD-ORDER STREAM,TROPICAL SOIL,EXCHANGE,NITRATE,WATER,FLOW,METABOLISM,CALIFORNIA,CATCHMENTS",,"OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT FOREST SCI,CORVALLIS,OR 97331, USA"
45,45,"Vautier, C",Feb 2020 ,Mapping gas exchanges in headwater streams with membrane inlet mass spectrometry,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Using continuous injections of helium coupled to in-situ continuous flow membrane inlet mass spectrometry (CF-MIMS), we mapped the gas exchanges along two low-slope headwater streams having discharges of 25 L s(-1) and 90 L s(-1). Mean reaeration rate coefficients (k(2)) were estimated at 130 d(-1) and 60 d(-1), respectively. Our study revealed that gas exchanges along headwater streams are highly heterogeneous. The variable morphology of the streambed causes gas exchanges to be focused into small areas, namely small cascades made up of stones or wood, with reaeration rate coefficients up to 40 times higher than in low-turbulent zones. As such, cascades appear to be hot spots for both oxygenation and greenhouse gases emissions. Additional O-2 and CO2 measurements effectively showed fast exchanges between the stream and the atmosphere in the cascades, following the partial pressure gradients. These cascades allow a fast oxygenation of the eutrophic streams depleted in O-2, which sustains respiration. Simultaneously, cascades release the oversaturated CO2 originating from groundwater inputs to the atmosphere. By comparing measured reaeration rate coefficients to ten predictive equations from literature, we showed that all equations systematically underestimate reaeration rate coefficients, with significantly higher discrepancies in cascades than in low-turbulent zones. The inadequate characterization of the processes occurring in cascades causes empirical equations to have poor predictive capabilities, leading to a global underestimation of CO2 emission from headwater streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000514758300053,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124398%26rft.atitle%3DMapping%2Bgas%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%2Bwith%2Bmembrane%2Binlet%2Bmass%2Bspectrometry%26rft.aufirst%3DCamille%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DVautier%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2019.124398%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D581%26rft.au%3DVautier%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DAbherve%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3Dde%2BDreuzy%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124398,"Headwater stream,Membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS),Reaeration,Gas exchange,Greenhouse gas emission,CO2 evasion","CO2 EVASION,DISSOLVED-GASES,OXYGEN-TRANSFER,REAERATION-RATE,CARBON-DIOXIDE,HUDSON RIVER,WATER,TRACER,METABOLISM,RATES",,"Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France"
46,46,"Korbel, KL",Mar 10 2022 ,Dynamics of microbiotic patterns reveal surface water groundwater interactions in intermittent and perennial streams,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Exchange between groundwater (GW), hyporheic zone waters (HZ) and surface waters (SW) is critical for water quality, quantity, and the ecological health and functioning of all three ecosystems. Hydrological exchange is particularly important in intermittent creeks, such as in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia, where stream reaches shift from losing to gaining depending on the volume of surface flows. In this study we used hydrochemistry to identify SW-GW exchange and combined this with eDNA data to analyse the response of eukaryote and prokaryote communities to differing flow conditions within intermittent and perennial stream reaches. Our study suggested that SW and GW microbial communities were only around 30% similar. Differences in microbiota between SW, HZ and GW habitats were driven by changes in relative abundances of surface water dominant organisms (such as those capable of photosynthesis) as well as anaerobic taxa typical of GW environments (e.g., methanogens), with GW and HZ microbial communities becoming increasingly different to those in SW as flow ceased in intermittent creeks. Fine-scale hydrologic changes were identified through microbial communities in the perennial Maules Creek, indicating the importance of GW-SW exchange to biotic communities. This study highlights the importance of flow in shaping microbial communities and biogeochemical cycling within intermittent creeks and their connected alluvial aquifers. Our results suggest that microbiota may prove a useful indicator of SW-GW exchange, and in some circumstances, may be more sensitive in demonstrating fine-scale changes in SW-GW interactions than water chemistry. This knowledge furthers our understanding of GW-SW exchange and its impacts on ecological health.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000740212200006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B152380%26rft.atitle%3DDynamics%2Bof%2Bmicrobiotic%2Bpatterns%2Breveal%2Bsurface%2Bwater%2Bgroundwater%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Bintermittent%2Band%2Bperennial%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DK.%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DKL%26rft.aulast%3DKorbel%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.scitotenv.2021.152380%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1026%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0048-9697%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENCE%2BOF%2BTHE%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D811%26rft.au%3DKorbel%252C%2BKL%26rft.au%3DRutlidge%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DAndersen%252C%2BMS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=SCIENCE+OF+THE+TOTAL+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152380,"Intermittent,Groundwater,Connectivity,Microbes,eDNA,Hyporheic","HYPORHEIC ZONE,DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS,BACTERIAL COMMUNITY,RIVERS,BIODIVERSITY,RECHARGE,AQUIFERS,ECOLOGY,CONNECTIVITY,EXCHANGE",,"Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia"

Preflood versus postflood comparisons were made in three study reaches from well networks established before and reestablished after a major flood. Flood effects were scale dependent and varied with channel constraint and the dominant channel forming process. Large changes were observed in unconstrained stream reaches where channel incision drove large changes in subsurface flow paths and the extent of the hyporheic zone. However, subreach scale differences were apparent. In the lower portion of the studied reach, channel incision lowered the water table, leading to abandonment of secondary channels, and decreased the extent of the hyporheic zone that previously extended more than 30 m into the floodplain. In contrast, the extent of the hyporheic zone increased at the head of the studied reach where channel incision steepened head gradients through a meander bend. In another unconstrained reach, lateral channel jumps dramatically altered exchange flow paths. However, the extensive hyporheic zone was maintained throughout the reach. Less change was observed in the constrained stream reach where both the depth and area of sediment available to be reworked by the flood were limited by bedrock constraining the width of the valley floor. This flood dramatically changed the hyporheic zone at the three study sites and these physical changes are expected to be biologically important, considering the role of the hyporheic zone in stream ecosystem processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000078220800019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFloods%252C%2Bchannel%2Bchange%252C%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DSM%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DWondzell%26rft.date%3D1999%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F1998WR900047%26rft.epage%3D567%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D555-567%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D555%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DSwanson%252C%2BFJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/1998WR900047,,"4TH-ORDER MOUNTAIN STREAM,COARSE WOODY DEBRIS,LOTIC DISTURBANCE,HEADWATER STREAMS,3RD-ORDER STREAM,WATER EXCHANGE,STORM DYNAMICS,SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER,RETENTION",,"US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, USDA, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA"

Forecasting the river hydrodynamic changes is critical for flood management under climate change and intensified human activities. However, efficient and accurate river modeling is challenging, especially with complex lake boundary conditions and uncontrolled downstream boundary conditions. Here, we proposed a coupled framework by taking the advantages of interpretability of physical hydrodynamic modeling and the adaptability of machine learning. Specifically, we coupled the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a 1-D HydroDynamic model (GRU-HD) and applied it to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest river in China. We show that the GRU-HD model could quickly and accurately simulate the water levels, streamflow, and water exchange rates between the Yangtze River and two important lakes (Poyang and Dongting), with most of the Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE $\mathrm{K}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{E}$) above 0.90. Using machine learning-based predicted water levels, instead of the rating curve approach, as the downstream boundary conditions could improve the accuracy of modeling the downstream water levels of the lake-connected river system. The GRU-HD model is dedicated to the synergy of physical modeling and machine learning, providing a powerful avenue for modeling rivers with complex boundary conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000864162000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2022WR032183%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BMachine%2BLearning%2BInto%2BHydrodynamic%2BModels%2Bto%2BImprove%2BRiver%2BModeling%2BWith%2BComplex%2BBoundary%2BConditions%26rft.aufirst%3DSheng%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DHuang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2022WR032183%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DXia%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BGS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2022WR032183,"river modeling,machine learning,hydrodynamic models,water exchange,downstream boundary conditions","LAKE WATER-LEVEL,3 GORGES DAM,YANGTZE-RIVER,POYANG LAKE,BLACK-BOX,FLOW,UNCERTAINTY,ROUGHNESS,DISCHARGE,REGRESSION",,"Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan, Peoples R China"
49,49,"Boon, PJ",Feb 2016 ,The regional hyporheic fauna of gravel-bed rivers and environmental controls on its distribution,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) of rivers is important for functional processes and a critical habitat for a specialist biota (the hyporheos). Knowledge of the hyporheos and its variability within and between rivers, however, remains limited at all scales. This paper describes an extensive survey of the invertebrate fauna and the physicochemical characteristics of the HZ, through sampling 25 geographically dispersed Scottish rivers. Invertebrates were collected using two techniques for comparison of depth of sampling and effectiveness of invertebrate retrieval: Bou-Rouch pumping using standpipes inserted to 0.5 m depth and Karaman-Chappuis pit sampling. The faunal assemblage was dominated by Oligochaeta, cyclopoid Copepoda, Nematoda and Diptera, which accounted for almost 80 % of individuals. The fauna of pits and standpipes was influenced by different but related variables; distance to source and source altitude were strong predictors of pit faunal composition, compared with site altitude and longitude in standpipes. These factors suggest a general biogeographical component to the composition of the hyporheos. Pit assemblages were also influenced by conductivity, and standpipes by total alkalinity, implying a secondary influence of water chemistry or productivity. Explained variation in faunal composition in standpipes was significantly greater than for pits suggesting a higher degree of environmental determinism and associated specialization within the deeper hyporheos. Faunal richness was positively correlated with dissolved oxygen saturation in pit and pipe samples highlighting potential sensitivity to temperature-related effects, siltation and eutrophication. Inclusion of hyporheic sampling in biological assessments might result in greater nature conservation significance being attributed to the hyporheos, thus supporting a call for greater recognition of the HZ and its associated services in environmental protection.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000370959900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bregional%2Bhyporheic%2Bfauna%2Bof%2Bgravel-bed%2Brivers%2Band%2Benvironmental%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bits%2Bdistribution%26rft.aufirst%3DPhilip%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DPJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoon%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252Ffal%252F2016%252F0705%26rft.epage%3D239%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D223-239%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D223%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D187%26rft.au%3DBoon%252C%2BPJ%26rft.au%3DWillby%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DPryce%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A84ilPQcCZhwq0ifln8mzT&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/fal/2016/0705,"Hyporheos,Scotland,Invertebrates,Gravel-bed rivers,Meiofauna,Bou-Rouch sampling,Standpipes,Karaman-Chappuis pit sampling","INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,GREAT-BRITAIN,GROUNDWATER,STREAMS,ZONE,PREDICTION,EXCHANGE,HABITAT,FLOOD",,"Scottish Nat Heritage, Silvan House,231 Corstorphine Rd, Edinburgh EH12 7AT, Midlothian, Scotland"
