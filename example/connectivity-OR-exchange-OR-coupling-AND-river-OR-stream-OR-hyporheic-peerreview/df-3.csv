0,"Siergieiev, D",2014 ,Hyporheic water exchange in a large hydropower-regulated boreal river - directions and rates,HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,"Widespread river regulation is known to modify river-aquifer interactions, influencing entire watersheds, but knowledge of the hyporheic flowpath along regulated rivers is limited. This study measured the hydraulic conductivity of the river bed and the aquifer, water levels and seepage fluxes in the heavily regulated Lule River in Northern Sweden, with the aim of characterising water exchange across the river-aquifer interface. While pristine rivers in the area are gaining, the Lule River was recharging the aquifer during 10% of the time. Daily river level fluctuations (typically +/- 0.25 m) directed similar to 3% of the total orthogonal flux across the river bed towards the aquifer, while during similar to 2% of the time the orthogonal fluxes were negligible (<= 10(-4) m d(-1)). A clogging layer on the river bed, most likely formed due to the modified river discharge, restricted river-aquifer exchange. The hyporheic zone had higher electrical conductivity than the river and the aquifer and electrical conductivity occasionally decreased following rising river water levels, with 3-5 hours' delay. Overall, hydropower regulation has severely altered the hydrological regime of the hyporheic zone in the Lule River.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000338913600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bhydropower-regulated%2Bboreal%2Briver%2B-%2Bdirections%2Band%2Brates%26rft.aufirst%3DD.%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DSiergieiev%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fnh.2013.011%26rft.eissn%3D2224-7955%26rft.epage%3D348%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-1277%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D334-348%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D334%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DSiergieiev%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DLundberg%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DWiderlund%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Cozzetto, K",Feb 2006 ,"Experimental investigations into processes controlling stream and hyporheic temperatures, Fryxell Basin, Antarctica",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Glacial meltwater streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica exhibit daily cycles in temperature with maxima frequently reaching 10-15 degrees C, often 10 degrees C above air temperatures. Hydrologic and biogeochemical processes occurring in these streams and their hyporheic zones strongly influence the flux of water, solutes, and sediment to the ice-covered lakes on the valley bottoms. The purpose of this study was to identify the dominant processes controlling water temperature in these polar desert streams and to investigate in particular the role of hyporheic exchange. In order to do this, we analyzed stream temperature patterns on basin-wide, longitudinal, and reach scales. In the basin-wide study, we examined stream temperature monitoring data for seven streams in the Lake Fryxell Basin. For the longitudinal study, we measured temperatures at seven sites along a 5-km length of Von Guerard Stream.Maximum temperatures in the Fryxell Basin streams ranged from 8 to 15 degrees C. Daily temperature changes in the streams averaged 6-9 degrees C. Stream temperature patterns showed strong diel cycles peaking at roughly the same time throughout the lake basin as well as along the longitudinal gradient of Von Guerard Stream. Further, temperature patterns closely matched the associated net shortwave radiation patterns. Von Guerard Stream experienced its greatest amount of warming, 3-6 degrees C, in a playa region and cooled below snowfields. Temperatures in several streams around Lake Fryxell converged on similar values for a given day as did temperatures in downstream reaches of Von Guerard Stream not influenced by snowfields suggesting that at a certain point instream warming and cooling processes balance one another. The reach-scale investigation involved conducting two dual-injection conservative tracer experiments at mid-day in a 143-m reach of Von Guerard Stream instrumented with temperature and specific conductance probes. In one experiment, snow was added to the stream to suppress the temperature maximum. Chloride data from monitoring wells installed in the streambed showed that streamwater was infiltrating into the streambed and was reaching the frozen boundary. Temperatures in the hyporheic zone were always cooler than temperatures in the stream. OTIS-P modeling of tracer experiment data indicated that significant hyporheic exchange occurred in both experiments. Reach and cross-sectional heat budgets were established with data obtained from the tracer experiments and from a nearby meteorological station. The budgets showed that net radiation accounted for 99% of the warming taking place in the experimental reach. This result, together with the streams' shallow depths and hence rapid response to meteorological conditions, explains the close linkage between stream temperature and net shortwave radiation patterns. Cross-sectional heat budgets also indicated that evaporation, convection, conduction, and hyporheic exchange contributed to 30%, 25-31%, 19-37%, and 6-21%, respectively, of the non-radiative heat losses in the experimental reach. Thus these processes all worked in conjunction to limit stream temperatures in the Dry Valleys' highly exposed environment. This contrasts with other streams in which convection and conduction may play a warming role. The cooling impact of hyporheic exchange was greater in a losing reach than in a gaining one, and increased hyporheic exchange may have lessened the contribution of conduction to the thermal budgets by decreasing streambed temperature gradients. The cooling contributions of evaporation and convection increased with stream temperature and may thus play a role in constraining stream temperature maxima. Finally, our data indicate that streams act as vectors of heat in the Lake Fryxell basin, not only warming the hyporheic zone and eroding the frozen boundary underlying the streams but also accumulating and carrying heat downstream, sending a thermal wave into the lake once a day.

2,"Cook, S",Dec 20 2020 ,Bedform characteristics and biofilm community development interact to modify hyporheic exchange,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The physical and biological attributes of riverine ecosystems interact in a complex manner which can affect the hydrodynamic behaviour of the system. This can alter the mixing characteristics of a river at the sediment-water interface. Research on hyporheic exchange has increased in recent years driven by a greater appreciation for the importance of this dynamic ecotone in connecting and regulating river systems. An understanding of process-based interactions driving hyporheic exchange is still limited, specifically the feedbacks between the physical and biological controlling factors. The interplay between bed morphology and sediment size on biofilm community development and the impact on hyporheic exchange mechanisms, was experimentally considered. Purpose built recirculating flume systems were constructed and three profiles of bedform investigated: i) flat, ii) undulating lambda = 1 m, ii) undulating lambda = 0.2 m, across two different sized sediments (0.5 mm and 5 mm). The influence of biofilm growth and bedform interaction on hyporheic exchange was explored, over time, using discrete repeat injections of fluorescent dye into the flumes. Hyporheic exchange rates were greatest in systems with larger sediment sizes (5 mm) and with more bedforms (undulating lambda = 0.2). Sediment size was a dominant control in governing biofilm growth and hyporheic exchange in systems with limited bedform. In systems where bedform was prevalent, sediment size and biofilm appeared to no longer be a control on exchange clue to the physical influence of advective pumping. Here, exchange rates within these environments were more consistent overtime, despite greater microbial growth. As such, bedform has the potential to overcome the rate limiting effects of biotic factors on hyporheic exchange and sediment size on microbial penetration. This has implications for pollutant and nutrient penetration; bedforms increase hydrological connectivity, generating the opportunity to support microbial communities at depth and as such, improve the self-purification ability of river systems.

3,"Hill, AR",Feb 1998 ,Hyporheic zone chemistry and stream-subsurface exchange in two groundwater-fed streams,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Data from two headwater streams in southern Ontario provide support for conceptual models that suggest that hyporheic zone influence on stream nutrient retention is determined by the extent of surface-groundwater exchange and subsurface chemical transformation rates. The hyporheic zone (>10% stream water) was delineated by a chemical mixing equation using differences in background stream and groundwater chloride concentrations and by injections of chloride to stream flow. Good agreement between the two methods confirmed that the extent of stream-groundwater exchanges can be successfully estimated using background conservative ions as a tracer technique. During low stream flows in May-October the depth of the hyporheic zone was 2-15 cm in a 12-m sand-bottom pool, debris dam, pool reach of Glen Major stream and 15-20 cm in a 16-m gravel riffle reach of Duffin Creek. Differences between observed NO3 concentrations and concentrations predicted from background chloride indicated depletion of NO3 in the hyporheic zone at a few locations in Glen Major and at 5-10 cm depth throughout the Duffin Creek reach. NO3 and NH4 injected into stream water were reactive at only a few hyporheic sites in the streams. Upstream-downstream comparisons during injections indicated that stream retention was minor.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000073611000022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bzone%2Bchemistry%2Band%2Bstream-subsurface%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Btwo%2Bgroundwater-fed%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAR%26rft.auinit%3DAR%26rft.aulast%3DHill%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252Fcjfas-55-2-495%26rft.epage%3D506%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D495-506%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D495%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DHill%252C%2BAR%26rft.au%3DLymburner%252C%2BDJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Salehin, M",Nov 4 2004 ,Hyporheic exchange with heterogeneous streambeds: Laboratory experiments and modeling,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[ 1] Hyporheic exchange is generally analyzed with the assumption of a homogeneous hyporheic zone. In reality, streambed sediments have a heterogeneous structure, and this natural heterogeneity produces spatially variable interfacial fluxes and complex hyporheic exchange patterns. To assess the basic effects of sediment structure on hyporheic exchange, we performed salt and dye injection experiments in a recirculating laboratory flume with two heterogeneous sediment beds characterized by negative-exponential correlated random hydraulic conductivity fields. Dye injections showed that the hyporheic flow structure was controlled by the spatial relationship of bed forms to high-and low-permeability regions of the streambed. As no existing model could represent these effects, we developed a new finite element model to calculate the pore water flow field resulting from the interaction of the bed form-induced boundary head distribution and the heterogeneous sediment structure. A numerical particle-tracking approach was then used to assess the resulting hyporheic exchange. The combined flow-transport model did an excellent job of predicting the complex hyporheic flow pathways in the heterogeneous bed and the net hyporheic exchange up to t approximate to 30 hours. The heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field caused both greater spatial variability in the water flux through the bed surface and a greater average interfacial flux than would have occurred with a homogeneous bed. The layered correlation structure of the streambed produced an effective anisotropy that favored longitudinal pore water flow and caused a relatively rapid decrease of the mean pore water velocity with depth. As a result, solute penetration into the bed was confined to a more shallow region than would have occurred with a homogeneous bed. The combination of faster near-surface transport and shallower solute penetration produced a shorter mean hyporheic residence time. On the basis of the combination of experimental results and model simulations we conclude that the structural heterogeneity of streambed sediments produces more spatially limited hyporheic exchange that occurs with greater spatial variability and at a higher overall rate.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000225034000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW11504%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bwith%2Bheterogeneous%2Bstreambeds%253A%2BLaboratory%2Bexperiments%2Band%2Bmodeling%26rft.aufirst%3DM%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DSalehin%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2003WR002567%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DSalehin%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DParadis%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"Ingendahl, D",Dec 2009 ,Vertical hydraulic exchange and the contribution of hyporheic community respiration to whole ecosystem respiration in the River Lahn (Germany),AQUATIC SCIENCES,"To quantify the contribution of hyporheic community respiration to whole running-water ecosystem respiration in a cultural landscape setting, we studied the vertical hydraulic exchange in riffle-pool sequences of the River Lahn (Germany). We used flow through curves from four tracer experiments to estimate flow velocities in the surface and subsurface water. Generally, vertical exchange velocities were higher in riffle sections and a high temporal variability was observed (range of values 0.11-1.08 m day(-1)). We then used (1) the exchange velocities and (2) time series of dissolved oxygen concentration in surface and subsurface water to calculate hyporheic respiration. Hyporheic respiration was estimated in a range of 10-50 mg O-2 m(-3) day(-1) for the upper sediment layer (first 20 cm). It was much lower in the deeper sediment layer (20-40 cm), ranging from 0 to 10 mg O-2 m(-3) day(-1) (volumes are volumes of interstitial water; the average porosity was 20%). We determined primary production and respiration of the biofilm growing on the sediment by modelling dissolved oxygen concentration time series for a 2,450 m long stream reach (dissolved oxygen concentrations with diurnal variations from 8 to 16 mg L-1). Modelled respiration rates ranged from 2 to 21 g O-2 m(2) day(-1). All information was integrated in a system analysis with numerical simulations of respiration with and without sediments. Results indicated that hyporheic respiration accounted for 6 to 14% of whole ecosystem respiration. These values are much lower than in other whole system respiration studies on more oligotrophic river systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000271261300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVertical%2Bhydraulic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bthe%2Bcontribution%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bcommunity%2Brespiration%2Bto%2Bwhole%2Becosystem%2Brespiration%2Bin%2Bthe%2BRiver%2BLahn%2B%2528Germany%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DDetlev%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DIngendahl%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-009-0116-0%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D410%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D399-410%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D399%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D71%26rft.au%3DIngendahl%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DBorchardt%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DReichert%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
6,"Lautz, LK",Jan 2006 ,Impact of debris dams on hyporheic interaction along a semi-arid stream,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hyporheic exchange increases the potential for solute retention in streams by slowing downstream transport and increasing solute contact with the substrate. Hyporheic exchange may be a major mechanism to remove nutrients in semi-arid watersheds, where livestock have damaged stream riparian zones and contributed nutrients to stream channels. Debris dams, such as beaver dams and anthropogenic log dams, may increase hyporheic interactions by slowing stream water velocity, increasing flow complexity and diverting water to the subsurface.Here, we report the results of chloride tracer injection experiments done to evaluate hyporheic interaction along a 320 m reach of Red Canyon Creek, a second order stream in the semi-arid Wind River Range of Wyoming. The study site is part of a rangeland watershed managed by The Nature Conservancy of Wyoming, and used as a hydrologic field site by the University of Missouri Branson Geologic Field Station. The creek reach we investigated has debris dams and tight meanders that hypothetically should enhance hyporheic interaction. Breakthrough curves of chloride measured during the field experiment were modelled with OTIS-P, a one-dimensional, surface-water, solute-transport model from which we extracted the storage exchange rate alpha and cross-sectional area of the storage zone A(s) for hyporheic exchange. Along gaining reaches of the stream reach, short-term hyporheic interactions associated with debris dams were comparable to those associated with severe meanders. In contrast, along the non-gaining reach, stream water was diverted to the subsurface by debris dams and captured by large-scale near-stream flow paths. Overall, hyporheic exchange rates along Red Canyon Creek during snowmelt recession equal or exceed exchange rates observed during baseflow at other streams.

7,"Ward, AS",Mar 30 2010 ,Imaging hyporheic zone solute transport using electrical resistivity,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Traditional characterization of hyporheic processes relies upon modelling observed in-stream and subsurface breakthrough curves to estimate hyporheic zone size and infer exchange rates. Solute data integrate upstream behaviour and lack spatial coverage, limiting our ability to accurately quantify spatially heterogeneous exchange dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the application of near-surface electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) methods, coupled with experiments using an electrically conductive stream tracer (dissolved NaCl), to provide in situ imaging of spatial and temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange. Tracer-labelled water in the stream enters the hyporheic zone, reducing electrical resistivity in the subsurface (to which subsurface ERI is sensitive). Comparison of background measurements with those recording tracer presence provides distributed characterization of hyporheic area (in this application, similar to 0.5 m(2)). Results demonstrate the first application of ERI for two-dimensional imaging of stream-aquifer exchange and hyporheic extent. Future application of this technique will greatly enhance our ability to quantify processes controlling solute transport and fate in hyporheic zones, and provide data necessary to inform more complete numerical models.

8,"Cardenas, MB",Jun 27 2009 ,Stream-aquifer interactions and hyporheic exchange in gaining and losing sinuous streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The irregular planform morphology of rivers leads to formation of hyporheic zones along its banks. This study investigates how hyporheic exchange in stream banks, whose planform is idealized as sinusoidal, is affected by net gains from and net losses of water to the adjacent aquifer. These effects are studied via numerical modeling of groundwater flow adjacent to sinuous channels across a broad range of sinuosity and gain/loss magnitude. Hyporheic zone areas and fluxes both decrease exponentially with increasing magnitude of net gain or loss relative to the case where the stream has no net flux of water (neutral). Residence time through the hyporheic zone also decreases with gain/loss magnitude. The hyporheic zones become constrained near the apex of bends, indicating that these areas could be hot spots for mixing and biogeochemical processing. Hyporheic zones in channels with smaller sinuosity are more prone to hyporheic flux and area reduction while very sinuous channels are able to maintain a hyporheic zone even under largely losing or gaining conditions. Equations fitted to the suite of simulation results allow for prediction of hyporheic flux, area, and residence time on the basis of aquifer hydraulic conductivity, channel sinuosity, and the ratio of along-valley and across-valley mean head gradients.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000267492700002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW06429%26rft.atitle%3DStream-aquifer%2Binteractions%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bgaining%2Band%2Blosing%2Bsinuous%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BBayani%26rft.auinit%3DMB%26rft.aulast%3DCardenas%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007651%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D45&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
9,"Greenwald, MJ",Jun 11 2008 ,Hyporheic exchange and water chemistry of two arctic tundra streams of contrasting geomorphology,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"The North Slope of Alaska's Brooks Range is underlain by continuous permafrost, but an active layer of thawed sediments develops at the tundra surface and beneath streambeds during the summer, facilitating hyporheic exchange. Our goal was to understand how active layer extent and stream geomorphology influence hyporheic exchange and nutrient chemistry. We studied two arctic tundra streams of contrasting geomorphology: a high-gradient, alluvial stream with riffle-pool sequences and a low-gradient, peat-bottomed stream with large deep pools connected by deep runs. Hyporheic exchange occurred to similar to 50 cm beneath the alluvial streambed and to only similar to 15 cm beneath the peat streambed. The thaw bulb was deeper than the hyporheic exchange zone in both stream types. The hyporheic zone was a net source of ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus in both stream types. The hyporheic zone was a net source of nitrate in the alluvial stream, but a net nitrate sink in the peat stream. The mass flux of nutrients regenerated from the hyporheic zones in these two streams was a small portion of the surface water mass flux. Although small, hyporheic sources of regenerated nutrients help maintain the in-stream nutrient balance. If future warming in the arctic increases the depth of the thaw bulb, it may not increase the vertical extent of hyporheic exchange. The greater impacts on annual contributions of hyporheic regeneration are likely to be due to longer thawed seasons, increased sediment temperatures or changes in geomorphology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000256812100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG02029%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bwater%2Bchemistry%2Bof%2Btwo%2Barctic%2Btundra%2Bstreams%2Bof%2Bcontrasting%2Bgeomorphology%26rft.aufirst%3DMorgan%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DGreenwald%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2007JG000549%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3DG2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D113%26rft.au%3DGreenwald%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DBowden%252C%2BWB%26rft.au%3DBrosten%252C%2BTR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Hanrahan, TP",Jan 1 2008 ,Effects of river discharge on hyporheic exchange flows in salmon spawning areas of a large gravel-bed river,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The flow magnitude and timing from hydroelectric dams in the Snake River Basin of the Pacific north-western US is managed in part for the benefit of salmon. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of Hells Canyon Dam discharge operations on hydrologic exchange flows between the river and riverbed in Snake River fall Chinook salmon spawning areas. Interactions between river water and pore water within the upper 1 m of the riverbed were quantified through the use of self-contained temperature and water level data loggers suspended inside of piezometers. The data were recorded at 20 min intervals over a period of 200 days when the mean daily discharge was 218-605 m(3) s(-1), with hourly stage changes as large as 1.9 m. Differences in head pressure between the river and rivet-bed were small, often within +/- 2 cm. Measured temperature gradients in the riverbed indicated significant interactions between the surface and subsurface water. At the majority of sites, neither hydraulic not, temperature gradients were significantly affected by either short- or long-term changes in discharge operations from Hells Canyon Dam. Only 2 of 14 study sites exhibited acute flux reversals between the river and riverbed resulting from short-term, large magnitude changes in discharge. The findings suggest that local scale measurements may not be wholly explanatory of the hydrological exchange between the river and riverbed. The processes controlling surface water exchange at the Study sites are likely to be bedform-induced advective pumping, turbulence at the riverbed surface, and large-scale hydraulic gradients along the longitudinal profile of the riverbed. By incorporating the knowledge of hydrological exchange processes into water management planning, regional agencies will be better prepared to manage the limited water resources among competing priorities that include salmon recovery, flood control, irrigation supply, hydropower production, and recreation.

11,"Doughty, M",Aug 2020 ,Mapping increases in hyporheic exchange from channel-spanning logjams,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Human impacts such as timber harvesting, channel engineering, beaver removal, and urbanization alter the physical and chemical characteristics of streams. These anthropogenic changes have reduced the number of fallen trees and amount of loose wood that form blockages in streams. Logjams increase hydraulic resistance and create hydraulic head gradients along the streambed that drive groundwater-surface water exchange. Here, we quantify changes in hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) due to a channel-spanning logjam using field measurements and numerical modeling in MODFLOW and MT3DMS. Electrical resistivity (ER) imaging was used to monitor the transport of solutes into the hyporheic zone during a series of in-stream tracer tests supplemented by in-stream monitoring. We conducted experiments in two reaches in Lithe Beaver Creek, Colorado (USA): one with a single, channel-spanning logjam and the second at a control reach with no logjams. Our results show that 1) higher HEF occurred at the reach with a logjam, 2) logjams created complex HEF pathways that caused bimodal solute breakthrough behavior downstream, and 3) higher discharge rates associated with spring snowmelt increased the extent and magnitude of HEF. Our numerical modeling supported all three field findings, and also suggested that lower flows increased solute retention in streams, although this last conclusion was not supported by field results. This study represents the first use of ER to explore HEF around a naturally occurring logjam over different stream discharges, and has implications for understanding how logjams influence the transport of solutes, the health of stream ecosystems, and stream restoration and conservation efforts.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000568819100058,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124931%26rft.atitle%3DMapping%2Bincreases%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bfrom%2Bchannel-spanning%2Blogjams%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DDoughty%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.124931%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D587%26rft.au%3DDoughty%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DSingha%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
12,"Toran, L",Feb 2012 ,Using Hydrogeophysics to Monitor Change in Hyporheic Flow around Stream Restoration Structures,ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE,"Hyporheic exchange is important because water flux through the streambed influences microbial communities and water quality, but little is known about the way in which it changes over time, particularly in response to stream restoration. We used tracer tests and geophysical monitoring, along with streambed characterization, to examine the evolution of the hyporheic zone after construction of a stream restoration structure at Crabby Creek, an urbanized watershed in southeastern Pennsylvania. Changes were assessed by comparing data from 2009 and 2010 over a 13.5 m reach centered on a J-hook. The breakthrough curves from streambed well sampling were remarkably similar in 2009 and 2010, with steep rising and falling limbs indicating rapid exchange followed by a short period (less than 2 hours) of slightly elevated concentration before returning to background levels. The resistivity tomographs of the subsurface showed areas of lingering tracer after the injection stopped. Upstream of the J-hook, there was an area of lingering tracer that persisted for more than 3 hours after the injection stopped. This upstream region of slow exchange was similar for both years. Downstream of the structure, there was lingering tracer in 2009, but a smaller, less intense region in 2010. Streambed characterization showed that 20 cm of erosion occurred in the downstream section between the two years, along with an increased proportion of fines, which was associated with inhibited hyporheic flux. The resistivity profiles showed areas of lingering tracer and helped map changes in the hyporheic zone that were not apparent from well sampling alone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000300929400007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2BHydrogeophysics%2Bto%2BMonitor%2BChange%2Bin%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2Baround%2BStream%2BRestoration%2BStructures%26rft.aufirst%3DLaura%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DToran%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2113%252Fgseegeosci.18.1.83%26rft.epage%3D97%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1078-7275%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2B%2526%2BENGINEERING%2BGEOSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D83-97%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D83%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BENG%2BGEOSCI%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DToran%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DHughes%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DRyan%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+%26+ENGINEERING+GEOSCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"McKnight, DM",Jun 2004 ,Inorganic N and P dynamics of Antarctic glacial meltwater streams as controlled by hyporheic exchange and benthic autotrophic communities,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The McMurdo Dry Valleys of South Victoria Land, Antarctica, contain numerous glacial meltwater streams that drain into takes on the valley floors. Many of the streams have abundant perennial mats of filamentous cyanobacteria. The algal mats grow during streamflow in the austral summer and are in a dormant freeze-dried state during the rest of the year. NO3 and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations were lower in streams with abundant algal mats than in streams with sparse algal mats. NO3 and SRP concentrations were higher in the hyporheic zone of a stream with abundant algal mats than in the stream itself. An experimental injection of LiCl, NaNO3, and K3PO4 was conducted in Green Creek, which has abundant algal mats. Substantial hyporheic exchange occurred. The NO3 and PO4 concentrations at 50 m below the injection were 55 muM and 18 muM, respectively, during the experiment. NO3 and PO4 concentrations were below the detection limit of 1 to 2 muM at a site 497 m below the injection during the Cl tracer arrival, indicating a high capacity for nutrient uptake by algal communities. NO2 and NH4 were present at sites 226 and 327 m below the injection, indicating that, in addition to denitrification and algal uptake, dissimilatory NO3 reduction to NO2 and NH4 may be a NO3 sink during transport. Transport modelling with nutrient uptake represented as a 1(st)-order process yielded reach-scale parameters of 4.3 x 10(-5) to 3.9 x 10(-4)/s and 1.4 x 10(-4) to 3.8 x 10(-1)/s for uptake of NO3 and PO4, respectively. The best match with the observed data was a model in which PO4 uptake occurred only in the main channel and NO3 uptake occurred in the main channel and in the hyporheic zone. Hyporheic NO3 uptake was 7 to 16% of the total uptake for the different stream reaches. These results demonstrate that nutrient flux to the lakes is controlled by hyporheic exchange and nutrient uptake by algal mats in dry valley streams. Streams without algal mats contribute more nutrients to the lakes than streams with algal mats.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000221974000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInorganic%2BN%2Band%2BP%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2BAntarctic%2Bglacial%2Bmeltwater%2Bstreams%2Bas%2Bcontrolled%2Bby%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bbenthic%2Bautotrophic%2Bcommunities%26rft.aufirst%3DDM%26rft.auinit%3DDM%26rft.aulast%3DMcKnight%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F0887-3593%25282004%2529023%253C0171%253AINAPDO%253E2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D188%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D171-188%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D171%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DMcKnight%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DRunkel%252C%2BRL%26rft.au%3DMoorhead%252C%2BDL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

15,"Hassan, MA",Jan 30 2015 ,The effects of discharge and slope on hyporheic flow in step-pool morphologies,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"This paper focuses on surface-subsurface water exchange in a steep coarse-bedded stream with a step-pool morphology. We use both flume experiments and numerical modelling to investigate the influence of stream discharge, channel slope and sediment hydraulic conductivity on hyporheic exchange. The model step-pool reach, whose topography is scaled from a natural river, consists of three step-pool units with 0.1-m step heights, discharges ranging between base and over-bankfull flows (scaled values of 0.3-4.5 l/s) and slopes of 4% and 8%. Results indicate that the deepest hyporheic flow occurs with the steeper slope and at moderate discharges and that downwelling fluxes at the base of steps are highest at the largest stream discharges. In contrast to findings in a pool-rifflemorphology, those in this study show that steep slopes cause deeper surface-subsurface exchanges than gentle slopes. Numerical simulation results show that the portion of the hyporheic zone influenced by surface water temperature increases with sediment hydraulic conductivity. These experiments and numerical simulations emphasize the importance of topography, sediment permeability and roughness elements along the channel surface in governing the locations and magnitude of downwelling fluxes and hyporheic exchange. Our results show that hyporheic zones in these steep streams are thicker than previously expected by extending the results from streams with pool-riffle bed forms.

16,"Movahedi, N",Mar 2021 ,Hyporheic exchanges due to channel bed and width undulations,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Riffle-pool sequences are fundamental, ubiquitous morphological features of alluvial rivers that are thoroughly studied in general and commonly incorporated into river restoration projects. Most previous investigations on the effect of riffle-pool sequences on hyporheic exchanges focused on solely bed undulation, because that is widely thought to be the defining feature of riffle-pool sequences. However, riffle- pool sequences also have significant width undulations that are vital to riffle-pool sequences morphodynamics, yet relatively few studies exist on the effect of such undulations on hyporheic exchanges. Thus, in this study based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, we investigate the effect of bed and width undulations on hyporheic zone characteristics for various ratio of width amplitude to bed amplitude. The variation of hyporheic exchange characteristics (i.e. hyporheic exchange flux and residence time) for different riffle-pool designs were also assessed by creating prescribed topography of synthetic river valleys. The results showed that due to pressure variation along width undulations, the upwelling and downwelling patterns can also be observed for only width undulations in rivers, in the absence of bed undulations, and as width undulation amplitude decreases, the normalized hyporheic exchanges (Q(Hz)*) increase and normalized median residence time (RT*) decreases. Also, simultaneous channel bed and width undulations result in higher Q(Hz)* especially when a pool is located in an expansion (aka ""oversized"" cross-section) and a riffle in a constriction (""nozzle""). Our results suggest that river restoration project that artificially construct wide pools and constricted riffles will achieve maximum Q(Hz)* and RT*, though they will not be geomorphically self-sustainable.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000621604000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B103857%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchanges%2Bdue%2Bto%2Bchannel%2Bbed%2Band%2Bwidth%2Bundulations%26rft.aufirst%3DNeshat%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DMovahedi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2021.103857%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D149%26rft.au%3DMovahedi%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DDehghani%252C%2BAA%26rft.au%3DHalghi%252C%2BMM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"Febria, CM",May 2012 ,Bacterial community dynamics in the hyporheic zone of an intermittent stream,ISME JOURNAL,"The dynamics of in situ bacterial communities in the hyporheic zone of an intermittent stream were described in high spatiotemporal detail. We assessed community dynamics in stream sediments and interstitial pore water over a two-year period using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Here, we show that sediments remained saturated despite months of drought and limited hydrologic connectivity. The intermittency of stream surface water affected interstitial pore water communities more than hyporheic sediment communities. Seasonal changes in bacterial community composition was significantly associated with water intermittency, phosphate concentrations, temperature, nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. During periods of low- to no-surface water, communities changed from being rich in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in isolated surface pools, to a few OTUs overall, including an overall decline in both common and rare taxa. Individual OTUs were compared between porewater and sediments. A total of 19% of identified OTUs existed in both porewater and sediment samples, suggesting that bacteria use hyporheic sediments as a type of refuge from dessication, transported through hydrologically connected pore spaces. Stream intermittency impacted bacterial diversity on rapid timescales (that is, within days), below-ground and in the hyporheic zone. Owing to the coupling of intermittent streams to the surrounding watershed, we stress the importance of understanding connectivity at the pore scale, consequences for below-ground and above-ground biodiversity and nutrient processing, and across both short- and long-time periods (that is, days to months to years).

18,"Calfe, ML",Feb 2022 ,Nitrate removal by watershed-scale hyporheic stream restoration: Modeling approach to estimate effects and patterns at the stream network scale,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Excess nutrient pollution and eutrophication are widespread, and stream restoration is increasingly implemented as a solution. Yet few studies evaluate the cumulative effects of multiple individual restoration projects on watershed-scale nutrient loading. We developed a new modeling approach linking the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) to an auxiliary R script that simulates hyporheic exchange. We used the modeling approach to simulate hyporheic enhancement by in-stream restoration features (e.g., structures, pool-riffles, gravel bars) implemented throughout a generic 4th-order gaining watershed in the eastern USA. We assumed groundwater was widely impacted by nitrate, thus the primary pollutant source was baseflow gaining. Model results indicated that hyporheic restoration throughout all streams of our 4th-order watershed would reduce nitrate loading to downstream waterbodies by -83%. This percentage assumes removal of all nitrate that enters the hyporheic zone and is for a gravel/sand bed, so reductions would be smaller with finer sediments or incomplete removal. For example, when we reduced the hyporheic exchange rate by an order of magnitude, the maximum watershed nitrate load reduction decreased to -25%. The relationship between the percent of watershed stream channels that have been restored and percent nitrate load reduction at the watershed outlet was nonlinear. This relationship was exponential in smaller streams (1st- and 2nd-order) due to efficient removal of all incoming nitrate, but became linear in larger streams (3rd- and 4th-order) due to ""recycling"" of channel flow through the hyporheic zone more than once. Yet restoration was more effective at overall nitrate load reduction in larger (e.g., 3rd-4th order) streams because the majority of nitrate enters the watershed through groundwater gaining in those larger streams. Thus, the location of restoration projects within a watershed is important in determining their effect on nitrate loads at the watershed outlet. Overall, our results indicate hyporheic restoration can significantly reduce watershed nitrate loading to downstream waterbodies, yet watersheds must be viewed as a whole to understand the potential impacts of any particular project under consideration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000728757700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B106498%26rft.atitle%3DNitrate%2Bremoval%2Bby%2Bwatershed-scale%2Bhyporheic%2Bstream%2Brestoration%253A%2BModeling%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Bestimate%2Beffects%2Band%2Bpatterns%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%2Bscale%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DML%26rft.aulast%3DCalfe%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecoleng.2021.106498%26rft.eissn%3D1872-6992%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0925-8574%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D175%26rft.au%3DCalfe%252C%2BML%26rft.au%3DScott%252C%2BDT%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Hester, ET",Aug 2014 ,Variation of Hyporheic Potential among Urban Region Streams: Implications for Stream Restoration,ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE,"Bidirectional (hyporheic) exchange of water between stream channels and sediments benefits stream ecosystems, yet the effects of urbanization on such exchange are poorly understood. Exchange is controlled by a set of geomorphic parameters collectively defined as ""hyporheic potential,"" including sediment hydraulic conductivity (K), vertical undulations of the streambed (VC), and channel sinuosity (S). We measured these hyporheic potential metrics in 10 stream reaches with varying percent impervious surface (0-47 percent) in their contributing watersheds. We performed linear regression between hyporheic potential metrics and two metrics of urbanization: percent impervious in the watershed and average riparian forest buffer width. We found that most trends between hyporheic potential metrics and both urbanization metrics were noisy, with low r(2). Furthermore, hyporheic potential varied as much among our streams as in non-urban studies, and K varied as much within stream reaches as between stream reaches. These results collectively indicate that the effects of urbanization on hyporheic potential in our streams were minimal and that urbanization may not heavily constrain hyporheic exchange. Nevertheless, we did find that S increased with impervious cover in the contributing watershed, consistent with higher urban storm flows leading to sinuosity adjustments to reduce channel slope. Urbanization may therefore enhance hyporheic potential under certain circumstances, and bears further study. Furthermore, there may be value in increasing the benefits of hyporheic exchange above existing levels through ""hyporheic enhancement."" Because K varied more among streams than VC, which varied more than S, efforts to enhance hyporheic exchange may have greatest effect if they manipulate K.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000344364100005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariation%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BPotential%2Bamong%2BUrban%2BRegion%2BStreams%253A%2BImplications%2Bfor%2BStream%2BRestoration%26rft.aufirst%3DErich%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2113%252Fgseegeosci.20.3.287%26rft.eissn%3D1558-9161%26rft.epage%3D304%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1078-7275%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2B%2526%2BENGINEERING%2BGEOSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D287-304%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D287%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BENG%2BGEOSCI%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DCranmer%252C%2BEN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+%26+ENGINEERING+GEOSCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Song, JX",Mar 2019 ,Estimating spatial pattern of hyporheic water exchange in slack water pool,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,"Hyporheic zone (HZ) influences hydraulic and biogeochemical processes in and alongside streams, therefore, investigating the controlling geographic factors is beneficial for understanding the hydrological processes in HZ. Slack water pool (SWP) is an essential micro-topographic structure that has an impact on surface water and groundwater interactions in the HZ during and after high flows. However, only a few studies investigate HZ surface water and groundwater exchange in the SWP. This study used the thermal method to estimate the HZ water exchange in the SWP in a segment of the Weihe River in China during the winter season. The findings show that on the flow-direction parallel to the stream, river recharge dominates the HZ water exchange, while on the opposing flow-direction bank groundwater discharge dominates the water exchange. The water exchange in the opposing flow-direction bank is about 1.6 times of that in the flow-direction bank. The HZ water exchange is not only controlled by flow velocity but also the location and shape of the SWP. Great water exchange amount corresponds to the shape with more deformation. The maximum water exchange within the SWP is close to the river bank where the edge is relatively high. This study provides some guidelines for water resources management during flooding events.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000458216900005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEstimating%2Bspatial%2Bpattern%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bslack%2Bwater%2Bpool%26rft.aufirst%3DJinxi%26rft.auinit%3DJX%26rft.aulast%3DSong%2BJinxi%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11442-019-1604-3%26rft.eissn%3D1861-9568%26rft.epage%3D388%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1009-637X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOGRAPHICAL%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D377-388%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D377%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOGR%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BDD%26rft.au%3DShen%252C%2BWB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOGRAPHICAL+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The impact of threedimensional and small-scale bed form topographies on hyporheic exchange and solute mixing is investigated in the present work. The effect of bed form morphologies on the development of zones of enhanced reaction rates (i. e., hotspots) is also studied. A computational fluid dynamics model to simulate river flow over bed forms is combined with a subsurface flow and multicomponent reactive solute transport model. A wide variety of bed form topographies are generated using geometric models by varying parameters controlling curvature as well as bed form wavelength and amplitude. The results in this research suggest that out-of-phase bed forms generate more complex hyporheic flow patterns which reduce the efficiency of solute transformations. Higher phase shifts in bed form shapes result in overall higher average velocity, larger zones of enhanced pressure and reaction rates, and higher amounts of solute exchange. Moreover, the bed form shapes control the reaction process for a wide range of sediment conductivities. This study advances the understanding of the effects of complex and small scale morphological features on hyporheic exchange processes including the rate and spatio-temporal distribution of reaction hotspots.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000701825000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B104025%26rft.atitle%3DBed%2Bform-induced%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bgeochemical%2Bhotspots%26rft.aufirst%3DFaranak%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DBehzadi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2021.104025%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D156%26rft.au%3DBehzadi%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DWallace%252C%2BCD%26rft.au%3DSoltanian%252C%2BMR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Schmadel, NM",Jul 2017 ,Hydrologic controls on hyporheic exchange in a headwater mountain stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The spatial and temporal scales of hyporheic exchange within the stream corridor are controlled by stream discharge and groundwater inflow interacting with streambed morphology. While decades of study have resulted in a clear understanding of how morphologic form controls hyporheic exchange at the feature scale, we lack comparable predictive power related to stream discharge and the spatial structure of groundwater inflows at the reach scale, where spatial heterogeneity in both geomorphic setting and hydrologic forcing are present. In this study, we simulated vertical hyporheic exchange along a 600 m mountain stream reach under high, medium, and low stream discharge while considering groundwater inflow as negligible, spatially uniform, or proportional to upslope accumulated area. Most changes to hyporheic flow path residence time or length in response to stream discharge were small (<5%), suggesting that discharge is a secondary control relative to morphologically driven hyporheic exchange. Groundwater inflow was a primary control and mostly caused decreases in hyporheic flow path residence time and length. This finding generally agrees with expectations from the literature; however, flow path response was not consistent across the study reach. Instead, we found that flow paths driven by large hydraulic gradients coinciding with large morphologic features were less sensitive to changes in groundwater inflow than those driven by hydraulic gradients similar to the valley gradient. Our results indicate that consideration of heterogeneous arrangement of morphologic features is necessary to differentiate between hyporheic flow paths that persist in time and those that are sensitive to changing hydrologic conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000407895000058,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bcontrols%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bmountain%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DNoah%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DNM%26rft.aulast%3DSchmadel%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR020576%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6278%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6260-6278%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6260%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DSchmadel%252C%2BNM%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of discharge on hyporheic water quality in a regulated Swedish boreal river during a 10-day experimental period with a sequence of alternating high- and low-flow episodes. A 250 m reach was instrumented with 28 piezometers placed at 150 and 300 turn below the river bed or below the mean groundwater level in the floodplain, and these piezometers were used to measure temperature, oxygen, electric conductivity and pH. High daily variation in air temperature during the first 3 days was transmitted vertically through the stream water into the hyporheic zone within hours. An oxygen saturation of 100% in the river water corresponded to 60-70% saturation at 150 mm depth and 30% at 300 mm depth. The hyporheic oxygen concentration at 150 mm depth decreased during the experimental period, falling into a range that is potentially harmful to incubating salmonid eggs. This was interpreted as a long-term response to the overall regulation regime, rather than a response to short-term water regulation during the experiment. Even though the effect of short-term regulation on the quality of hyporheic water in the river bed was limited, there was a more pronounced effect on the quality of floodplain hyporheic water. Most of the driving forces for temporal variation of water quality in the river bed came vertically from the river water, rather than from the lateral exchange.

Vegetation, which is ubiquitous in nature, is known to impact hyporheic exchange; yet how vegetation impacts hyporheic exchange remains to be characterized. Here, we show that at the same spatially and temporally-averaged flow velocity U $U$, vegetation increases the rate of hyporheic exchange by a factor of four. By tracking the movement of fluorescent dye in a flume with the refractive-index-matched sediment and translucent vegetation dowels, we demonstrate that the vegetation-induced hyporheic exchange can be characterized by an effective hyporheic exchange velocity, VH ${V}_{H}$. We further demonstrate that VH ${V}_{H}$ correlates with the total near-bed turbulent kinetic energy kt ${k}_{t}$ rather than U $U$, when kt<6x10-4m2/s2 ${k}_{t}< 6\times {10}<^>{-4}\,{\mathrm{m}}<^>{2}/{\mathrm{s}}<^>{2}$, indicating that turbulent kinetic energy is a better metric than flow velocity for predicting hyporheic exchange in regions with vegetation.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000822729900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2022GL099095%26rft.atitle%3DImpacts%2Bof%2BEmergent%2BVegetation%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DHuang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2022GL099095%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BJQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
25,"Siergieiev, D",Nov 15 2014 ,Flow regulation effects on the hydrogeochemistry of the hyporheic zone in boreal rivers,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"River-aquifer interfaces are essential for ecosystem functioning in terms of nutrient exchange and biological habitat, but are greatly threatened world-wide. This study examined geochemical aspects of river-aquifer interaction in one regulated and one unregulated boreal river in Northern Sweden to determine whether the geochemical functioning of the hyporheic zone is affected by hydrological alterations, e.g. regulated river discharge and river-aquifer connectivity. In the unregulated Kalix River, the hyporheic pore water was well-oxygenated with orthogonal fluxes (approximate to 0.6-0.7 m d(-1)) and acted as a sink for Fe, Mn, Al, NH4, and Ca, with fractional losses of 95%, 92%, 45%, 31%, and 15%, respectively. A corresponding elevation in the concentrations of these elements in the hyporheic sediment was observed, with higher saturation indices of Fe-, Mn-, and Al-bearing secondary minerals in hyporheic waters. In the regulated Lule River, hydraulic connectivity at the river-aquifer interface was altered by the presence of a clogging layer (0.04 m d(-1)). In addition, the river discharge oscillated daily, severely reducing exchange flows across the riverbed (<0.01 m d(-1)). As a result, the hyporheic pore water was suboxic, with elevated concentrations of filtered Fe and Mn (fractional increases of approximate to 3700% and approximate to 2500%, respectively) and other solutes (NH4, Si, S, Ca). A conceptual model revealed functional differences between geochemical features of the hyporheic zone of regulated and unregulated rivers. Overall, the results showed that hyporheic processes are altered along regulated rivers, with resulting impacts on the geochemistry of riverine, riparian and related marine ecosystems.

26,"Storey, RG",Jul 2004 ,Nitrogen processing in the hyporheic zone of a pastoral stream,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"The distribution of nitrogen-transforming processes, and factors controlling their rates, were determined within the hyporheic zone of a lowland stream draining agricultural land. In the field, physicochemical parameters were measured along a 10 m-long hyporheic flow line between downwelling and upwelling zones. Sediment cores were retrieved from the stream bed surface, and from 20, 40 and 60 cm deep in each zone, and in the laboratory, water from the corresponding depth was percolated through each core at the natural flow rate. Concentrations of nitrogen species and oxygen were measured before and after flow through each core. Denitrification was measured using a N-15-nitrate tracer. Shallow and downwelling zone samples were clearly distinct from deeper and upwelling zone samples in terms of physicochemical conditions, microbial processes and factors controlling nitrogen processing. Denitrification was highest in surface and downwelling zone cores, despite high oxygen levels, probably due to high pore-water nitrate concentrations in these cores and isolation of the denitrifying bacteria from oxygen in the bulk water by the hyporheic biofilms. Denitrification was limited by oxygen inhibition in the downwelling group, and by nitrate availability in the upwelling group. Strong evidence indicated that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, occurred in almost all cores, and outcompeted denitrification for nitrate. In contrast, nitrification was undetectable in all but two cores, probably because of intense competition for oxygen. Field patterns and lab experiments indicated that the hyporheic zone at this moderately N-rich site is a strong sink for nitrate, fitting current theories that predict where hyporheic zones are nitrate sinks or nitrate sources.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000221930000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNitrogen%2Bprocessing%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bpastoral%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DRG%26rft.auinit%3DRG%26rft.aulast%3DStorey%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FB%253ABIOG.0000031049.95805.ec%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D313%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D285-313%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D285%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D69%26rft.au%3DStorey%252C%2BRG%26rft.au%3DWilliams%252C%2BDD%26rft.au%3DFulthorpe%252C%2BRR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"Clilverd, HM",Mar 2008 ,Nitrogen retention in the hyporheic zone of a glacial river in interior Alaska,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"We examined the hydrologic controls on nitrogen biogeochemistry in the hyporheic zone of the Tanana River, a glacially-fed river, in interior Alaska. We measured hyporheic solute concentrations, gas partial pressures, water table height, and flow rates along subsurface flowpaths on two islands for three summers. Denitrification was quantified using an in situ (NO3-)-N-15 push-pull technique. Hyporheic water level responded rapidly to change in river stage, with the sites flooding periodically in mid-July to early-August. Nitrate concentration was nearly 3-fold greater in river (ca. 100 mu g NO3--N l(-1)) than hyporheic water (ca. 38 mu g NO3--N l(-1)), but approximately 60-80% of river nitrate was removed during the first 50 m of hyporheic flowpath. Denitrification during high river stage ranged from 1.9 to 29.4 mg N kg sediment(-1) day(-1). Hotspots of methane partial pressure, averaging 50,000 ppmv, occurred in densely vegetated sites in conjunction with mean oxygen concentration below 0.5 mgO(2) l(-1). Hyporheic flow was an important mechanism of nitrogen supply to microbes and plant roots, transporting on average 0.41 gNO(3)(-) -N m(-2) day(-1), 0.22 gNH(4)(+) -N m(-2) day(-1), and 3.6 g DON m(-2) day(-1) through surface sediment (top 2 m). Our results suggest that denitrification can be a major sink for river nitrate in boreal forest floodplain soils, particularly at the river-sediment interface. The stability of the river hydrograph and the resulting duration of soil saturation are key factors regulating the redox environment and anaerobic metabolism in the hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000256263600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNitrogen%2Bretention%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bglacial%2Briver%2Bin%2Binterior%2BAlaska%26rft.aufirst%3DHannah%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DHM%26rft.aulast%3DClilverd%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-008-9192-9%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D46%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D31-46%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D31%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D88%26rft.au%3DClilverd%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DJones%252C%2BJB%26rft.au%3DKielland%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
28,"Marmonier, P",Apr 2010 ,Hyporheic flowpaths and interstitial invertebrates associated with stable and eroded river sections: interactions between micro- and meso-scales,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Erosion of the river beds linked to human activities is currently a crucial issue. By inducing strong changes in river dynamics, this erosion alters many of the related ecological processes. The modification of the relationships between the river and its aquifer due to erosion is not really understood. The large scale consequences of erosion for the interactions between river and the underlying aquifer must be clarified, together with the small scale effects of river erosion on hyporheic flowpaths. The role of water exchange within the hyporheic zone on the distribution of interstitial invertebrates is universally recognized, but nothing is known on the potential links between riverbed erosion, the subsequent modification of water exchange at a local scale and their consequences on the distribution and biomass of hyporheic invertebrates.Two sections, stable versus eroded, were studied on the Herbasse, a third-order stream, by sampling hyporheic water and invertebrates at two depths within the substrate (-15 and -50 cm deep), upstream and downstream of ten riffles. Seven physical and chemical parameters were used to identify the hydrological flowpaths at both the riffle (up and downwelling areas) and the section scales (eroded vs stable) and to specify the level of nutrients in the hyporheic habitat.Significant differences were observed between the stable and eroded sections both in the vertical and longitudinal dimensions, with for example available oxygen decreasing with depth and along hyporheic flowpaths, and revealing more obvious differences in the eroded section gaining groundwater than in the stable section. Most of the hypogean organisms (Niphargus sp., Salentinella juberthiei, and Proasellus sp.) were most abundant at the deepest level, in the upwelling zones and the eroded section, while typical epigean taxa (Gammarus sp., Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera) were mostly present near the surface and in the stable section, suggesting that erosion processes may influence the development of hyporheic assemblages at riffle and reach scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000281759300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bflowpaths%2Band%2Binterstitial%2Binvertebrates%2Bassociated%2Bwith%2Bstable%2Band%2Beroded%2Briver%2Bsections%253A%2Binteractions%2Bbetween%2Bmicro-%2Band%2Bmeso-scales%26rft.aufirst%3DPierre%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DMarmonier%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F1863-9135%252F2010%252F0176-0303%26rft.epage%3D317%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D303-317%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D303%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D176%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DLuczyszyn%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DDole-Olivier%252C%2BMJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
29,"Drummond, JD",Oct 13 2020 ,Significance of Hyporheic Exchange for Predicting Microplastic Fate in Rivers,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS,"Microplastics are abundantly found in streambed sediments, including both small and low-density particles of neutral and positive buoyancy. Although the flow of water into streambed sediments (hyporheic exchange) has previously been shown to increase the rate of delivery of fine particles to the streambed, the influence of hyporheic exchange on microplastic fate in aquatic environments has not yet been assessed in detail. Here we evaluate the effects of hyporheic exchange on microplastics by calculating and comparing the rates of delivery of microplastics to streambed sediments by hyporheic exchange and gravitational settling for combinations of particle size and density most commonly found in streams. In a field stream study, we found that 23% of all microplastic combinations have a hyporheic exchange rate that is higher than their settling rate. This fraction was as high as 42% for microplastics composed of low-density polymers, such as polyethylene. We then expand these findings to consider a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions in rivers and demonstrate that hyporheic exchange is important for the transport and fate of particles that are <100 mu m in diameter, irrespective of polymer type. Models that do not include hyporheic exchange are therefore likely to substantially underestimate the deposition, retention, and long-term accumulation of microplastics in streambed sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000580957000006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSignificance%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bfor%2BPredicting%2BMicroplastic%2BFate%2Bin%2BRivers%26rft.aufirst%3DJennifer%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DDrummond%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.estlett.0c00595%26rft.epage%3D732%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2328-8930%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D727-732%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D727%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECH%2BLET%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DNel%252C%2BHA%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
30,"Fernald, AG",Dec 2006 ,"Water quality changes in hyporheic flow paths between a large gravel bed river and off-channel alcoves in Oregon, USA",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Changes in water quality that occur as water flows along hyporheic flow paths may have important effects on surface water quality and aquatic habitat, yet very few studies have examined these hyporheic processes along large gravel bed rivers. To determine water quality changes associated with hyporheic flow along the Willamette River, Oregon, we studied hyporheic flow at six-bar deposit sites positioned between the main river channel and connected lentic alcoves. We installed piezometers and wells at each site and measured water levels and water quality in river, hyporheic and alcove water. Piezometric surfaces along with substrate characteristics were used to determine hyporheic flow path direction and hyporheic flow rate. At all sites, hyporheic flow moved from the river through bar deposits into alcove surface water. Stable isotope analysis showed little influence of upwelling groundwater. At a majority of sites, hyporheic dissolved oxygen and ammonium decreased relative to river water, and hyporheic specific conductance, nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorous increased relative to river water. At three sites, hyporheic temperature decreased 3-7 degrees C relative to river water; there was less temperature change at the other three sites. At the two sites with the highest hyporheic flow rates, hyporheic cooling was propagated into the alcove surface water. Hyporheic changes had the greatest effect on alcove water quality at sites with highly permeable substrates and high-hyporheic flow rates. The best approach to enhancing hyporheic flows and associated water quality functions is through restoring fluviogeomorphic channel processes that create and maintain high-permeability gravel deposits conducive to hyporheic flow.

31,"Kaser, DH",Feb 15 2014 ,Prospective modelling of 3D hyporheic exchange based on high-resolution topography and stream elevation,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"River managers and scientists interested in hyporheic processes need adequate tools for characterizing hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) at local sites where only poor information on subsurface properties are available. This study evaluates a three-dimensional modelling approach, on the basis of detailed surface parameterization and a simplified subsurface structure, for comparison of potential HEF characteristics at three experimental reaches at the channel-unit scale. First, calibration is conducted to determine the best fit-of-heads given the model simplification, then the structure of residuals are used to evaluate the origin of the misfit, and finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify inter-site differences in HEF. Results show that such an approach can highlight potential magnitude differences in HEF characteristics between reaches. The sensitivity analysis is successful in delineating the small area of exchange that remains under conditions of high groundwater discharge. In this case, however, the calibrated model performs poorly in representing the exchange pattern at the sediment-water interface, thus suggesting that the approach is less adequate for a deterministic simulation of observed heads. The summary statistics are in the range of similar published models, for which the reported indicator is the root mean square error on heads normalized by the head drop over the reach. We recommend, however, that modellers use a more comparable indicator, such as a measure of the residuals normalized by a measure of observed vertical head differences. Overall, when subsurface data are unavailable or sparse, a three-dimensional groundwater model based on high-resolution topographic data combined with a sensitivity analysis appears as a useful tool for a preliminary characterization of HEF.

32,"Kazezyilmaz-Alhan, CM",Sep 30 2006 ,Stream solute transport incorporating hyporheic zone processes,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The behavior of solute transport in pool and riffle, or meandering types of streams, is greatly influenced by surface/subsurface flow and solute transport interactions. It is important to model these processes accurately in rivers and streams to improve downstream water quality. Two decades ago, Bencala and Walters (1983) [Bencala, K. E., Walters, R.A., 1983, Simulation of solute transport in a mountain pool-and-riffle stream - a transient storage model. Water Resources Research 19(3), 718-724] introduced the transient storage model to represent the movement of solute from main streams into stagnant zones and back to the main stream. This model includes the effect of both surface storage, in which water is stationary relative to the main channel and the hyporheic zone, to which water moves from the main channel, flows through and returns to the main channel. However, their simplified approach lumped the surface storage and hyporheic zones together in a single storage zone. In this study, we take a step towards a mechanistic model to explain the physics of water exchange between the surface water and the porous media by developing an improved mathematical model. For this purpose, we include the advection and dispersion processes into the transient storage zone, and we consider the hyporheic zone as a transient porous media from surface water to ground water. We use this improved model to solve a test problem in order to demonstrate its capabilities. Finally, we simulate the Uvas Creek experiment and compare our results to the observations described in Bencala and Walters (1983) [Bencala, K.E., Walters, R.A., 1983, Simulation of solute transport in a mountain pool-and-riffle stream - a transient storage model.

Exchanges of water, nutrients, and organic matter occur in response to variations in discharge and bed topography and porosity. Upwelling subsurface water supplies stream organisms with nutrients while downwelling stream water provides dissolved oxygen and organic matter to microbes and invertebrates in the hyporheic zone. Dynamic gradients exist at all scales and vary temporally. At the microscale, gradients in redox potential control chemical and microbially mediated nutrient transformations occurring on particle surfaces. At the stream-reach scale, hydrological exchange and water residence time are reflected in gradients in hyporheic faunal composition, uptake of dissolved organic carbon, and nitrification. The hyporheic corridor concept describes gradients at the catchment scale, extending to alluvial aquifers kilometers from the main channel. Across all scales, the functional significance of the hyporheic zone relates to its activity and connection with the surface stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000077648200003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bfunctional%2Bsignificance%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1146%252Fannurev.ecolsys.29.1.59%26rft.epage%3D81%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0066-4162%26rft.jtitle%3DANNUAL%2BREVIEW%2BOF%2BECOLOGY%2BAND%2BSYSTEMATICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D59-81%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D59%26rft.stitle%3DANNU%2BREV%2BECOL%2BSYST%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DFindlay%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DValett%252C%2BHM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ANNUAL+REVIEW+OF+ECOLOGY+AND+SYSTEMATICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

To investigate the stream-groundwater interaction mechanisms in the lateral hyporheic zone, this study examined Ma'an Creek in Chongqing during the dry season from December 2015 to April 2016. The water level, water temperature, pH and Cl- concentration in the hyporheic zone and groundwater were monitored in situ. The sediment permeability coefficient, stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and concentration of DOC were analyzed. The results show that the water level changes of hyporheic zone and the movement of hyporheic flow were influenced significantly by the permeability coefficient of sediment. The hyporheic flow approximately 10 cm from the stream bank was clearly affected by precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration. During the study period, the groundwater recharged the stream, and the impact of groundwater on the hyporheic flow gradually decreased with the flow path. The hyporheic flow approximately 30 cm from the stream bank was still mainly affected by groundwater. Approximately 10-30 cm from the stream bank, the mixing of groundwater with precipitation and stream water intensified. Due to the sediment properties, moisture accumulated approximately 10 cm from the stream bank and drained into the stream via hyporheic flow, with potential impacts on stream water quality.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000413691300009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMovement%2Bof%2Blateral%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bbetween%2Bstream%2Band%2Bgroundwater%26rft.aufirst%3DYu%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%2BYu%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11430-016-9103-9%26rft.eissn%3D1869-1897%26rft.epage%3D2040%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1674-7313%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENCE%2BCHINA-EARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2033-2040%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2033%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BCHINA%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D60%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DXie%252C%2BSY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=SCIENCE+CHINA-EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
35,"Wagenhoff, A",Oct 2 2014 ,Does large woody debris affect the hyporheic ecology of a small New Zealand pasture stream?,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"Rehabilitation of vertical hydrological exchange in small pasture streams is expected to improve hyporheic habitat, invertebrate life and ecosystem functioning, and may be achieved by adding large woody debris (LWD). This study investigated whether hyporheic improvement within 10 to 50 cm below streambed surface is evident around existing wood structures in a small New Zealand pasture stream in the Whatawhata area near Hamilton. Samples were taken around LWD and from areas where no wood was present in the pasture and from a control stream. At the pasture stream site, where the hyporheic zone was impacted by sedimentation and suffered from low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (on average 8.4, 4.3 and 2.4 mg L-1 at 10, 30 and 50 cm depth, respectively), LWD was not associated with a significant improvement in vertical hydrological exchange, hyporheic habitat quality or invertebrate richness. However, higher densities in hyporheic invertebrates were found where LWD was present (100 vs. 56 individuals per L of sediment), in particular Leptophlebiidae and Oligochaeta. Potential pumping effects of LWD may have been hampered by large-scale deep groundwater upwelling in this reach. We conclude that in pasture streams where sedimentation is a legacy of land clearance on unstable slopes and where low hyporheic DO concentrations prevail, wood addition may not be an effective rehabilitation tool.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000345004000004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDoes%2Blarge%2Bwoody%2Bdebris%2Baffect%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Becology%2Bof%2Ba%2Bsmall%2BNew%2BZealand%2Bpasture%2Bstream%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DWagenhoff%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F00288330.2014.924539%26rft.eissn%3D1175-8805%26rft.epage%3D559%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0028-8330%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DNEW%2BZEALAND%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D547-559%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D547%26rft.stitle%3DNEW%2BZEAL%2BJ%2BMAR%2BFRESH%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DWagenhoff%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DOlsen%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=NEW+ZEALAND+JOURNAL+OF+MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
36,"Fudyma, JD",Jan 18 2021 ,Coupled Biotic-Abiotic Processes Control Biogeochemical Cycling of Dissolved Organic Matter in the Columbia River Hyporheic Zone,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"A critical component of assessing the impacts of climate change on watershed ecosystems involves understanding the role that dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays in driving whole ecosystem metabolism. The hyporheic zone-a biogeochemical control point where ground water and river water mix-is characterized by high DOM turnover and microbial activity and is responsible for a large fraction of lotic respiration. Yet, the dynamic nature of this ecotone provides a challenging but important environment to parse out different DOM influences on watershed function and net carbon and nutrient fluxes. We used high-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to provide a detailed molecular characterization of DOM and its transformation pathways in the Columbia river watershed. Samples were collected from ground water (adjacent unconfined aquifer underlying the Hanford 300 Area), Columbia river water, and its hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone was sampled at five locations to capture spatial heterogeneity within the hyporheic zone. Our results revealed that abiotic transformation pathways (e.g., carboxylation), potentially driven by abiotic factors such as sunlight, in both the ground water and river water are likely influencing DOM availability to the hyporheic zone, which could then be coupled with biotic processes for enhanced microbial activity. The ground water profile revealed high rates of N and S transformations via abiotic reactions. The river profile showed enhanced abiotic photodegradation of lignin-like molecules that subsequently entered the hyporheic zone as low molecular weight, more degraded compounds. While the compounds in river water were in part bio-unavailable, some were further shown to increase rates of microbial respiration. Together, river water and ground water enhance microbial activity within the hyporheic zone, regardless of river stage, as shown by elevated putative amino-acid transformations and the abundance of amino-sugar and protein-like compounds. This enhanced microbial activity is further dependent on the composition of ground water and river water inputs. Our results further suggest that abiotic controls on DOM should be incorporated into predictive modeling for understanding watershed dynamics, especially as climate variability and land use could affect light exposure and changes to ground water essential elements, both shown to impact the Columbia river hyporheic zone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000659417400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B574692%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2BBiotic-Abiotic%2BProcesses%2BControl%2BBiogeochemical%2BCycling%2Bof%2BDissolved%2BOrganic%2BMatter%2Bin%2Bthe%2BColumbia%2BRiver%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DJane%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DFudyma%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2020.574692%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D2%26rft.au%3DFudyma%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DChu%252C%2BRK%26rft.au%3DTfaily%252C%2BMM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
37,"Kiel, BA",Jun 2014 ,Lateral hyporheic exchange throughout the Mississippi River network,NATURE GEOSCIENCE,"River water circulates vertically through the river bed and laterally through bank sediments(1-4). This hyporheic exchange brings river water into contact with microbes in the adjacent sediments, otherwise known as the hyporheic exchange zone. As such, hyporheic zones act as hotspots for the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, metals and nutrients in rivers(1,2,5-8), and can, for example, influence the export of nitrogen to downstream ecosystems(5,9,10). Here, we calculate the extent and duration of lateral hyporheic exchange throughout the Mississippi River network, using a physics-based numerical model that takes into account the distribution of groundwater baseflow, river discharge, alluvium permeability and river morphology(3,4). We find that in our simulations, lateral exchange occurs throughout the network: practically all of the river water that reaches the mouth of the Mississippi River network has circulated through the lateral hyporheic zone. River water residence time in the hyporheic zone ranges from less than an hour in headwaters to over a month in larger channels. Comparison of the residence times that we derive to a previously reported residence time threshold for denitrification suggests that around one quarter of the lateral hyporheic zones in the Mississippi River network favour denitrification, and thus nitrogen loss. Given that river water can circulate many times through the river bank before reaching the river mouth, and can undergo vertical exchange with the river bed, we suggest that our estimates serve as a lower limit for potential nitrogen loss.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000337164400011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLateral%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bthroughout%2Bthe%2BMississippi%2BRiver%2Bnetwork%26rft.aufirst%3DBrian%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DBA%26rft.aulast%3DKiel%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252FNGEO2157%26rft.eissn%3D1752-0908%26rft.epage%3D417%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1752-0894%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURE%2BGEOSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D413-417%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D413%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BGEOSCI%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DKiel%252C%2BBA%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=NATURE+GEOSCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

In this study, we conducted flume experiments (pool-riffle amplitude of 0.03 m and wavelengths of 0.5 m) and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations to quantify how restoration structures impacted hyporheic penetration depth, D-p, and hyporheic vertical discharge rate, Q(v). Restoration structures were channel-spanning vanes with subsurface footers placed in the gravel bed at each riffle. Hyporheic vertical discharge rate was estimated by analyzing solute concentration decay data, and maximum hyporheic penetration depth was measured as the interface between hyporheic water and groundwater using dye tracing experiments. The CFD was verified with literature-based flume hydraulic data and with D-p and Q(z) observations, and the CFD was then used to document how D-p and Q(z) varied with flume discharge, Q, ranging from 1 to 15 L/s (3E+03hyporheic zone. Q(z) had a positive linear relationship with Q, while D-p initially grew as Q increased, but then shrunk when a hydraulic jump with low streambed pressured formed downstream of the structure. The restoration structures created counter-acting forces of increased downwelling head due to backwater effects, and increased upwelling due to low streambed pressure and standing waves downstream of the structure.Key Points in-channel structures accelerate the hyporheic exchange rate in-channel structures reduce the hyporheic exchange zone higher flow rate induces greater hyporheic exchange rateShow less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000324838300036,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DReshaping%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bbeneath%2Briver%2Brestoration%2Bstructures%253A%2BFlume%2Band%2Bhydrodynamic%2Bexperiments%26rft.aufirst%3DTian%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DZhou%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20384%26rft.epage%3D5020%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5009-5020%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5009%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BTA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
39,"Sobczak, WV",Nov 2002 ,Variation in bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon among stream hyporheic flowpaths,ECOLOGY,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dominates the flux of organic matter in most stream ecosystems, but the proportion susceptible to microbial degradation is often presumed to be low. The fraction of bulk DOC contributing to microbial metabolism was assessed in five streams representing the regional range in surface-water DOC concentration in eastern New York State, USA (range 0.5-7.7 mg/L; n = 82). Transects of shallow wells along two hyporheic flowpaths (i.e., saturated sediments found below and lateral to the open-stream channel in active exchange with surface waters) in each of five streams were sampled monthly at baseflow to determine changes in subsurface DOC and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Hyporheic DOC concentrations ranged from 50% to 100% of surface-water concentrations and decreased along hyporheic flowpaths in four of five streams. Dissolved oxygen losses along hyporheic flowpaths paralleled DOC loss, and bacterial activity on tiles incubated at points along the flowpaths generally declined as hyporheic DOC was depleted. DOC losses along natural flowpaths exceeded the quantity of DOC lost during laboratory bottle incubations, even when samples were amended with inorganic nutrients. Hyporheic mesocosms were used to examine the fate of stream-derived DOC along replicated flowpaths under controlled hydrologic conditions. The overall patterns of DOC losses along mesocosm flowpaths supplied with water from previously studied. streams were similar to DOC losses along natural flowpaths. DOC declines were paralleled by declines in bacterial activity and dissolved oxygen. Mesocosm results indicated that variation in percentage of DOC loss along natural flowpaths was not a function of dilution, residence time, or initial DOC concentration and-that subsurface DOC dynamics were linked to variation in microbial metabolism.The fraction of total. DOC available for metabolism varied markedly among regional streams and was independent of initial DOC concentration. DOC near the end of hyporheic flowpaths was not subject to further degradation, regardless of the bioavailability of surface-water DOC entering these flowpaths. Hence, in streams with significant hyporheic exchange, the amount and bioavailability of DOC transported to downstream ecosystems may be affected by subsurface metabolism. DOC depletion during hyporheic transport may provide a general in situ measure of bioavailable DOC in surface water and be a powerful predictor of rates of heterotrophic activity in sediments at the reach level.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000179624600025,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariation%2Bin%2Bbioavailability%2Bof%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bamong%2Bstream%2Bhyporheic%2Bflowpaths%26rft.aufirst%3DWV%26rft.auinit%3DWV%26rft.aulast%3DSobczak%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F3071853%26rft.epage%3D3209%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-9658%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3194-3209%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3194%26rft.stitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D83%26rft.au%3DSobczak%252C%2BWV%26rft.au%3DFindlay%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
40,"BOULTON, AJ",1993 ,"STREAM ECOLOGY AND SURFACE HYPORHEIC HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE - IMPLICATIONS, TECHNIQUES AND LIMITATIONS",,"In many streams with coarse substrata, there is continuous exchange between surface water and interstitial (hyporheic) water. Upwelling hyporheic water usually contains less dissolved oxygen and may provide nutrients that are limiting in the surface water. Downwelling stream water carries oxygen, surface detritus and other material to the hyporheic zone where microbes and invertebrates reside. The magnitude and direction of this hydrologic exchange can be measured using relatively simple techniques (such as dye injections and mini-piezometers) although there are some important limitations to consider. As hydrologic exchange has been shown to affect the distribution of benthic algae and invertebrates in some streams, this variable has implications for a variety of lotic studies including those of drift, leaf breakdown, benthic invertebrate colonization, sedimentation, and nutrient limitation. Experiments in flumes and artificial stream channels usually remove the influence of hydrologic exchange although it would be possible to incorporate this into their design. Stream ecologists should consider assessing the significance of the hyporheic zone to surface processes by quantifying the vectors of hydrologic exchange to ascertain how these may affect results of work conducted on the benthos at a variety of scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1993MC46600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSTREAM%2BECOLOGY%2BAND%2BSURFACE%2BHYPORHEIC%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BEXCHANGE%2B-%2BIMPLICATIONS%252C%2BTECHNIQUES%2BAND%2BLIMITATIONS%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBOULTON%26rft.date%3D1993%26rft.epage%3D564%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0067-1940%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DAUSTRALIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D553-564%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D553%26rft.stitle%3DAUST%2BJ%2BMAR%2BFRESH%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D44&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=AUSTRALIAN+JOURNAL+OF+MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Ren, J",Aug 11 2020 ,Quantification of the temporal-spatial distributions characteristics of streambed hyporheic exchange fluxes with the seasonal variation using heat as a tracer,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Groundwater-surface water interaction, particularly on exchange fluxes between streams and aquifers, plays a large role in the prerequisite conditions for the study of contaminants and nutrients in the hyporheic zone. One way to quantify these fluxes is by using heat as an environmental tracer. This study quantitatively analyzes the spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty of the vertical turbulent flow of a canopy in the Walker River Basin in Nevada, USA, using the thermal tracer method and the VFLUX software tool. Using the high spatial resolution temperature data measured by the US Geological Survey in the Walker River Basin in Nevada, with the finite element software, COMSOL Multiphysics, it establishes a two-dimensional, full-transect, water-thermal coupling calculation model for the river. The results show that long-term vertical hyporheic flux is between - 111.78 and 86.07 L/m(2)/d. The average vertical hyporheic flux under seasonal conditions was - 44.35 L/m(2)/d and - 36.78 L/m(2)/d in summer and winter, respectively, and the flux exhibits a non-monotonic change with increasing depth. By observing the similarity between the spatial distribution of streambed hyporheic exchange fluxes in winter and summer, as well as the distribution of the streambed profile temperature field, it was found that the spatial distribution of the average streambed hyporheic exchange fluxes can be clearly shown by the streambed profile temperature field in the corresponding season.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000558788100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B385%26rft.atitle%3DQuantification%2Bof%2Bthe%2Btemporal-spatial%2Bdistributions%2Bcharacteristics%2Bof%2Bstreambed%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bfluxes%2Bwith%2Bthe%2Bseasonal%2Bvariation%2Busing%2Bheat%2Bas%2Ba%2Btracer%26rft.aufirst%3DJie%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-020-09128-7%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D16%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D79%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BYL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",Jan 1 2019 ,Do thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing and direct hyporheic measurements (DHM) similarly detect river-groundwater exchanges? Study along a 40 km-section of the Ain River (France),SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Water exchanges through the hyporheic zone are crucial to many ecological processes in streams. One major challenge for river managers is to find a practical method for localizing these exchanges using rapid data acquisition techniques. This work compares spatially continuous data, acquired by Thermal Infrared (TIR) techniques, with discrete data collected in surface water and in the hyporheic zone (DHM), at sites of expected water exchanges (gravel bars). Forty gravel bars, distributed along a 40 km-sector of the Ain River were sampled at upstream- and downstream-bar positions (80 sites) in order to reveal hyporheic exchanges. At each site, 4 physico-chemical parameters were measured at 0, -20 and -50 cm beneath the sediment surface. The field collections of TIR high-resolution images were conducted concomitantly, at low flow and high surface-water temperatures. Among the 80 sites selected for field measurements, 14 were identified as upwellings (groundwater inputs) and 66 as downwelling sites. From those 14 upwellings, 13 were also identified with TIR. The 44 additional sites identified with TIR corresponded to small-sized cold-water patches situated along the gravel bars or to groundwater discharge sites located between the bars (19 lateral seeps). Nevertheless, the DHM method documented on downwelling exchanges (infiltration of surface water), which were not captured by TIR images, and may represent hyporheic hotspots especially for benthic invertebrates. Along the studied sector of the Ain River, these downwelling zones were much more numerous than upwelling ones. Both methods in combination provide a rather complete picture of water exchange along rivers and are needed to evaluate the potential as refuges zones during critical dry periods.

43,"Gomez-Velez, JD",Sep 28 2014 ,A hydrogeomorphic river network model predicts where and why hyporheic exchange is important in large basins,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Hyporheic exchange has been hypothesized to have basin-scale consequences; however, predictions throughout river networks are limited by available geomorphic and hydrogeologic data and by models that can analyze and aggregate hyporheic exchange flows across large spatial scales. We developed a parsimonious but physically based model of hyporheic flow for application in large river basins: Networks with EXchange and Subsurface Storage (NEXSS). We applied NEXSS across a broad range of geomorphic diversity in river reaches and synthetic river networks. NEXSS demonstrates that vertical exchange beneath submerged bed forms rather than lateral exchange through meanders dominates hyporheic fluxes and turnover rates along river corridors. Per kilometer, low-order streams have a biogeochemical potential at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than higher-order streams. However, when biogeochemical potential is examined per average length of each stream order, low-and high-order streams were often found to be comparable. As a result, the hyporheic zone's intrinsic potential for biogeochemical transformations is comparable across different stream orders, but the greater river miles and larger total streambed area of lower order streams result in the highest cumulative impact from low-order streams. Lateral exchange through meander banks may be important in some cases but generally only in large rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000344913700013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bhydrogeomorphic%2Briver%2Bnetwork%2Bmodel%2Bpredicts%2Bwhere%2Band%2Bwhy%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bis%2Bimportant%2Bin%2Blarge%2Bbasins%26rft.aufirst%3DJesus%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DGomez-Velez%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014GL061099%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D6412%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D18%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6403-6412%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6403%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
44,"Chen, XB",Jun 2018 ,Hyporheic Exchange Driven by Three-Dimensional Sandy Bed Forms: Sensitivity to and Prediction from Bed Form Geometry,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bed form-driven hyporheic exchange is vital to biogeochemical processes occurring within aquatic sediment. The integrated effects of hyporheic processes in a bed form ultimately impact watershed-scale water quality. However, much of what is understood regarding bed hyporheic exchange is based on idealized two-dimensional bed forms despite the prevalence of potentially complex three-dimensional (3-D) bed forms in sandy riverbeds. We thus examined the impact of bed form three-dimensionality on hyporheic exchange. Bed form three-dimensionality was represented by two groups of geometric parameters: (1) crest planform curvature and (2) transverse and longitudinal wavelength and amplitude. A wide variety of synthetic bed forms was generated based on the geometric parameters. Then, surface flow over and hyporheic flow through each bed form was calculated using a 3-D multiphysics computational fluid dynamics model implemented across a range of Reynolds Number. We found that hyporheic exchange is sensitive to both types of parameters that determine the bed form three-dimensionality. Hyporheic exchange is dominated however by the three-dimensionality caused by out-of-phase superimposed sinusoidal surfaces. The results of the complex flow models were synthesized into simple equations for predicting hyporheic flux and bulk residence time based on bed form longitudinal and transverse wavelengths, bed form height, and Reynolds Number.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000440309900020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BExchange%2BDriven%2Bby%2BThree-Dimensional%2BSandy%2BBed%2BForms%253A%2BSensitivity%2Bto%2Band%2BPrediction%2Bfrom%2BBed%2BForm%2BGeometry%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaobing%26rft.auinit%3DXB%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR022663%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4149%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4131-4149%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4131%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXB%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The biofilm reacted with a quantitative increase after two weeks. The hyporheic invertebrates were sampled with the Cage Pipe Trap method, where the number of trapped animals is determined by the spatial density and the activity of the invertebrates. Within two and six weeks, the hyporheic invertebrates exhibited a reaction indicating an utilization of the new food resources. Over a longer period of one year, three different reaction patterns appeared. The number of nematods and ostracods increased extensively, presumably caused by the modification of the spatial structure of the environment due to biofilm growth. The number of the small sized invertebrates decreased, reflecting the reduced feeding effort. And the number of the large insect larvae increased indicating that these group is mainly limited by space.

We developed several models using different methods to estimate two of the most uncertain parameters - K and the depth and shape of the bedrock boundary. We first tested the goodness of fit of each model to the water levels observed in a network of wells and piezometers. Results showed that differences among models in predicted heads were quite small, whereas differences among estimated hyporheic fluxes varied by a factor of two. We then tested the model predictions of tracer arrival times to each well in the network during a stream-tracer injection. Comparison of simulated and observed travel times showed that increased model sophistication did not lead to improved model reliability, because travel time predictions from the homogeneous model were equal to, or better than, the predictions from the heterogeneous models. While general trends in solute breakthrough were correct in the models, K data from even 37 wells in a 15 m by 50 m model domain were insufficient to characterize detailed arrival times accurately. This suggests that geomorphic data may be sufficient to predict water fluxes through the subsurface and approximate travel times. However, for detailed analysis of solute transport pathways and breakthroughs, intensive sampling of the subsurface may be necessary.

47,"Fellows, CS",May 2001 ,Whole-stream metabolism in two montane streams: Contribution of the hyporheic zone,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"We used whole-stream and benthic chamber methods to measure rates of metabolism and determine the contribution of the hyporheic zone to ecosystem respiration (R) in two streams with differing surface-subsurface exchange characteristics, Rio Calaveras and Gallina Creek, New Mexico. We used the difference between whole-stream and benthic R to calculate the rate of hyporheic zone R and coupled this estimate to an independent measure of hyporheic sediment R to estimate the cross-sectional area of the hyporheic zone (A(H)) for two reaches from each stream. Conservative tracer injections and solute transport modeling were used to characterize surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange by determining values of the cross-sectional area of the transient storage zone (A(s)). The hyporheic zone contributed a substantial proportion of whole-stream R in all four study reaches, ranging from 40 to 93%. Whole stream R, hyporheic R, and percent contribution of hyporheic R all increased as transient storage increased, with whole-stream and hyporheic R exhibiting significant relationships with A(s). All three measures of respiration and values of A(H) were much greater for both reaches of the stream with greater surface-subsurface exchange. A(H) is valuable for cross-site comparisons because it accounts for differences in rates of both benthic and hyporheic sediment R and can be used to predict the importance of the hyporheic zone to other stream ecosystem processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000168511500006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWhole-stream%2Bmetabolism%2Bin%2Btwo%2Bmontane%2Bstreams%253A%2BContribution%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DCS%26rft.auinit%3DCS%26rft.aulast%3DFellows%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.2001.46.3.0523%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D531%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D523-531%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D523%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DFellows%252C%2BCS%26rft.au%3DValett%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DDahm%252C%2BCN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Rosenberry, DO",Feb 15 2012 ,In situ quantification of spatial and temporal variability of hyporheic exchange in static and mobile gravel-bed rivers,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Seepage meters modified for use in flowing water were used to directly measure rates of exchange between surface and subsurface water in a gravel- and cobble bed river in western Pennsylvania, USA (Allegheny River, Qmean = 190 m(3)/s) and a sand- and gravel-bed river in Colorado, USA (South Platte River, Qmean = 9.7 m(3)/s). Study reaches at the Allegheny River were located downstream from a dam. The bed was stable with moss, algae, and river grass present in many locations. Median seepage was + 0.28 m/d and seepage was highly variable among measurement locations. Upward and downward seepage greatly exceeded the median seepage rate, ranging from + 2.26 (upward) to - 3.76 (downward) m/d. At the South Platte River site, substantial local-scale bed topography as well as mobile bedforms resulted in spatial and temporal variability in seepage greatly in exceedence of the median groundwater discharge rate of 0.24 m/d. Both upward and downward seepage were recorded along every transect across the river with rates ranging from + 2.37 to - 3.40 m/d. Despite a stable bed, which commonly facilitates clogging by fine-grained or organic sediments, seepage rates at the Allegheny River were not reduced relative to those at the South Platte River. Seepage rate and direction depended primarily on measurement position relative to local- and meso-scale bed topography at both rivers. Hydraulic gradients were small at nearly all seepage-measurement locations and commonly were not a good indicator of seepage rate or direction. Therefore, measuring hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity at in-stream piezometers may be misleading if used to determine seepage flux across the sediment-water interface. Such a method assumes that flow between the well screen and sediment-water interface is vertical, which appears to be a poor assumption in coarse-grained hyporheic settings.

49,"Lu, CP",Jul 2018 ,Experimental study on hyporheic flow varied by the clay lens and stream flow,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Hyporheic exchange is one of the important physical processes that affect the flow condition of surface water-groundwater interaction zone, the restoration of water environment and the maintenance of ecological balance. The influence mechanism of clay lens on hyporheic exchange has not been well revealed by now. A two-dimensional sand tank was constructed to study the influence of low permeable clay lens on the hyporheic zone under different surface flow conditions. Experimental results showed that the influence of clay lens on the hyporheic zone was of direction dependent and influenced by the size and location of clay lens and stream flow. The influence of clay lens on hyporheic exchange is not only hindering, but also enhancement at certain conditions. With the increase of the depth of clay lens, the hyporheic flow affected by clay lens show three patterns: inhibition, enhancement, and stability. Moreover, these effects were gradually weakened with the increase of stream flow. Hyporheic flow around the clay lens was more sensitive while the surface flow is at a relative small rate. The increasing of the clay lens length weakened the infiltration of surface water and the upwelling of groundwater. The joint action of surface water and groundwater is one of the important control conditions, and that will affect the clay lens to change the hyporheic exchange significantly.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000436907200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B482%26rft.atitle%3DExperimental%2Bstudy%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bvaried%2Bby%2Bthe%2Bclay%2Blens%2Band%2Bstream%2Bflow%26rft.aufirst%3DChengpeng%26rft.auinit%3DCP%26rft.aulast%3DLu%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-018-7668-z%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D77%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BCP%26rft.au%3DZhuang%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BHM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Mc48gLKs3S9b9ZzM8jK&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
