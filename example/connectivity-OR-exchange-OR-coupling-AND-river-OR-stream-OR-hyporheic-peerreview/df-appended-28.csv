Riverine water levels at the site underwent significant fluctuations (similar to 0.3 m) which appeared to be mainly associated with fluctuations in the N-S component of wind rather than with discharge.The lagoon studied was connected by a channel to the river. The measured flow through the channel was almost always out and had an average rate over the 30 days of the study which was large enough to empty the lagoon in 9 days. It is hypothesized that the replenishment flow to the lagoon occurred as a seeping flow through the bank separating the lagoon from the river. Successful comparisons between measurements and computer simulations of river water level and of the flow through the channel confirmed that it was the wind stress acting on the surface that mediated variations in riverine water levels and the exchange between river and lagoon.Show less,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000071118300012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bwind%2Bon%2Bwater%2Blevels%2Band%2Blagoon-river%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bthe%2BRiver%2BMurray%252C%2BAustralia%26rft.aufirst%3DIT%26rft.auinit%3DIT%26rft.aulast%3DWebster%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FMF97027%26rft.epage%3D550%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1323-1650%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D541-550%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D541%26rft.stitle%3DMAR%2BFRESHWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DWebster%252C%2BIT%26rft.au%3DMaier%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DBurch%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1071/MF97027,,"LAKES,DYNAMICS,SEA",,"CSIRO, Ctr Environm Mech, GPO Box 821, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia"
1,1,"Madadi, S",Jan 2016 ,Photodegradation of 4-nitrophenol using an impinging streams photoreactor coupled with a membrane,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PROCESSING-PROCESS INTENSIFICATION,"In the present work, degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in a novel configuration of an axial radial impinging streams photoreactor coupled with a membrane microfiltration was proposed. The influences of initial 4-NP concentration, catalyst loading, slurry flow rate and pH were investigated as the most important operating parameters. Firstly, the performance of axial radial impinging streams photoreactor was evaluated in a batch recirculation mode and optimum conditions for pertinent parameters were determined. Complete decomposition of a 30 ppm batch solution of 4-NP was obtained within almost 180 min under optimal conditions and the decrease in COD and TOC were 71% and 62%, respectively. The experimental data of 4-NP degradation with an initial concentration in the range of 10-50 ppm accorded well with pseudo-first order model. Finally, the photoreactor was equipped with a membrane and applied in the continuous degradation of 4-NP. A combination of pH 4,2 g/LTiO2 and 2.24 L/min flow rate were determined to be the optimized conditions for degradation of 30 ppm 4-NP in the continuous membrane impinging streams photoreactor. In this reactor, an increased performance capability, a less membrane fouling, a higher permeate flow rate and subsequently a higher efficiency compared to conventional processes can be seen.

2,2,"Aliyu, A",2018 ,Interference-Aware Multipath Video Streaming in Vehicular Environments,IEEE ACCESS,"The multipath transmission is one of the suitable transmission methods for high data rate oriented communication such as video streaming Each video packets are split into smaller frames for parallel transmission via different paths. One path may interfere with another path due to these parallel transmissions. The multipath oriented interference is due to the route coupling which is one of the major challenges in vehicular traffic environments. The route coupling increases channel contention resulting in video packet collision. In this context, this paper proposes an Interference-aware Multipath Video Streaming (I-MVS) framework focusing on link and node disjoint optimal paths. Specifically, a multipath vehicular network model is derived. The model is utilized to develop interference-aware video streaming method considering angular driving statistics of vehicles. The quality of video streaming links is measured based on packet error rate considering non-circular transmission range oriented shadowing effects. Algorithms are developed as a complete operational I-MVS framework. The comparative performance evaluation attests the benefit of the proposed framework considering various video streaming related metrics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000445510500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInterference-Aware%2BMultipath%2BVideo%2BStreaming%2Bin%2BVehicular%2BEnvironments%26rft.aufirst%3DAhmed%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DAliyu%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1109%252FACCESS.2018.2854784%26rft.epage%3D47626%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-3536%26rft.jtitle%3DIEEE%2BACCESS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D47610-47626%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D47610%26rft.stitle%3DIEEE%2BACCESS%26rft.volume%3D6%26rft.au%3DAliyu%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DAbdullah%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DJoda%252C%2BUM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=IEEE+ACCESS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2854784,"Video streaming,multipath,vehicular network,interference,multimedia,Route coupling,VANETs","PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS,ROUTING PROTOCOL,TRANSMISSION,PATH,NETWORKS,COMMUNICATION,OPTIMIZATION,STRATEGY,SCHEME",,"Bauchi State Univ, Gadau, Nigeria"
3,3,"Yuan, GF",Aug 15 2014 ,Energy and water exchanges over a riparian Tamarix spp. stand in the lower Tarim River basin under a hyper-arid climate,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,"Determining the maintenance and control mechanisms of the energy and water exchanges over the desert riparian forest zone in the lower Tarim River of China could improve our understanding of land surface processes of the groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the hinterland area of the Eurasian continent under hyper-arid climate. Nearly three years of continuous measurements of meteorological factors, surface water and energy fluxes, soil water content, and groundwater table were carried out over a riparian Tamarix spp. stand in the lower Tarim River basin. Because of scarce precipitation and low air humidity, the diurnal and seasonal variations of most meteorological factors exhibited simple unimodal dynamics. However, the seasonal variation of latent heat exchange (LE) was distinctly related to plant phenology. The sensible heat exchange (H) exhibited reverse course with the LE seasonal course, which suggested seasonal variation of the H was controlled by the LE course. In the daytime, a good linear relationship existed between evapotranspiration (ET) and reference evapotranspiration. The yearly ET over the tamarisk stand was approximately 500 mmyear(-1), and the mean daily ET is about 3.85 mm d(-1) in a vibrant growing season. The groundwater table and the soil water content (SWC) near the groundwater table exhibited obvious seasonal and diurnal variations in the growing seasons but SWC in the shallow soil layer did not, suggesting the groundwater was the water source of the tamarisk. Our analysis indicated that under a hyper-arid climate, the energy and water exchanges over riparian tamarisk stands in the lower Tarim River basin showed certain features: (1) plant transpiration accounted for most of the surface ET, with soil evaporation weak and negligible; (2) the seasonal processes of surface energy and water exchanges were highly related with plant phenology; (3) the diurnal processes of ET resulted from the comprehensive effects of all atmospheric factors; and (4) ET depends on groundwater, rather than precipitation.

It is important to clarify the coordination relationship and interactive response mechanism between them for sustainable development construction of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The coupling coordination degree model and the panel vector autoregressive model (PVAR) were adopted to quantitatively examine the dynamic coordination and interactive response of the ecological environment and urban resilience in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2000 to 2019. Our study's results are the following: (1) The ecological environment index and urban resilience index have a generally positive trend of fluctuation and increase during the study period but show significant regional differentiation. (2) The coupling coordination degree of ecological environment and urban resilience in the Yangtze River Economic Belt increased steadily, forming a spatial distribution pattern of ""strong in the east and weak in the west"", with cities in the region mainly at the basic coordination level and generally lagging behind in development. (3) Both the ecological environment and urban resilience systems in the Yangtze River Economic Belt have significant self-reinforcing mechanisms, but the reinforcing effect is gradually decreasing, and the two positively promote each other, with urban resilience showing a more obvious promoting effect on the ecological environment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000866774300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B11988%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BCoordination%2Band%2BInteractive%2BResponse%2BAnalysis%2Bof%2BEcological%2BEnvironment%2Band%2BUrban%2BResilience%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%26rft.aufirst%3DMei%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DYang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph191911988%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DJiao%252C%2BMY%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BJY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/ijerph191911988,"ecological environment,urban resilience,coupling coordination,interactive response,the Yangtze River Economic Belt","CITIES,GROWTH",,"Chongqing Univ Technol, Sch Management, Chongqing 400054, Peoples R China"
5,5,"Winkel, G",Feb 2016 ,Demolishing Dikes: Multiple Streams and Policy Discourse Analysis,POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL,"The Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) is an influential theoretical framework for the analysis of policymaking processes, in particular agenda setting. It has inspired numerous empirical applications, which result in substantially different interpretations, for instance, of what exactly the streams encompass, how policy entrepreneurship is practiced, and how the coupling of distinct streams works. This article undertakes a systematic assessment of the MSF's core elements from the perspective of policy discourse analysis. Through an understanding of streams as discursive patterns, and policy discourses as (historical) couplings of the streams, a new and theoretically consistent interpretation of streams and likely connections between them is offered. One specific focus is on Kingdon's concept of policy entrepreneurship and how it relates to ideas of agency in discourse analysis. Drawing on the recently proposed Discursive Agency Approach, we discuss how concepts such as subject positions in discourses, agent subjectivization via the dialectic interplay of individual characteristics and structural forces, and discursive practices and strategies relate to and can possibly complement the MSF. Particular emphasis is given to the metaphors the MSF provides. In conclusion, the article demonstrates that a post-positivist perspective holds great potential for enriching the MSF theoretically and strengthening it analytically.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000369010300006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDemolishing%2BDikes%253A%2BMultiple%2BStreams%2Band%2BPolicy%2BDiscourse%2BAnalysis%26rft.aufirst%3DGeorg%26rft.auinit%3DG%26rft.aulast%3DWinkel%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fpsj.12136%26rft.eissn%3D1541-0072%26rft.epage%3D129%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0190-292X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DPOLICY%2BSTUDIES%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D108-129%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D108%26rft.stitle%3DPOLICY%2BSTUD%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DWinkel%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DLeipold%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=POLICY+STUDIES+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/psj.12136,"multiple streams framework,multiple streams approach,policy entrepreneurs,coupling,political strategies,discursive agency,interpretive policy analysis","DISCURSIVE INSTITUTIONALISM,CLIMATE-CHANGE,FOREST POLICY,IMPLEMENTATION,AMBIGUITY,FRAMEWORK,STATE,IDEAS,POWER",,"European Forest Inst, Res Programme Forest Soc, Joensuu, Finland"
6,6,"Mermillod-Blondin, F",Mar 2003 ,Influence of macroinvertebrates on physico-chemical and microbial processes in hyporheic sediments,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The objective of this study was to measure the effects of invertebrates on the physical characteristics and microbial processes in hyporheic sediments. We investigated the impacts of an assemblage of three taxa (asellids, chironomid larvae, and tubificid worms) on sediment distribution, water fluxes, sediment organic carbon, biofilm (attached bacteria) characteristics, and O-2, dissolved organic carbon NO3-, NO2-, and NH4+ concentrations in slow filtration sand-gravel columns. The results showed that invertebrates clearly modified the distribution of particles in the sediment column, probably because of the structures (tubes, macropores, and faecal pellets) produced by the three taxa in the sediment. Our assessment of water fluxes indicated that invertebrate activities led to an increase in the porosity of the sediment columns. In addition, aerobic (O-2 consumption) and anaerobic (denitrification and fermentative decomposition of organic matter) microbial processes occurring in the sediment were stimulated in the presence of invertebrates. Finally,, the present study demonstrates that invertebrates can act as ecosystem engineers in heterogeneous sediments that are under the influence of an advective flux of water. The solute residence time increased in columns containing the faunal assemblage. Micro-organisms used more dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the presence of invertebrates because invertebrate activities increased the contact between the biofilm and water. We conclude that engineering by invertebrates in natural conditions modifies characteristics of the hyporheic zone and thereby enhances both the porosity of the sediment and the solute transport across the benthic interface.

7,7,"Mehl, S",Apr 2010 ,Grid-size dependence of Cauchy boundary conditions used to simulate stream-aquifer interactions,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"This work examines the simulation of stream-aquifer interactions as grids are refined vertically and horizontally and suggests that traditional methods for calculating conductance can produce inappropriate values when the grid size is changed. Instead, different grid resolutions require different estimated values. Grid refinement strategies considered include global refinement of the entire model and local refinement of part of the stream. Three methods of calculating the conductance of the Cauchy boundary conditions are investigated. Single- and multi-layer models with narrow and wide streams produced stream leakages that differ by as much as 122% as the grid is refined. Similar results occur for globally and locally refined grids, but the latter required as little as one-quarter the computer execution time and memory and thus are useful for addressing some scale issues of stream-aquifer interactions. Results suggest that existing grid-size criteria for simulating stream-aquifer interactions are useful for one-layer models, but inadequate for three-dimensional models. The grid dependence of the conductance terms suggests that values for refined models using, for example, finite difference or finite-element methods, cannot be determined from previous coarse-grid models or field measurements. Our examples demonstrate the need for a method of obtaining conductances that can be translated to different grid resolutions and provide definitive test cases for investigating alternative conductance formulations.

This latter allows the measurement of streaming potential together with the electrical resistance of porous plugs. The conductivity of electrolyte inside plug (pore conductivity) is deduced from electrical resistance measurements and is used together with streaming potential to evaluate the zeta potential by accounting for the surface conduction phenomenon. It is shown that neglecting the surface conduction phenomenon leads to a substantial underestimation of the zeta potential. The coupled measurements of streaming potential and plug electrical resistance yield zeta potential values that are in very good agreement with those obtained by electrophoresis. The densification of the porous plug with increasing pressure increments is put in evidence by the decrease in measured streaming potentials. Electrical resistance measurements make it possible to account for the increase in surface conductivity resulting from the more compacted structure of the plug. By doing so, the calculated zeta potential is found to be virtually independent of the pressure difference involved in streaming potential experiments, whereas the negligence of surface conduction phenomenon leads to a decrease in the apparent zeta potential with increasing pressure level.

9,9,"Ye, S",Nov 2017 ,Scaling Dissolved Nutrient Removal in River Networks: A Comparative Modeling Investigation,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Along the river network, water, sediment, and nutrients are transported, cycled, and altered by coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes. Our current understanding of the rates and processes controlling the cycling and removal of dissolved inorganic nutrients in river networks is limited due to a lack of empirical measurements in large, (nonwadeable), rivers. The goal of this paper was to develop a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical process model to simulate nutrient uptake at the network scale during summer base flow conditions. The model was parameterized with literature values from headwater streams, and empirical measurements made in 15 rivers with varying hydrological, biological, and topographic characteristics, to simulate nutrient uptake at the network scale. We applied the coupled model to 15 catchments describing patterns in uptake for three different solutes to determine the role of rivers in network-scale nutrient cycling. Model simulation results, constrained by empirical data, suggested that rivers contributed proportionally more to nutrient removal than headwater streams given the fraction of their length represented in a network. In addition, variability of nutrient removal patterns among catchments was varied among solutes, and as expected, was influenced by nutrient concentration and discharge. Net ammonium uptake was not significantly correlated with any environmental descriptor. In contrast, net daily nitrate removal was linked to suspended chlorophyll a (an indicator of primary producers) and land use characteristics. Finally, suspended sediment characteristics and agricultural land use were correlated with net daily removal of soluble reactive phosphorus, likely reflecting abiotic sorption dynamics. Rivers are understudied relative to streams, and our model suggests that rivers can contribute more to network-scale nutrient removal than would be expected based upon their representative fraction of network channel length.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000418736700053,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DScaling%2BDissolved%2BNutrient%2BRemoval%2Bin%2BRiver%2BNetworks%253A%2BA%2BComparative%2BModeling%2BInvestigation%26rft.aufirst%3DSheng%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DYe%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR020858%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D9641%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D9623-9641%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D9623%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DYe%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DReisinger%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DSivapalan%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017WR020858,"nutrient uptake,rivers,hydrology,biogeochemistry,network modeling,field experiments,scale effects","GULF-OF-MEXICO,STREAM ECOSYSTEMS,NITROGEN EXPORT,PHOSPHORUS,WATER,RETENTION,DELIVERY,DENITRIFICATION,TRANSPORT,EXCHANGE",,"Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Champaign, IL 61820 USA"

Several studies have recommended coupling 1D and 2D models for flood modelling as they provide sufficient descriptive information of floodplains with greater computational efficiency. This study aims to couple a 1D hydrological model (HEC-HMS) with a 2D hydraulic model (iRIC) to simulate flooding in the Nilwala river basin. Hourly rainfall and streamflow data of three flood events were used for calibration and validation of HEC-HMS. The model performed exceptionally well considering the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, percent bias, and root mean square error. The flood event of May 2017 was simulated on iRIC using the streamflow hydrographs modelled by HEC-HMS. An overall accuracy of 81.5% was attained when the simulated extent was compared with the surveyed flood extent. The accuracy of the simulated flood depth was assessed using the observed water level at Tudawa gauging station, which yielded an NSE of 0.94, PBIAS of -4.28, RMSE of 0.18 and R-2 of 0.95. Thus, the coupled model provided an accurate estimate of the flood extent and depth and can be further developed for hydrological flood forecasting on a regional scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000827793900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B17%26rft.atitle%3DTowards%2BCoupling%2Bof%2B1D%2Band%2B2D%2BModels%2Bfor%2BFlood%2BSimulation-A%2BCase%2BStudy%2Bof%2BNilwala%2BRiver%2BBasin%252C%2BSri%2BLanka%26rft.aufirst%3DLanthika%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DDhanapala%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fhydrology9020017%26rft.eissn%3D2306-5338%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROLOGY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DDhanapala%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DGunarathna%252C%2BMHJP%26rft.au%3DMeegastenna%252C%2BTJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/hydrology9020017,"Nilwala river basin,coupled flood modelling,HEC-HMS,iRIC","HEC-HMS MODEL,INUNDATION,RAINFALL",,"Rajarata Univ Sri Lanka, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Engn & Soil Sci, Anuradhapura 50000, Sri Lanka"
11,11,"Fellows, CS",Aug 2006 ,Coupling nutrient uptake and energy flow in headwater streams,ECOSYSTEMS,"Nutrient cycling and energy flow in ecosystems are tightly linked through the metabolic processes of organisms. Greater uptake of inorganic nutrients is expected to be associated with higher rates of metabolism [gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R)], due to assimilatory demand of both autotrophs and heterotrophs. However, relationships between uptake and metabolism should vary with the relative contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of organic matter. To investigate the relationship between metabolism and nutrient uptake, we used whole-stream and benthic chamber methods to measure rates of nitratenitrogen (NO3-N) uptake and metabolism in four headwater streams chosen to span a range of light availability and therefore differing rates of GPP and contributions of autochthonous carbon. We coupled whole-stream metabolism with measures of NO3-N uptake conducted repeatedly over the same stream reach during both day arid night, as well as incubating benthic sediments under both light and dark conditions. NO3-N uptake was generally greater in daylight compared to dark conditions, and although day-night differences in whole-stream uptake were not significant, light-dark differences in benthic chambers were significant at three of the four sites. Estimates of N demand indicated that assimilation by photoautotrophs could account for the majority of NO3-N uptake at the two sites with relatively open canopies. Contrary to expectations, photoautotrophs contributed substantially to NO3-N uptake even at the two closed-canopy sites, which had low values of GPP/R and relied heavily on allochthonous carbon to fuel R.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000240832800009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bnutrient%2Buptake%2Band%2Benergy%2Bflow%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DCS%26rft.aulast%3DFellows%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10021-006-0005-5%26rft.epage%3D804%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1432-9840%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D788-804%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D788%26rft.stitle%3DECOSYSTEMS%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DFellows%252C%2BCS%26rft.au%3DValett%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DThomas%252C%2BSA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=ECOSYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10021-006-0005-5,"metabolism,nitrogen,carbon,primary production,respiration,autotroph,heterotroph,autochthonous,allochthonous","OXYGEN CHANGE TECHNIQUE,ORGANIC-CARBON,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,FOREST STREAM,HETEROTROPHIC METABOLISM,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,PHOSPHORUS UPTAKE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,NITRATE UPTAKE,DESERT STREAM",,"Griffith Univ, Fac Environm Sci, Ctr Riverine Landscapes, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia"

Through intensive monitoring using a combination of hydrochemical and biological analyses of the riparian GW and SW in the Liuxi River basin, China, the spatial-temporal patterns and extent of GW-SW interactions were qualitatively and quantitatively identified. The similarity of dynamic changes in the river water and GW levels reflected the hydrological connectivity between the river water and riparian GW. The discontinuity of the concentration in the majority of water chemistry parameters delineated the GW-SW interaction chemical boundaries as being within a distance of 2 and 0.5 m from the river in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The GW in the GW-SW interaction zone was characterized as having lower levels of dissolved oxygen and nitrate, moderate levels of electrical conductivity and major ions, and higher total organic carbon values. The percentage of river water in riparian GW increased with the proximity to the river from 9.0 to 68.8% in the wet season (WS) to 6.0-23.1% in the dry season (DS). The extent of GW-SW interactions was quantitatively identified by the chloride mass balance to be within 2 and 0.5 m from the river in the WS and DS, respectively. Based on the one-dimensional numerical particle tracking method, the exchange width of river water and GW was calculated to be 0.52 m in the DS as well. The analyses of microbial data demonstrated that GW samples within a distance of 2 m in the WS and 0.5 m in the DS exhibited a unique microbial community structure that contained a mixture of microbial components in the river water and background GW, indicative of the GW-SW mixing. The GW-SW interaction microbial boundaries were consistent with the chemical boundaries in both seasons. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of an integrated approach combining hydrochemical data and microbial community structure for the determination of GW-SW interactions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000527388300051,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124622%26rft.atitle%3DIntegrating%2Bhydrochemical%2Band%2Bbiological%2Bapproaches%2Bto%2Binvestigate%2Bthe%2Bsurface%2Bwater%2Band%2Bgroundwater%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bthe%2BLiuxi%2BRiver%2Bbasin%252C%2Bsouthern%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DAiping%26rft.auinit%3DAP%26rft.aulast%3DZhu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.124622%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D583%26rft.au%3DZhu%252C%2BAP%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BZG%26rft.au%3DCao%252C%2BLX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124622,"Groundwater-surface water interactions,Microbial communities,Principal coordinates analysis,Liuxi River","HYDROLOGICAL EXCHANGE,BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES,MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES,WASTE-WATER,DYNAMICS,STREAM,TRANSFORMATION,PATTERNS,NUTRIENT,DENITRIFICATION",,"Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, 135 Xingang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China"

14,14,"Scotch, CG",May 10 2021 ,"Time-series temperature analyses indicate conduction and diffusion are dominant heat-transfer processes in fine sediment, low-flow streams",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Stream-groundwater exchange has been investigated in a wide range of hydrologic settings, though very few studies have focused on line-sediment streambeds. Well-established thermal methods (i.e., analytical and numerical solution of time-series temperature depth-profiles) in combination with Darcy's and electrical resistivity (ER) evaluations were implemented to improve understanding of processes dominating flow and transport in a low permeability and low-flow coastal stream such as Oso Creek, Texas. The seasonal-trend decomposition using Loess (STL) is tested as a potential means to differentiate between advection and conduction and is validated against groundwater fluxes derived from the other well-established thermal methods. The numerical and analytical solutions indicate groundwater upward discharge was 9 mm d(-1) for summer and 3.5 mm d(-1) for winter, corresponding to the region's extreme drought conditions. These types of low flow conditions are usually accompanied by hyporheic flow, limiting the vertical flow assumption. While the numerical and analytical methods provide good insight into streambed hydrology for a low-permeability and low-flow stream in a semiarid coastal area, there are limitations associated with the STL method.

The temperature and concentration of major ions in interstitial water differed very little from those of river water. DO concentrations in interstitial waters were 5.7 +/- 2.2 mg O(2)/l and 3.5 +/- 1.8 mg O(2)/l at the side and dried-up channels, respectively. Concentrations of ammonium and nitrite of both interstitial waters at the side (0.50 +/- 0.17 mu M and 0.13 +/- 0.09 mu M, NH4(+) and NO(2)(-)) and dried-up channels (0.90 +/- 2.14 mu M and 0.27 +/- 0.37 mu M) were lower than those of river water (1.7 +/- 0.8 mu M and 0.73 +/- 0.22 mu M), whereas nitrate (85 +/- 25 mu M at the side channel and 79 +/- 36 mu M at the dried-up channel) did not differ on average from those of river water (70 +/- 12 mu M), though they were often very low (< 10 % of those of river water) at shallow depths of the vegetated areas in the dried-up channel. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in interstitial waters at the dried-up channel (0.84 +/- 0.53 mu M) were lower than those at the side channel (1.9 +/- 0.5 mu M) and those of river water (1.5 +/- 0.5 mu M), and decreased downstream. These results suggest that this aerobic hyporheic zone can serve as a sink for ammonium, nitrite and SRP and to a lesser extent of nitrate. Concentrations of these nutrients in pool water varied greatly but did not differ on average from those of river water. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and SRP concentrations were negatively related to the algal biomass. Pool waters also had lower DIN concentrations at the vegetated areas and higher SPR concentrations at the bar head. These results suggest that nutrient concentrations in pool waters are controlled in a complex manner by algal assimilation and surface-subsurface water exchange. Therefore some pools may serve as a sink and others as a source for nutrients.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000238968900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDistribution%2Bof%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bcompounds%2Bin%2Binterstitial%2Band%2Bsurface%2Bstanding%2Bwater%2Bbodies%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bgravel%2Bbar%2Bof%2Bthe%2BKizu%2BRiver%252C%2BJapan%26rft.aufirst%3DKaori%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DAnbutsu%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F0003-9136%252F2006%252F0166-0145%26rft.epage%3D167%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D145-167%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D145%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D166%26rft.au%3DAnbutsu%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DNakajima%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DMitamura%252C%2BO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0166-0145,"hyporheic zone,gravel bar,isolated pool,nitrogen,phosphorus","DESERT STREAM ECOSYSTEM,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,HYPORHEIC ZONE,NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,INORGANIC NITROGEN,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,RIPARIAN,RETENTION",,"Univ Shiga Prefecture, Sch Environm Sci, Limnol Lab, 3165 Hassaka Cho, Shiga 5220057, Japan"

The case of variable heat capacity of streams is considered. Distributions of heat exchange coefficients and heat capacity rates of the streams for which this minimum of irreversibility can be achieved are found. The problem is solved for a wide class of heat transfer kinetic laws in which the heat flow is proportional to the contact surface. The possibility of evaporation and condensation of streams is investigated. The concept of thermodynamic equivalence of dual-stream and multi-stream systems is introduced and the conditions that lead to such equivalence are obtained. Using this equivalence for Newtonian kinetics, optimal synthesis conditions are obtained for dualstream and multi-stream systems with a given total heat transfer coefficient and heat load. It is shown how the solution can be implemented in a system of dual-stream heat exchangers. (c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

17,17,"Ward, AS",Apr 2022 ,Advancing river corridor science beyond disciplinary boundaries with an inductive approach to catalyse hypothesis generation,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"A unified conceptual framework for river corridors requires synthesis of diverse site-, method- and discipline-specific findings. The river research community has developed a substantial body of observations and process-specific interpretations, but we are still lacking a comprehensive model to distill this knowledge into fundamental transferable concepts. We confront the challenge of how a discipline classically organized around the deductive model of systematically collecting of site-, scale-, and mechanism-specific observations begins the process of synthesis. Machine learning is particularly well-suited to inductive generation of hypotheses. In this study, we prototype an inductive approach to holistic synthesis of river corridor observations, using support vector machine regression to identify potential couplings or feedbacks that would not necessarily arise from classical approaches. This approach generated 672 relationships linking a suite of 157 variables each measured at 62 locations in a fifth order river network. Eighty four percent of these relationships have not been previously investigated, and representing potential (hypothetical) process connections. We document relationships consistent with current understanding including hydrologic exchange processes, microbial ecology, and the River Continuum Concept, supporting that the approach can identify meaningful relationships in the data. Moreover, we highlight examples of two novel research questions that stem from interpretation of inductively-generated relationships. This study demonstrates the implementation of machine learning to sieve complex data sets and identify a small set of candidate relationships that warrant further study, including data types not commonly measured together. This structured approach complements traditional modes of inquiry, which are often limited by disciplinary perspectives and favour the careful pursuit of parsimony. Finally, we emphasize that this approach should be viewed as a complement to, rather than in place of, more traditional, deductive approaches to scientific discovery.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000776511900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14540%26rft.atitle%3DAdvancing%2Briver%2Bcorridor%2Bscience%2Bbeyond%2Bdisciplinary%2Bboundaries%2Bwith%2Ban%2Binductive%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Bcatalyse%2Bhypothesis%2Bgeneration%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14540%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14540,"inductive,machine learning,river corridor,scientific method,stream corridor","SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER,ECOENZYMATIC STOICHIOMETRY,HYPORHEIC TRANSPORT,ENVIRONMENT-SELECTS,STREAM,NITROGEN,NETWORK,FLOW,FRAMEWORK,MOUNTAIN",,"Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 418 MSB II, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA"
18,18,"Arseneault, D",Jul 2007 ,Asynchronous forest-stream coupling in a fire-prone boreal landscape: insights from woody debris,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"1. We used dendrochronology to reconstruct the transfer of coarse woody debris across a forest-stream interface in a fire-prone boreal landscape. A sequence of regulating factors was considered from source to sink of in-stream woody debris (SWD), including fire history at the landscape scale, patterns of post-fire recovery of riparian forest and inputs of SWD at the scale of a stream reach and its associated floodplain, and burial of SWD at an excavated site.2. Fires occurred repeatedly in the studied landscape (at least in 1708, 1733, 1791, 1811, c. 1838, c. 1850, 1882, 1941 and 1998), and were generally patchy on the floodplain because of the firebreak effect of the riparian corridor. Unburned forest remnants were regularly generated at the stream margin, thus permitting temporally continuous but spatially localized transfer of woody material across the forest-stream interface. These remaining forest patches also increased forest resilience by dispersing seeds and promoting conifer re-establishment in burned areas.3. Because of higher severity compared with previous fires, the 1941 fire burned almost everywhere on the floodplain, creating only a few widely isolated unburned forest remnants. Consequently, following an abrupt post-fire increase, SWD inputs almost completely ceased. In addition, post-fire recovery of the riparian wood source is slow because of the spatially restricted seed source.4. In this alluvial stream, wood burial is faster than decay and largely determines the residence time of SWD. Because the residence time is about 150 years, the current density of SWD is high and contrasts sharply with the very low tree density at the stream margin. Although this long residence time helps maintain stream integrity while the forest is recovering from the 1941 fire, it is unlikely that SWD inputs would resume extensively before burial of the current SWD pool.5. Our research exemplifies the potentially complex impacts of disturbances on material transfer between a source and a sink ecosystem. We conclude that when certain components of ecosystems are coupled by unidirectional flow, those components will behave asynchronously if a disturbance impact at the source ecosystem does not propagate rapidly to the sink and the source and the sink recover at different rates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000247320100021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAsynchronous%2Bforest-stream%2Bcoupling%2Bin%2Ba%2Bfire-prone%2Bboreal%2Blandscape%253A%2Binsights%2Bfrom%2Bwoody%2Bdebris%26rft.aufirst%3DDominique%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DArseneault%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2745.2007.01251.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2745%26rft.epage%3D801%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-0477%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D789-801%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D789%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D95%26rft.au%3DArseneault%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DBoucher%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DBouchon%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01251.x,"aquatic woody debris,boreal landscape,disturbance severity,ecosystem coupling,ecosystem resilience,forest-stream interface,lateral flow,nonlinear ecosystem dynamics,riparian forest,source-sink dynamics","NORTHERN QUEBEC,DYNAMICS,REGENERATION,RECRUITMENT,DISTURBANCE,VEGETATION,WOODLANDS,RECOVERY,ECOLOGY,HISTORY",,"Univ Quebec, Ctr Etud Nord, 300 Allee Ursulines, Rimouski, PQ G5L 3A1, Canada"
19,19,"Chen, KW",May 2022 ,Using Ensemble Data Assimilation to Estimate Transient Hydrologic Exchange Flow Under Highly Dynamic Flow Conditions,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Quantifying dynamic hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs) within river corridors that experience high-frequency flow variations caused by dam regulations is important for understanding the biogeochemical processes at the river water and groundwater interfaces. Heat has been widely used as a tracer to infer steady-state flow velocities through analytical solutions of heat transport defined by the diurnal temperature signals. Under sub-daily dynamic flow conditions, however, such analytical solutions are not applicable due to the violation of their fundamental assumptions. In this study, we developed a data assimilation-based approach to estimate the sub-daily flux under highly dynamic flow conditions using multi-depth temperature observations at a 5-min resolution. If the hydraulic gradient is measured, Darcy's law was used to calculate the flux with permeability estimated from temperature responses below the riverbed. Otherwise, flux was estimated directly by assimilating multi-depth temperature data at 1- or 2-hr time intervals assuming one-dimensional flow and heat transport governing equation. By comparing estimated fluxes with model-generated synthetic truth, we demonstrated that both schemes have robust performance in estimating fluxes under highly dynamic flow conditions. This data assimilation-based flux estimation method was able to capture the vertical sub-daily fluxes using multi-depth high-resolution temperature data alone, even in the presence of multi-dimensional flow. This approach has been successfully applied to real field temperature data collected at the Hanford site, which experiences highly dynamic HEFs. Our study shows the promise of adopting distributed 1-D temperature monitoring to capture spatial and temporal exchange dynamics in river corridors at a watershed scale or beyond.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000788309800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030735%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2BEnsemble%2BData%2BAssimilation%2Bto%2BEstimate%2BTransient%2BHydrologic%2BExchange%2BFlow%2BUnder%2BHighly%2BDynamic%2BFlow%2BConditions%26rft.aufirst%3DKewei%26rft.auinit%3DKW%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030735%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BKW%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DZachara%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR030735,"hydrologic exchange flow,data assimilation,hyporheic zone,heat tracer","DIURNAL TEMPERATURE SIGNALS,THERMAL-DIFFUSIVITY,TIME-SERIES,WATER FLUX,RIVER STAGE,SURFACE,HEAT,TRANSPORT,STREAM,SEDIMENTS",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA"
20,20,"Zhang, WB",Mar 2020 ,Modeling and comparative analysis of a flow and heat coupling model of the riparian zone based on thermal conductivity empirical models,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Recently, the use of heat as a tracer to evaluate the process of hyporheic exchange in riparian zones has attracted wide attention. A more accurate flow-heat coupling model of riparian zones could help us understand the patterns of water flow and heat transfer in riparian zones and provide a scientific basis for the comprehensive management and efficient utilization of these zones. In this paper, a flow-heat coupling model of a riparian zone based on thermal conductivity empirical models (TCEMs) was built by customizing partial differential equations (PDEs) based on the simulation of soil water flow using porous media and the subsurface flow module in COMSOL. Combined with the data collected from the field heat tracer test in the riparian zone, the flow-heat coupling model of the riparian zone under 12 types of TCEMs was validated and compared. The results show that the use of the PDE module instead of the heat transfer in porous media (HTPM) module is very effective for modeling; the PDE module could basically replace the HTPM module in the heat transfer calculation. The performance of the flow-heat coupling model varies under different types of TCEMs, and the Chung and Horton (1987) model shows better simulation effects, with a root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean relative error (MRE) ranging from L37 to 2.48 degrees C, 0.73-0.94, 1.06-2.08 degrees C, and 11.94-15.79%, respectively. Therefore, this model could better reflect the dynamic temperature variations in the riparian zone. The sensitivity analysis results illustrate that the hydraulic conductivity (K-s), van Genuchten parameter (beta), volumetric heat capacity of dry solids (C-s), and porosity (n) of the flow-heat coupling model greatly influence riparian zone temperature variations, and the parameters beta, K-s, and residual water content (theta(r)) significantly affect the lateral hyporheic exchange rate in the riparian zone, of which beta has the largest effect.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000517663700069,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124539%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Band%2Bcomparative%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Ba%2Bflow%2Band%2Bheat%2Bcoupling%2Bmodel%2Bof%2Bthe%2Briparian%2Bzone%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bthermal%2Bconductivity%2Bempirical%2Bmodels%26rft.aufirst%3DWenbing%26rft.auinit%3DWB%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2019.124539%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D582%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BWB%26rft.au%3DShen%252C%2BZZ%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BCL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124539,"Riparian zone,Flow-heat coupling model,Thermal conductivity empirical models,COMSOL","CLOSED-FORM EQUATION,WATER-CONTENT,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,HYDRAULIC HEADS,TEMPERATURE,RIVER,SYSTEM,SIMULATION,TEXTURE",,"Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Peoples R China"

The linearity hypothesis was confirmed for data from 596 U. S. Geological Survey stream gaging stations in the eastern and central United States. For approximately 15% ( 89 of 596, NSC greater than or equal to 0.90) of stream gaging stations, weekly equilibrium temperature was a good estimator of weekly stream temperature with zero wind sheltering and sun shading. With sheltering and shading the number rose to 26% ( 156 of 596). For these streams the heat exchange through the water surface has the most controlling effect on stream temperatures. For the remaining 74% of streams the relationship between weekly stream temperature and weekly equilibrium temperature was also linear, but its slope was significantly less than 1.0 ( even after calibration for shading and sheltering), indicating that processes other than surface heat exchange have an influence. Cold water inflows were dominant for 8% ( 46 of 596) of stream gaging sites. Less than 5% of all stream gaging stations showed evidence of unnatural heat inputs. Fitting an equilibrium temperature linearly to recorded stream temperatures, e. g., at a weekly timescale, can be of use to project stream temperatures under different weather-climate scenarios or to identify both natural and anthropogenic heat and hydrologic inputs to streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000185480000003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1245%26rft.atitle%3DStream%2Btemperature-equilibrium%2Btemperature%2Brelationship%26rft.aufirst%3DT%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DBogan%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2003WR002034%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DBogan%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DMohseni%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DStefan%252C%2BHG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2003WR002034,"streams,water temperature,equilibrium temperature,air/water interface,reservoir effects,groundwater effects","WATER TEMPERATURES,UNITED-STATES,RIVER",,"Univ Minnesota, Dept Civil Engn, St Anthony Falls Lab, Mississippi River & 3rd Ave SE, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA"

The factors considered were heat exchanges at the water/atmosphere interface and groundwater inputs. The selected study area was the Loire River basin (110000km(2)), which displays contrasted meteorological, hydrological and geomorphological features. To capture the intra-basin variability of relevant physical factors driving the hydrological and thermal response of the system, the modelling approach combined a semi-distributed hydrological model, simulating the daily discharge at the outlet of 68 subwatersheds (drainage area between 100 and 3700km(2)), and a thermal model, simulating the average daily water temperature for each Strahler order in each subwatershed. Simulations at 67 measurement stations revealed a median root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.9 degrees C in summer between 2000 and 2006. Water temperature at stations located more than 100km from their headwater was adequately simulated (median RMSE<1.5 degrees C; -0.5 degrees Ccoupling subwatershed and Strahler order for temperature simulations is less time-consuming and has proven to be extremely consistent for large rivers, where the addition of streambed inputs is adequate to describe the effect of groundwater inputs on their thermal regime.

23,23,"Giannone, F",Oct 24 2020 ,Orchestrating heterogeneous MEC-based applications for connected vehicles,COMPUTER NETWORKS,"In the near future, 5G-connected vehicles will be able to exchange messages with each other, with the roadside infrastructure, with back-end servers, and with the Internet. They will do so with reduced latency, increased relia-bility, and large throughput under high mobility and user density. Different services with different requirements, such as Advanced Driving Assistance (ADA) and High Definition (HD) Video Streaming, will share the same physical resources, such as the wireless channel. Thus, a rigid orchestration among them becomes necessary to prioritize network resource allocation. This study proposes a Connected Vehicle Service Orchestrator (CVSO) which optimizes the Quality of Experience (QoE) of an in-vehicle infotainment video delivery service, while taking into account the required bandwidth for coexisting high priority services, such as ADA. To this end, we pro-vide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the problem of optimally assigning a video streaming bitrate/quality per user to maximize the overall QoE, considering information from the video service and the Ra-dio Access Network (RAN) levels. Our system takes advantage of recent developments in the area of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). In particular, we have implemented the CVSO and other service-level components and have deployed them on top of a standards-compliant MEC platform that we have developed. We exploit MEC-native services such as the Radio Network Information Service (RNIS) to offer the CVSO the necessary level of RAN awareness. Experiments on a full LTE network testbed featuring our MEC platform demonstrate the perfor-mance improvements our system brings in terms of video QoE. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate different algorithms to solve the ILP, which exhibit different trade-offs between solution quality and execution time.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000571740900015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B107402%26rft.atitle%3DOrchestrating%2Bheterogeneous%2BMEC-based%2Bapplications%2Bfor%2Bconnected%2Bvehicles%26rft.aufirst%3DFrancesco%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DGiannone%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.comnet.2020.107402%26rft.eissn%3D1872-7069%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1389-1286%26rft.jtitle%3DCOMPUTER%2BNETWORKS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DCOMPUT%2BNETW%26rft.volume%3D180%26rft.au%3DGiannone%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DFrangoudis%252C%2BPA%26rft.au%3DValcarenghi%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=COMPUTER+NETWORKS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107402,"Multi-access edge computing,4G/5G systems,Connected vehicles,Video streaming,Quality of experience","MOBILE,DELIVERY",,"TU Wien, Distributed Syst Grp, Vienna, Austria"
24,24,"Bourke, SA",Nov 27 2014 ,Carbon-14 in streams as a tracer of discharging groundwater,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Quantification of the volume of groundwater discharge to streams, and the source aquifer of that discharge, is required to adequately manage the impacts of groundwater use on stream ecosystems. This has been achieved through longitudinal surveys of gaseous tracers, but their effectiveness can be limited by rapid equilibration between the stream and the atmosphere. Here we develop the use of carbon-14 in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in a stream as a tracer of groundwater discharge. A controlled equilibration experiment was conducted, during which groundwater with an initial C-14 activity of 5.5 pMC was allowed to equilibrate with the atmosphere over 72 days. The effective transfer velocity for C-14 was measured as 0.013 m d(-1). The method was then tested at an artificial groundwater discharge location, where the effective transfer velocity was measured as 0.025 m d(-1). In these simple systems, the ratio of the effective C-14 transfer velocity to the CO2 gas transfer velocity is a function of pH, and proportional to the fraction of DIC present as CO2. The method was then applied along a reach of the Daly River, Australia, where groundwater discharge is known to occur. A decrease of 7 pMC was observed across the major spring discharge zone, with subsequent equilibration with the atmosphere occurring over at least tens of kilometres. This allowed for the effective transfer velocity to be estimated at between 0.09 and 0.15 m d(-1), and for the C-14 activity of groundwater discharge to be estimated at between 60 and 66 pMC. The equilibration of C-14 in stream DIC is in the order of 10 times slower than for gas tracers, which may allow for the detection of smaller groundwater discharge fluxes than is possible with gas tracers. If the total groundwater discharge flux is known, measurements of C-14 in stream DIC can also be used to infer the C-14 activity of discharging groundwater. This method may be a useful alternative to direct groundwater sampling, particularly in remote basins with few groundwater wells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

25,25,"Cheng, C",Jun 2017 ,Effects of side-stream ratio on sludge reduction and microbial structures of anaerobic side-stream reactor coupled membrane bioreactors,BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY,"An anoxic/oxic membrane bioreactor (AO-MBR) and three anaerobic side-stream reactor (ASSR) coupled MBRs (ASSR-MBR) were operated to investigate effects of side-stream ratio (SR) on sludge reduction and microbial community structure of ASSR-MBRs. The ASSR-MBR achieved efficient COD and ammonium nitrogen removal. SR increased from 0.2 to 1.0 favored nitrogen removal, and increased sludge reduction from 6.0% to 49.7%. The total released COD in the ASSR increased with the rising SR and was inversely proportional to sludge yield of ASSR-MBR. Pyrosequencing analysis showed that phyla Chloroflexi and Armatimonadetes surviving in anaerobic conditions were enriched in the ASSR, while Nitrospirae was dominant in the MBR. Comparison at the genus level revealed that higher SR favored the growth of slow growers, while lower SR enriched hydrolytic and predatory bacteria. The results suggested that SR has a profound effect on nitrogen removal, sludge reduction and microbial community structure in the ASSR-MBR. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

26,26,"Laveti, NVS",Nov 2021 ,Impact of anthropogenic activities on river-aquifer exchange flux in an irrigation dominated Ganga river sub-basin,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The easy accessibility of groundwater in the alluvial plains of the Kosi river basin has considerably altered the crop calendar and farmers' irrigation response, especially in the dry years after 2004. The present study attempts to develop a framework for analyzing the spatio-temporal variation in the groundwater recharge/ extraction pattern as well as river and aquifer flux exchange due to increasing anthropogenic activities in the basin. The influence of anthropogenic activities over groundwater recharge/extraction statistics has been discussed in Laveti et al. (2021). The estimated groundwater recharge (Laveti et al., 2021) along with aquifer characteristics (hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and specific storage), and riverbed conductance were used as inputs to the groundwater flow transient model in the study. The model observed, an increasing groundwater dependency for agricultural activities, results in a continuous increase of flux from the river to the aquifer. Between 1997 and 2010, the river to aquifer flux increased by almost 1% of the average river discharge. This increase in river to aquifer flux exchange was evident, especially during the dry periods after 2004, which coincided with the government's Million Shallow Tube Well Programme (MSTP) in the basin. The increasing trend of the river to aquifer flux transfer and the decreasing trend of the aquifer to river flux transfer observed in the Kosi basin can have disturbing long-term effects in terms of reduced river flow and river stage. Therefore, the concerned authorities and the stakeholders must take immediate notice of the observations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000704794400086,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B126811%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2Banthropogenic%2Bactivities%2Bon%2Briver-aquifer%2Bexchange%2Bflux%2Bin%2Ban%2Birrigation%2Bdominated%2BGanga%2Briver%2Bsub-basin%26rft.aufirst%3DNaga%2BVenkata%2BSatish%26rft.auinit%3DNVS%26rft.aulast%3DLaveti%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2021.126811%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D602%26rft.au%3DLaveti%252C%2BNVS%26rft.au%3DBanerjee%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DDutta%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126811,"River-aquifer interaction,Groundwater flow modelling,Anthropogenic activities,Indian basins,Groundwater recharge,Actual evapotranspiration","GROUNDWATER INTERACTION,SURFACE-WATER,REGIONAL-SCALE,FLOW,TEMPERATURE,PATTERNS,MODEL,BIHAR",,"Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India"
27,27,"Turlan, T",2007 ,Comparative use of field and laboratory mesocosms for in-stream nitrate uptake measurement,ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"Recent publications suggest that in large watersheds a large proportion (20 to 70%) of the net nitrogen input to the aquatic environment may be removed during water's downstream path towards the outlet. In small watersheds there are few to no evaluations of the importance of in-stream processes in the overall nitrogen budget due in part to the lack of simple and robust methods for measuring in-stream nitrate uptake. We propose a comparative study for laboratory and field measurements on open mesocosms, 30 cm in diameter. Nitrate uptake was evaluated from the kinetics of disappearance of nitrate in water overlying undisturbed sediment cores, both in the laboratory and in-situ. Using both laboratory and in-situ mesocosms was an effort to determine whether the methods were comparable and applicable on a routine basis. Nitrate disappearance kinetics in the laboratory yielded expected results, which are that nitrate uptake rates are linearly correlated to nitrate concentration in the water column. In such conditions, our results show that the potential for nitrate uptake in streams can be calculated from the mass transfer coefficient. Our comparative study shows that incubations conducted in the laboratory intrinsically limit hyporheic exchanges. associated with small water level fluctuations, which may in fact prevail in the field as the in-situ incubations have shown. In-situ experiments yielded unexpected results, such as the succession of disappearance and gain of nitrate in the mesocosms through time. This was attributed to hyporheic exchanges, both natural and artificially induced by the design of the mesocosms. Both methods should be considered for future nitrate uptake studies as they yield complementary results, provided that some simple changes are made in the design of in-situ mesocosms.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000245376100005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DComparative%2Buse%2Bof%2Bfield%2Band%2Blaboratory%2Bmesocosms%2Bfor%2Bin-stream%2Bnitrate%2Buptake%2Bmeasurement%26rft.aufirst%3DT.%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DTurlan%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Flimn%252F2007026%26rft.epage%3D51%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-4088%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DANNALES%2BDE%2BLIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D41-51%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D41%26rft.stitle%3DANN%2BLIMNOL-INT%2BJ%2BLIM%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DTurlan%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DBirgand%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DMarmonier%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=ANNALES+DE+LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1051/limn/2007026,"in-stream processes,nitrate uptake,mesocosm,method,mass transfer coefficient","SEASONAL-VARIATION,COASTAL WATERS,DENITRIFICATION,NITROGEN,EUTROPHICATION,CONSEQUENCES,SEDIMENTS,REMOVAL,TRANSFORMATION,ECOSYSTEM",,"Cemagref, UR Hydrosyst & Bioprocedes, Parc Tourvoie,BP 44, F-92163 Antony, France"
28,28,"Redzovic, Z",Mar 25 2023 ,Metal bioaccumulation in stygophilous amphipod Synurella ambulans in the hyporheic zone: The influence of environmental factors,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Given the increasing need to protect vulnerable freshwater ecosystems and make them more resilient to human use and climate change, biomonitoring of the hyporheic zone (HZ), which plays a critical role in pollution attenuation, is essential. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of the amphipod species Synurella ambulans as a bioindicator of metal contamination in the HZ of the Sava River (Croatia). Amphipods were collected during the four seasons at two sampling sites (average sampling depth 55 cm) differing in type (agricultural and urban) and intensity (diffuse and point source contamination) of anthropogenic influence, one located upstream (Medsave), and the other downstream (Jarun) of the wastewater treatment plant discharge. Concentrations of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sn, Zn, Ca, K, Mg and Na were measured in the interstitial water, sediments and specimens of S. ambulans by HR ICP-MS. Physicochemical parameters (temperature, DO, O2 saturation, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, total water hardness, CODKMnO4, nutrients) were measured in the interstitial water, while organic carbon was measured in the interstitial water and sediments. Metal concentrations in interstitial water and sediments were below thresholds set by environmental quality standards. Metal concentrations in S. ambulans were classified as follows: higher at the Jarun site (Al, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sn), higher at the Medsave site (Cd, Cu, Rb) and mostly comparable at both sites (Co, Mn, Zn). Bioaccumulation factors were generally higher at Jarun, with average values ranging from 322 to 143,278 L kg-1. Bioaccumulation of metals in S. ambulans depended on various environmental factors, with metal exposure level and dissolved macro elements showing the strongest association with metals accumulated in S. ambulans. The findings provided the first evidence on the suitability of S. ambulans as a good bioindicator of chronic metal contamination in the HZ.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000921869300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B161350%26rft.atitle%3DMetal%2Bbioaccumulation%2Bin%2Bstygophilous%2Bamphipod%2BSynurella%2Bambulans%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2BThe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Benvironmental%2Bfactors%26rft.aufirst%3DZuzana%26rft.auinit%3DZ%26rft.aulast%3DRedzovic%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.scitotenv.2022.161350%26rft.eissn%3D1879-1026%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0048-9697%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENCE%2BOF%2BTHE%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BTOTAL%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D866%26rft.au%3DRedzovic%252C%2BZ%26rft.au%3DErk%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DCindric%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=SCIENCE+OF+THE+TOTAL+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161350,"The Sava River,Croatia,Crustaceans,Bioindicator,Groundwater connected ecosystems,Anthropogenic impact","FRESH-WATER AMPHIPOD,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,HEAVY-METALS,TRACE-METALS,TALITRID AMPHIPODS,QUALITY GUIDELINES,SEDIMENT,ACCUMULATION,CRUSTACEA,TOXICITY",,"Rudjer Boskovic Inst, Div Mol Med, Lab Bioanalyt, Bijenicka cesta 54, Zagreb 10000, Croatia"

Based on panel data of nine provinces in the Yellow River Basin from 2010 to 2019, models such as entropy TOPSIS, the super-SBM model, the coupling coordination degree model, the GM (1,1) model, Tobit regression, and other methods were used to explore the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and influencing factors of the coupling coordination degree (CCD) between new-type urbanization and tourism resource conversion efficiency (TRCE) in the Yellow River Basin. The results show that, during the research period: (1) The development index of new-type urbanization in the Yellow River Basin showed a steady upwards trend and TRCE was generally stable. (2) The CCD between new-type urbanization and TRCE in the Yellow River Basin fluctuated and rose with an average annual CCD of 0.716, indicating an intermediate coordination stage, and showed an overall spatial distribution pattern of ""midstream region > downstream region > upstream region"". The center of gravity of the CCD shifted to the northwest and the type of CCD jumped rapidly to a better stage, especially in the midstream region. From the perspective of future trends, the coupling and coordination relationship between the two major systems will continue to be optimized from 2019 to 2025 and the midstream region will maintain a high growth level. (3) The industrial structure, cultural media investment, science and technology investment, and communication level are important factors that affect the CCD of new-type urbanization and TRCE in the Yellow River Basin. The CCD of new-type urbanization and TRCE in the Yellow River Basin tends to be better as a whole, but the regional differences are obvious. Therefore, in the process of policy implementation, special attention should be given to the understanding of regional differences to avoid policy failure. This is very important to the Yellow River Basin and equally important to other regions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000881580200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B14007%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BCoupling%2BRelationship%2Bbetween%2BNew-Type%2BUrbanization%2Band%2BTourism%2BResource%2BConversion%2BEfficiency%253A%2BA%2BCase%2BStudy%2Bof%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BBasin%2Bin%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DMing%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DHao%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fsu142114007%26rft.eissn%3D2071-1050%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D21%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DHao%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DLiang%252C%2BLT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/su142114007,"urbanization,tourism industry development,coupling relation,Yellow River Basin","ECONOMIC-GROWTH,URBAN TOURISM,COORDINATION,DESTINATIONS,CITY",,"Henan Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China"

State-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, like DeepLab and PSPNet, make full use of multiple feature information to improve spatial resolution. However, the feature resolution in the scale-axis is not dense enough for practical applications. To tackle this problem, a multi-stream network is designed with atrous convolutional layers at multiple rates to capture objects and context at multiple scales. Furthermore, intra-connections and inter-connections are designed to fuse multi-scale features densely which produce a feature pyramid with much larger scale diversity and larger receptive field by involving small quantity of computation. The proposed module can be easily used in other methods and it helps to increase the performance. Compared with existing methods, the proposed network, called Multi-stream Densely Connected Network, reaches competitive results on ADE20K dataset, PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, and Cityscapes dataset.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000726565800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMulti-stream%2Bdensely%2Bconnected%2Bnetwork%2Bfor%2Bsemantic%2Bsegmentation%26rft.aufirst%3DDayu%26rft.auinit%3DDY%26rft.aulast%3DJia%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1049%252Fcvi2.12078%26rft.eissn%3D1751-9640%26rft.epage%3D191%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1751-9632%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DIET%2BCOMPUTER%2BVISION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D180-191%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D180%26rft.stitle%3DIET%2BCOMPUT%2BVIS%26rft.volume%3D16%26rft.au%3DJia%252C%2BDY%26rft.au%3DCao%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DPang%252C%2BYW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=IET+COMPUTER+VISION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1049/cvi2.12078,"computer vision,image processing,image segmentation",,,"Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China"

The Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) and a novel dynamic-coupling tool were used to link three EFDC hydrodynamic models corresponding to Mobile Bay, Weeks Bay, and the Fish River. The dynamically-coupled models were used to simulate inundation scenarios for combinations of 2-, 7.5-, 10-, 25-, and 100-year floods, and the hurricane surge that occurred during hurricane Katrina. The nested and dynamically-coupled model was developed using available public-access bathymetry and topography databases (National Elevation Dataset, and NOAA bathymetry), and run without recurring to calibration techniques. The simulation of combined scenarios showed that inundated areas increase from 0.07 % up to 189 % with respect to the actual flood that took place during the Katrina event (Katrina+1-year flood). The results suggest that increases in inundated area are relatively much higher from a 1-year flood to a 7.5 year-flood (128 % flooded area increase) than for higher return periods. For the 25-year and the 100-year floods, inundated areas almost triple from the area corresponding to the base-case (Katrina event), with percent increases of 182 % and 189 % respectively.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000338651100031,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNested%2BHydrodynamic%2BModeling%2Bof%2Ba%2BCoastal%2BRiver%2BApplying%2BDynamic-Coupling%26rft.aufirst%3DV.%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DVJ%26rft.aulast%3DAlarcon%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-014-0671-6%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1650%26rft.epage%3D3240%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3227-3240%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3227%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DAlarcon%252C%2BVJ%26rft.au%3DJohnson%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DCartwright%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11269-014-0671-6,"Hydrodynamic modeling,EFDC,Flooding,Inundation,Dynamic-coupling","POLLUTANT TRANSPORT,SIMULATION,BAY",,"Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, 441 Ejercito Ave, Santiago, Chile"

This exchange is suggestive of significant cross-stream eddy mixing, but in order to accurately interpret the float exchange in terms of property exchange the location of float deployment was assessed relative to the strong potential vorticity front associated with the Gulf Stream. The basic result of this analysis is that most of the observed float exchange is not representative of cross-frontal exchange. At the level where a strong potential vorticity front is present, some fluid particles escape from the jet, but most of them stay on the same side of the front. In the deep main thermocline, significant particle exchange is observed between the Gulf Stream and fluid on both sides of the jet, but this exchange is indicative of particles circulating in a relatively homogeneous pool of potential vorticity and thus does not signify a cross-stream property flux. These characteristics of particle exchange in the Gulf Stream are found to be generally compatible with the results from a study of particle behavior in a quasigeostrophic eddy-resolving GCM.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1994NT49200019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BCLOSER%2BLOOK%2BAT%2BPARTICLE%2BEXCHANGE%2BIN%2BTHE%2BGULF-STREAM%26rft.aufirst%3DAS%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DBOWER%26rft.date%3D1994%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1175%252F1520-0485%25281994%2529024%253C1399%253AACLAPE%253E2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D1418%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-3670%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BPHYSICAL%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1399-1418%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1399%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BPHYS%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DBOWER%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DLOZIER%252C%2BMS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+PHYSICAL+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1175/1520-0485(1994)024<1399:ACLAPE>2.0.CO;2,,"QUASI-GEOSTROPHIC OCEAN,POTENTIAL VORTICITY,BOUNDARY CURRENTS,CAPE-HATTERAS,TRANSPORT,CIRCULATION,TRAJECTORIES,MEANDERS",,"WOODS HOLE OCEANOG INST,WOODS HOLE,MA 02543, USA"
33,33,"Engeler, I",Feb 3 2011 ,The importance of coupled modelling of variably saturated groundwater flow-heat transport for assessing river-aquifer interactions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"This paper focuses on the role of heat transport in river-aquifer interactions for the study area Hardhof located in the Limmat valley within the city of Zurich (Switzerland). On site there are drinking water production facilities of Zurich water supply, which pump groundwater and infiltrate bank filtration water from river Limmat. The artificial recharge by basins and by wells creates a hydraulic barrier against the potentially contaminated groundwater flow from the city.A three-dimensional finite element model of the coupled variably saturated groundwater flow and heat transport was developed. The hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the leakage coefficient of the riverbed were calibrated for isothermal conditions by inverse modelling, using the pilot point method. River-aquifer interaction was modelled using a leakage concept. Coupling was considered by temperature-dependent values for hydraulic conductivity and for leakage coefficients. The quality of the coupled model was tested with the help of head and temperature measurements. Good correspondence between simulated and measured temperatures was found for the three pumping wells and seven piezometers. However, deviations were observed for one pumping well and two piezometers, which are situated in an area, where zones with important hydrogeological heterogeneity are expected. A comparison of simulation results with isothermal leakage coefficients with those of temperature-dependent leakage coefficients shows that the temperature dependence is able to reduce the head residuals close to the river by up to 30%. The largest improvements are found in the zone, where the river stage is considerably higher than the groundwater level, which is in correspondence with the expectations.Additional analyses also showed that the linear leakage concept cannot reproduce the seepage flux in a downstream section during flood events. It was found that infiltration is enhanced during flood events, which is attributed to additional infiltration areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, sUAS-based vegetation imagery, vegetation-top elevation, and normalized difference vegetation index mapping indicated GW-SW exchange patterns that are difficult to characterize from the land surface and may not be resolved from coarser satellite-based imagery.

This paper deals, in assistance with the streaming potential test apparatus, with the streaming potential effect response of SRM subjected to different rock contents. The test results show that when the rock content increases from 10% to 30%, the streaming potential coupling coefficient increases with the increases in rock content at 85% compactness and 0.01 mol L-1 salinity. When the rock content is more than 30%, the streaming potential coupling coefficient decreases with the increases in rock content. As the rock content increases, the permeability coefficient has a negative correlation with the streaming potential coupling coefficient. The streaming potential increases first and then goes down with the increases in rock content, and the streaming potential decreases significantly when the rock content exceeds 50%. The findings indicate that the rock content is the key structural factor that restricts the streaming potential phenomenon of the SRM.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000748239800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B585%26rft.atitle%3DUnderstanding%2Bthe%2BInfluence%2Bof%2BRock%2BContent%2Bon%2BStreaming%2BPotential%2BPhenomenon%2Bof%2BSoil-Rock%2BMixture%253A%2BAn%2BExperimental%2BStudy%26rft.aufirst%3DXin%26rft.auinit%3DX%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fs22020585%26rft.eissn%3D1424-8220%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DSENSORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSENSORS-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BX%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=SENSORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/s22020585,"soil-rock mixture,streaming potential coupling coefficient,streaming potential,rock content","STOCHASTIC JOINT INVERSION,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS,PERMEABILITY,COEFFICIENT,WATER,DAMS,TEMPERATURE,DEPENDENCE,GRAVEL",,"Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Engn Res Ctr Diag Technol & Instruments Hydrocons, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China"
36,36,"Fisher, SG",Feb 1998 ,"Hierarchy, spatial configuration, and nutrient cycling in a desert stream",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Recent studies of nutrient cycling in Sycamore Creek in Arizona, USA, suggest that a thorough understanding requires a spatially explicit, hierarchical approach. Physical configuration determines the path that water follows as it moves downstream. Water follows flowpaths through surface stream components, the hyporheic zone beneath the surface stream, and the parafluvial (sand bar) zone. Characteristic biogeochemical processes in these subsystems alter nitrogen (N) species in transport, in part as a function of available concentrations of N species. At several hierarchical levels, substrate materials are an important determinant of nitrogen dynamics in desert streams. Sand is present in bars of variable size and shape, each of which can be considered a unit, interacting with the surface stream. Groups of these stream-sandbar units form a higher level, the reach. At the next higher scale, sandy reaches (runs) alternate with riffles. Where flowpaths converge, rates of N transformation are high and, as a result, change in concentration is a non-linear function of flowpath length. Disturbance by flash floods alters sandbar configuration. Between floods, the interaction of subsurface and surface flowpaths shapes configuration in each, thus a self-organizing element of spatial structure exists. Sandy runs are dominated by subsurface processes and are likely to be net nitrifiers while riffles are dominated by surface flow and are nitrogen fixers. Whether a stream ecosystem retains nitrogen, or transports it to downstream recipient systems, or is a net emitter of gaseous forms of N, depends upon the dynamics of a spatial mosaic of interacting elements. An understanding of the net effect of this mosaic requires a spatially explicit, hierarchical, multi-scale approach.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000072219000004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHierarchy%252C%2Bspatial%2Bconfiguration%252C%2Band%2Bnutrient%2Bcycling%2Bin%2Ba%2Bdesert%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DSG%26rft.auinit%3DSG%26rft.aulast%3DFisher%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1442-9993.1998.tb00704.x%26rft.epage%3D52%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0307-692X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAUSTRALIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D41-52%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D41%26rft.stitle%3DAUST%2BJ%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DFisher%252C%2BSG%26rft.au%3DGrimm%252C%2BNB%26rft.au%3DGomez%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=AUSTRALIAN+JOURNAL+OF+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1442-9993.1998.tb00704.x,"hierarchy,hydrology,nitrogen,nutrients,patch dynamics,scale,spatial configuration,streams","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,HYPORHEIC ZONE,ECOSYSTEM,PERSPECTIVE,TRANSPORT,PATTERN",,"Arizona State Univ, Dept Zool, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA"
37,37,"Mallard, J",Jun 2014 ,"Lateral inflows, stream-groundwater exchange, and network geometry influence stream water composition",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The role of stream networks and their hydrologic interaction with hillslopes and shallow groundwater in modifying and transporting watershed signals is an area of active research. One of the primary ways that stream networks can modify watershed signals is through spatially variable stream gains and losses, described herein as hydrologic turnover. We measured hydrologic gain and loss at the reach scale using tracer experiments throughout the Bull Trout watershed in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho. We extended the results of reach scale experiments to the stream network using empirical relationships between (1) watershed area and stream discharge and (2) stream discharge and percent stream water loss to the groundwater system. We thus incorporate linkages between (1) hillslopes and stream networks via lateral inflows and (2) stream networks and shallow groundwater via hydrologic exchange. We implemented these relationships within a concise analytical framework to simulate hydrologic turnover across stream networks and estimate the variable influence exerted by upstream reaches and streamflow source locations on stream water composition across stream networks. Application to six natural Sawtooth watersheds and seven synthetic watersheds with varying topographic structure and stream network geometry indicated that contributions to discharge from any upstream source depend on the magnitude of the initial input, but also on the distribution of hydrologic turnover occurring along the stream network. The evolution of stream water source compositions along stream networks was unique in each watershed due to the combination of watershed structure and stream network geometry. Our results suggest that a distributed representation of hydrologic turnover at the stream network scale can improve understanding of how the stream network can modify source water compositions along the stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000340430400004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLateral%2Binflows%252C%2Bstream-groundwater%2Bexchange%252C%2Band%2Bnetwork%2Bgeometry%2Binfluence%2Bstream%2Bwater%2Bcomposition%26rft.aufirst%3DJohn%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DMallard%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR014944%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4623%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4603-4623%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4603%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DMallard%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DMcGlynn%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DCovino%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR014944,,"INSTANTANEOUS UNIT-HYDROGRAPH,CATCHMENT TRANSIT-TIME,KINEMATIC DISPERSION,SCALE,CHEMISTRY,RUNOFF,TRACER,BASIN,CONNECTIVITY,PERSPECTIVE",,"Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA"

The groundwater and surface water are hydraulically connected through numerous karst forms which facilitate the exchange of water between the surface and subsurface. A complex underground conduit system is an inherent characteristic karst system analysed. Groundwater and surface water exchange with both adjacent and distant aquifers through underground routes or inflows from surface streams and artificial reservoirs. Because of a complex surface and underground karst features, which strongly influenced its hydrological and hydrogeological regime, the main open stream flow, with a longitude of about 106 km, undergoes eight name changes. In this paper, it is noted as ""the eight-name river"". In fact, it represents one river with losing, sinking and underground stream sections. Different surface and underground karst forms play crucial roles in the way the water flowing over the surface and on the underground sections of its catchment. The analysed area is full of varied and often spectacular surface landforms, including for example the Blue and Red Lakes and the Kravice Waterfall. The analyses made in the paper show the existence of a decreasing trend of mean annual discharges on the eight-name river, which can cause numerous problems in the regional water resource management of this transboundary river and catchment.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000323737300043,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DKarst%2Brivers%2527%2Bparticularity%253A%2Ban%2Bexample%2Bfrom%2BDinaric%2Bkarst%2B%2528Croatia%252FBosnia%2Band%2BHerzegovina%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DOgnjen%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DBonacci%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-012-2187-9%26rft.epage%3D974%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D963-974%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D963%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D70%26rft.au%3DBonacci%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DZeljkovic%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DGalic%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-012-2187-9,"Karst hydrology,Karst river,Polje,Dinaric karst","CATCHMENT-AREA,WATER,GEOMORPHOLOGY,CONDUITS,SYSTEM",,"Split Univ, Fac Civil Engn Architecture & Geodesy, Matice Hrvatske 15, Split 21000, Croatia"
39,39,"Conner, A",Apr 8 2021 ,Groundwater Inflows to the Columbia River Along the Hanford Reach and Associated Nitrate Concentrations,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Healthy river ecosystems require the interaction of many physical and biological processes to maintain their status. One physical process supporting biogeochemical cycling is hydrologic exchange (i.e., hydrologic exchange flows, HEFs) between relatively fast-flowing channel waters and slower-flowing surface and subsurface waters (lateral and vertical). Land uses adjacent to rivers have the potential to alter the water quality of off-channel surface and subsurface waters, and HEFs therefore have the potential to deliver solutes associated with river-adjacent land uses to rivers. HEFs can be nonpoint, diffuse sources of pollution, making the ultimate pollution source difficult to identify, especially in large rivers. Here, we seek to identify HEFs in the Columbia River near Richland, WA by looking for anomalies in temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) along the bed of the river in February, June, July, August, and November 2018. These are ultimately the ""ends"" of HEFs as they are locations of subsurface inflow to the river. We found these anomalies to be a combination of warmer or colder and higher (but not lower) EC than river water. We identified a majority of warm anomalies in February and July 2018, and majority cold anomalies in June, August, and November 2018. High-EC anomalies were found mostly in February, August, and November. Combined, we observe a shift from warm, high EC anomalies dominating in February to equivalent EC, warm anomalies in June, to equivalent EC, cool anomalies dominating July. In August, we also measured dissolved nitrate (NO3-) in-situ to determine whether anomalies were associated with increased NO3- loading to the river, especially along the eastern shoreline, which is dominated by agricultural land use. Inflows along the eastern shoreline have greater concentrations of nitrate than river water (up to 10 mg N-NO3-/L). This research demonstrates that HEFs are temporally and spatially dynamic transferring heat and solutes to rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000677584300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B574684%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater%2BInflows%2Bto%2Bthe%2BColumbia%2BRiver%2BAlong%2Bthe%2BHanford%2BReach%2Band%2BAssociated%2BNitrate%2BConcentrations%26rft.aufirst%3DAbigail%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DConner%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2021.574684%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D3%26rft.au%3DConner%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DGarayburu-Caruso%252C%2BV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/frwa.2021.574684,"stream-groundwater interaction,groundwater inflow,water quality,Columbia River,Hanford Reach,hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs)","HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,WATER,FLOW,DISCHARGE,DYNAMICS,STORAGE",,"Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA"
40,40,"Zipper, S",Jul 1 2022 ,Alternative stable states and hydrological regime shifts in a large intermittent river,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Non-perennial rivers and streams make up over half the global river network and are becoming more widespread. Transitions from perennial to non-perennial flow are a threshold-type change that can lead to alternative stable states in aquatic ecosystems, but it is unknown whether streamflow itself is stable in either wet (flowing) or dry (no-flow) conditions. Here, we investigated drivers and feedbacks associated with regime shifts between wet and dry conditions in an intermittent reach of the Arkansas River (USA) over the past 23 years. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that these regimes represent alternative stable states, including (a) significant jumps in discharge time series that were not accompanied by jumps in flow drivers such as precipitation and groundwater pumping; (b) a multi-modal state distribution with 92% of months experiencing no-flow conditions for 90% of days, despite unimodal distributions of precipitation and pumping; and (c) a hysteretic relationship between climate and flow state. Groundwater levels appear to be the primary control over the hydrological regime, as groundwater levels in the alluvial aquifer were higher than the stream stage during wet regimes and lower than the streambed during dry regimes. Groundwater level variation, in turn, was driven by processes occurring at both the regional scale (surface water inflows from upstream, groundwater pumping) and the reach scale (stream-aquifer exchange, diffuse recharge through the soil column). Historical regime shifts were associated with diverse pressures including network disconnection caused by upstream water use, increased flow stability potentially associated with reservoir operations, and anomalous wet and dry climate conditions. In sum, stabilizing feedbacks among upstream inflows, stream-aquifer interactions, climate, vegetation, and pumping appear to create alternative wet and dry stable states at this site. These stabilizing feedbacks suggest that widespread observed shifts from perennial to non-perennial flow will be difficult to reverse.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000810737500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B074005%26rft.atitle%3DAlternative%2Bstable%2Bstates%2Band%2Bhydrological%2Bregime%2Bshifts%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bintermittent%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DSam%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DZipper%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1088%252F1748-9326%252Fac7539%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1748-9326%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DZipper%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DPopescu%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DSeybold%252C%2BEC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1088/1748-9326/ac7539,"regime shifts,hydrology,intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams,complex systems,hydrological resilience,ecohydrology,stream-aquifer interactions","GROUNDWATER RECHARGE,AQUIFER,ATTRACTORS,INFILTRATION,TRAJECTORIES,THRESHOLDS,ECOSYSTEMS,DECLINES,MODELS",,"Univ Kansas, Kansas Geol Survey, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA"

Through theoretical analysis, this model coupled both surface and subsurface flow. Flume experiments with flat cobble bed were conducted to examine the theoretical model. Results show that both the turbulent flow field and the total flow characteristics are quite different from that in the low gradient flow over microscale roughness. The velocity profile in a shallow stream converges to the logarithmic law away from the bed, while inflecting over the roughness layer to the non-zero subsurface flow. The velocity fluctuations close to a cobble bed are different from that of a sand bed, and it indicates no sufficiently large peak velocity. The total flow energy loss deviates significantly from the 1/7 power law equation when the relative flow depth is shallow. Both the coupled model and experiments indicate non-negligible subsurface flow that accounts for a considerable proportion of the total flow. By including the subsurface flow, the coupled model is able to predict a wider range of velocity profiles and total flow energy loss coefficients when compared with existing equations.

42,42,"Mirbozorgi, SA",Oct 2007 ,Streaming electric potential in pressure-driven flows through reservoir-connected microchannels,JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,"Electrical power generation employing pressure-driven flows is a fundamental problem in microfluidics. In the present work, analytical and numerical analyses are performed to study the interplaying effects of electrolyte motion with the associated electrical current in a flat microchannel with and without fluid reservoirs. The modified Navier-Stokes equations as well as a Poisson equation for the distribution of electric potential and the Nernst-Planck equations for the distribution of charge densities are solved for the steady flow of a Newtonian liquid. The results show that for a pressure-driven flow, all electric potential is induced due to the motion of charged particles, which increases linearly along the microchannel. This streaming potential generates all opposing conduction current in the core region of the channel as well as in the immediate vicinity of the walls, where the streaming current is negligible.

43,43,"Cardenas, MB",Nov 30 2006 ,The influence of ambient groundwater discharge on exchange zones induced by current-bedform interactions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"We use numerical modeling to investigate the interactions between laminar flow in a water column, current-bedform induced flow in underlying permeable sediments, and discharge of deep groundwater to the water column. Groundwater discharge reduces the spatial extent of current-induced exchange zones within the sediments and may completely prevent the development of current-bedform induced flow at high groundwater discharge. Although exchange zone size is reduced by groundwater discharge, the reduction in exchange flux is not significant, suggesting reduced residence times of materials cycled through these smaller zones. Fluid exchange zones tend to be centered around the reattachment points of eddies that also mark the location of flow divides within the sediments; while deep groundwater is discharged preferentially along troughs. Exchange zone depth and the water column Reynolds number are functionally related through a Morgan-Mercer-Flodin model. The relationship between the current-induced flux through the sediments and the Reynolds number is described by low-order monotonic polynomial functions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

44,44,"Kaser, D",Nov-dec 2014 ,Channel Representation in Physically Based Models Coupling Groundwater and Surface Water: Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them,GROUNDWATER,"Recent models that couple three-dimensional subsurface flow with two-dimensional overland flow are valuable tools for quantifying complex groundwater/stream interactions and for evaluating their influence on watershed processes. For the modeler who is used to defining streams as a boundary condition, the representation of channels in integrated models raises a number of conceptual and technical issues. These models are far more sensitive to channel topography than conventional groundwater models. On all spatial scales, both the topography of a channel and its connection with the floodplain are important. For example, the geometry of river banks influences bank storage and overbank flooding; the slope of the river is a primary control on the behavior of a catchment; and at the finer scale bedform characteristics affect hyporheic exchange. Accurate data on streambed topography, however, are seldom available, and the spatial resolution of digital elevation models is typically too coarse in river environments, resulting in unrealistic or undulating streambeds. Modelers therefore perform some kind of manual yet often cumbersome correction to the available topography. In this context, the paper identifies some common pitfalls, and provides guidance to overcome these. Both aspects of topographic representation and mesh discretization are addressed. Additionally, two tutorials are provided to illustrate: (1) the interpolation of channel cross-sectional data and (2) the refinement of a mesh along a stream in areas of high topographic variability.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000347980500008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DChannel%2BRepresentation%2Bin%2BPhysically%2BBased%2BModels%2BCoupling%2BGroundwater%2Band%2BSurface%2BWater%253A%2BPitfalls%2Band%2BHow%2Bto%2BAvoid%2BThem%26rft.aufirst%3DDaniel%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DKaeser%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12143%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D836%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D827-836%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D827%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DKaser%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DGraf%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DBrunner%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gwat.12143,,"RESOLUTION TOPOGRAPHIC DATA,FLOOD INUNDATION,RIVER,EXCHANGE,LIDAR,VEGETATION,ROUGHNESS",,"Ctr Hydrogeol & Geotherm, 11 Rue Emile Argand, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland"

To better understand the environmental and health risks associated with the release of TiO2 nanoparticles, knowledge on their fate and transport is needed. This study evaluates the transport of two different TiO2 nanoparticles: one commercially available (P25 TiO2) and the other synthesized at a lab scale (synthesized TiO2). Laboratory flume, column, and batch experiments were conducted to investigate the processes dominating the transport of TiO2 nanoparticles between streams and streambeds and to characterize the properties of these nanoparticles under different physicochemical conditions. Results show that the synthesized TiO2 was more stable compared to the P25 TiO2, which underwent significant aggregation under the same experimental conditions. As a result P25 TiO2 deposited at a faster rate than the synthesized TiO2 in the streambed. Both types of TiO2 nanoparticles deposited in the streambed were easily released when the stream velocity was increased. The aggregation and deposition of P25 TiO2 were highly dependent on pH. A process-based colloid exchange model was applied to interpret the observed transport behavior of the TiO2 nanoparticles,Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000270594900021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExchange%2Bof%2BTiO2%2BNanoparticles%2Bbetween%2BStreams%2Band%2BStreambeds%26rft.aufirst%3DNatalia%26rft.auinit%3DNT%26rft.aulast%3DTiciana%2BBoncagni%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes900424n%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D7705%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D20%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7699-7705%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7699%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DBoncagni%252C%2BNT%26rft.au%3DOtaegui%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DDe%2BCortalezzi%252C%2BMMF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es900424n,,"TITANIUM-DIOXIDE,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,HYPORHEIC ZONE,WATER,NANOMATERIALS,MOBILIZATION,FILTRATION,EFFICIENCY",,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA"

Based on the panel data of 11 provinces and municipalities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2009 to 2019, this paper constructs the evaluation index system of the logistics industry, new urbanization and the ecological environment. The entropy method, coupled coordination degree model and exploratory spatial data analysis method are used to empirically analyze the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of the coupled coordination of the three systems in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The results show that: (1) during the study period, the comprehensive development level of each subsystem and composite system in the Yangtze River Economic Belt has been improving, but there are some differences in the development among the systems in each region; (2) the coupling coordination degree of the three shows a smooth upward trend and an overall transition from near incoordination or basic coordination to the level of primary coordination or intermediate coordination, showing a spatial distribution pattern of downstream > midstream > upstream; (3) the spatial agglomeration characteristics show significant positive spatial correlation and agglomeration and are dominated by high-high agglomeration and low-low agglomeration. These reflect the enormous spatial and temporal differences in the coupling coordination of the three systems in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The study takes the perspective of the coupled and coordinated development of the logistics industry, new urbanization and the ecological environment, which can provide references for enterprises and governments to make sustainable industrial and urbanization development strategies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000796104000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B5298%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2BCoordination%2BDevelopment%2Bof%2Bthe%2BLogistics%2BIndustry%252C%2BNew%2BUrbanization%2Band%2Bthe%2BEcological%2BEnvironment%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%26rft.aufirst%3DChong%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DYe%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fsu14095298%26rft.eissn%3D2071-1050%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DYe%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DPi%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BHQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/su14095298,"Yangtze River Economic Belt,logistics industry,new urbanization,ecological environment,coupling and coordination","PERFORMANCE,GROWTH,SYSTEM,CHINA,PERSPECTIVE,IMPACTS,REGION,INDEX,CITY",,"Univ Sunderland, SEGi Coll Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur 47810, Malaysia"

In the Study area, wind action predominates from March to June, which erodes weathered bedrock and transports eolian sand to gullies, river channels and floodplains. In the following Summer, especially from July to September, rainstorm runoff in gullies and river channels transports large quantities of fine loessic material, in the form of hyperconcentrated flow. As a result, most of the previously stored eolian sand and material supplied by mass-wasting of loess can be transported to the major tributaries and the main stream of the Yellow River, resulting in the high specific sediment yield. There exists all optimal grain size composition which maximizes Suspended sediment concentration in the study area, resulted from the combined wind-water processes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We present a conceptual model in which solute retention in streams results from hydrologic retention (increased water residence time resulting from surface-groundwater exchange), biological nutrient cycling, and chemical processes. Solute injection experiments were done in study catchments comprised of sandstone-siltstone (site 1), volcanic tuff (site 2), and granite-gneiss (site 3). Distribution of an injected conservative tracer (Br) illustrated that rate and extent of surface-water penetration into the alluvial aquifer increased across study catchments as was predicted from increasing alluvial hydraulic conductivity. Concurrently, groundwater inputs at baseflow represented between 13 and 57% of aboveground discharge at upstream transects, indicating bidirectional hydrologic exchange along the study reaches. N:P ratios in surface water ranged from 4 to 16, suggesting strong biotic demand for inorganic N. Coinjection of NaBr and NaNO3 revealed longest nitrate uptake length (S-w) at site 1, intermediate S-w at site 2, and shortest uptake length at site 3. Modeling of transient hydrologic solute storage revealed that S-w correlated with hydraulic storage, suggesting an important role for subsurface processes in total nitrate retention.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1996UK85000015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DParent%2Blithology%252C%2Bsurface-groundwater%2Bexchange%252C%2Band%2Bnitrate%2Bretention%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DHM%26rft.auinit%3DHM%26rft.aulast%3DValett%26rft.date%3D1996%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.1996.41.2.0333%26rft.epage%3D345%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D333-345%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D333%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DValett%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DMorrice%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DCampana%252C%2BME&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FLfyCgDXBnO2iJQxhqNw&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.1996.41.2.0333,,"3RD-ORDER STREAM,MOUNTAIN STREAM,PHOSPHORUS RETENTION,WOODLAND STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,TRANSPORT,DYNAMICS,ECOSYSTEM,NITROGEN,CHANNEL",,"UNIV NEW MEXICO,DEPT BIOL,ALBUQUERQUE,NM 87131, USA"
