1,1,"Gariglio, FP",Nov 2013 ,Spatiotemporal variability of hyporheic exchange through a pool-riffle-pool sequence,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream water enters and exits the streambed sediment due to hyporheic fluxes, which stem primarily from the interaction between surface water hydraulics and streambed morphology. These fluxes sustain a rich ecotone, whose habitat quality depends on their direction and magnitude. The spatiotemporal variability of hyporheic fluxes is not well understood over several temporal scales and consequently, we studied their spatial and temporal variation over a pool-riffle-pool sequence at multiple locations from winter to summer. We instrumented a pool-riffle-pool sequence of Bear Valley Creek, an important salmonid spawning gravel-bed stream in central Idaho, with temperature monitoring probes recording at high temporal resolution (12 minute intervals). Using the thermal time series, weekly winter season seepage fluxes were calculated with a steady-state analytical solution and spring-summer fluxes with a new analytical solution that can also quantify the streambed thermal properties. Longitudinal pool-riffle-pool conceptualizations of downwelling and upwelling behavior were generally observed, except during the winter season when seepage fluxes tended toward downwelling conditions. Seepage fluxes near the edges of the channel were typically greater than fluxes near the center of the channel, and demonstrated greater seasonal variability. Results show that the interaction between streamflow and streambed topography has a primary control near the center of the channel, whereas the interaction between stream water and groundwater table has a primary control on seepage fluxes near the banks of the stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000328683800002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2Bvariability%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bthrough%2Ba%2Bpool-riffle-pool%2Bsequence%26rft.aufirst%3DFrank%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DFP%26rft.aulast%3DGariglio%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20419%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7204%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7185-7204%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7185%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DGariglio%252C%2BFP%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DLuce%252C%2BCH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20419,,"SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS,REDD SITE SELECTION,FALL CHINOOK SALMON,LOSING STREAM,FLUID-FLOW,TEMPERATURE,SURFACE,RIVER,ZONE",,"Univ Idaho, Coll Engn, Ctr Ecohydraul Res, 322 E Front St,Suite 340, Boise, ID 83702 USA"
2,2,"Huang, T",Feb 2022 ,Removal of Fecal Indicator Bacteria by River Networks,WATER,"Fecal contamination is a significant source of water quality impairment globally. Aquatic ecosystems can provide an important ecosystem service of fecal contamination removal. Understanding the processes that regulate the removal of fecal contamination among river networks across flow conditions is critical. We applied a river network model, the Framework for Aquatic Modeling in the Earth System (FrAMES-Ecoli), to quantify removal of fecal indicator bacteria by river networks across flow conditions during summers in a series of New England watersheds of different characteristics. FrAMES-Ecoli simulates sources, transport, and riverine removal of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Aquatic E. coli removal was simulated in both the water column and the hyporheic zone, and is a function of hydraulic conditions, flow exchange rates with the hyporheic zone, and die-off in each compartment. We found that, at the river network scale during summers, removal by river networks can be high (19-99%) with variability controlled by hydrologic conditions, watershed size, and distribution of sources in the watershed. Hydrology controls much of the variability, with 68-99% of network scale inputs removed under base flow conditions and 19-85% removed during storm events. Removal by the water column alone could not explain the observed pattern in E. coli, suggesting that processes such as hyporheic removal must be considered. These results suggest that river network removal of fecal indicator bacteria should be taken into consideration in managing fecal contamination at critical downstream receiving waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000762192500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B617%26rft.atitle%3DRemoval%2Bof%2BFecal%2BIndicator%2BBacteria%2Bby%2BRiver%2BNetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DTao%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DHuang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw14040617%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DWollheim%252C%2BWM%26rft.au%3DJones%252C%2BSH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w14040617,"fecal contamination,river network,regulating ecosystem service,hyporheic zone,water quality model,watershed hydrology","NATURAL SURFACE WATERS,ESCHERICHIA-COLI,SEASONAL VARIABILITY,MORTALITY-RATES,HYPORHEIC ZONE,LAND-COVER,TRANSPORT,QUALITY,MODEL,MICROORGANISMS",,"Boise State Univ, Human Environm Syst, Boise, ID 83725 USA"

Date (November, February, and May), zone (upwelling, downwelling), and depth (10 cm, 50 cm into the bed) were significant main effects on bacterial variables. Biomass and production were significantly higher in May than during November and February, and generally higher at the 10 cm depth than at the 50 cm depth. Activity was higher in the downwelling zone in November followed by a minor peak in May. Production in the downwelling zone in May was 10-fold that of the upwelling zone. Response by bacteria to DOC enrichments (glucose, humic acid) was inconsistent and statistically insignificant. However, some general trends emerged which were consistent with observations for unenriched sediments. Bacterial activity increased with DOC enrichment only in the downwelling zone during November and May. Bacterial production in the downwelling zone increased with DOC enrichment only during November. Hyporheic bacterial patterns reflected generally higher metabolic activities (electron transport activity, thymidine uptake into DNA) within the downwelling zone, a region of greater surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange within the streambed and presumably higher DOC quality from surface-derived labile sources.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1996UU08400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBacterial%2Bbiomass%252C%2Bactivity%252C%2Band%2Bproduction%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bnorth-temperate%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DSP%26rft.auinit%3DSP%26rft.aulast%3DHendricks%26rft.date%3D1996%26rft.epage%3D487%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D467-487%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D467%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D136&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER,SURFACE-WATER,SUBSURFACE SEDIMENTS,RIVER,GROUNDWATER,TRANSPORT,EXCHANGE,PATTERNS,GROWTH,VARIABLES",,"MURRAY STATE UNIV,HANCOCK BIOL STN,ROUTE 3,BOX 288M,MURRAY,KY 42071, USA"

We report on research on the development of aquatic states for temporary streams in the Evrotas basin, Greece. The SIMGRO regional hydrological model was used in a GIS framework to generate flow time series for the Evrotas River and all major tributaries. Five flow phases were distinguished: flood conditions, riffles, connected pools, isolated pools and dry bed conditions. Thresholds based on local hydraulic characteristics were identified per stream reach and flow phase, enabling the frequency of flow phases per month and the average frequencies for all streams to be derived. Three historical scenarios within the 20th century, marking periods of major changes in water management, were investigated. Additionally, a climate scenario for the 2050s was analysed. Simulations revealed that low flows are now much lower, mainly because more groundwater is abstracted for irrigation. The consequence is that stretches of the river fall dry during several months, causing the ecological status to deteriorate.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000368714200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSimulating%2Bstreamflow%2Bvariability%2Band%2Baquatic%2Bstates%2Bin%2Btemporary%2Bstreams%2Busing%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DE.%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DEP%26rft.aulast%3DQuerner%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F02626667.2014.983514%26rft.eissn%3D2150-3435%26rft.epage%3D161%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0262-6667%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BSCIENCES%2BJOURNAL-JOURNAL%2BDES%2BSCIENCES%2BHYDROLOGIQUES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D146-161%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D146%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROLOG%2BSCI%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D61%26rft.au%3DQuerner%252C%2BEP%26rft.au%3DFroebrich%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DTzoraki%252C%2BO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+SCIENCES+JOURNAL-JOURNAL+DES+SCIENCES+HYDROLOGIQUES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/02626667.2014.983514,"aquatic community,temporary streams,flow phases,pools,river basin,SIMGRO model,Greece","RIVER,DROUGHT,REGIMES,CLASSIFICATION,SYSTEM,SIMGRO,BASIN",,"Wageningen Univ & Res, Alterra, Wageningen, Netherlands"

In general, nitrogen surface-groundwater exchanges and processes at the hyporheic scale are difficult to monitor. In order to have a better understanding about these interactions, it is proposed to use stable isotopes (N-15-NO3-, O-18-NO3-, N-15-NH4+) as environmental tracers to identify the sources and fate of the nitrogen compounds in groundwater in the Sagittario River basin, central Italy. The detrimental effect of the groundwater ammonium on the meiofaunal organisms is also evaluated in the hyporheic zone, where N-NH4+ concentrations reach a maximum value of 0.6 mg L-1. The main source of the nitrogen contamination originates from agricultural and urban activities at the catchment scale. The nitrogen compounds reach the gaining stretches of the hyporheic zone along the streambed as nitrate associated to a shallow flow system and ammonium related to a deep flow system. delta N-15 data demonstrate that sewage and fertilizers including manure are the main sources of NO3- and NH4+, the latter being the major pollutant in the study area. delta O-18-NO3- data are consistent with the nitrification of ammonium to nitrate, along with the contribution from inorganic fertilizers. Furthermore, delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- data reveal that denitrification does not play any role on nitrate attenuation in the shallow aquifer and near the discharge areas to the river. The meiofaunal communities, represented by the Crustacea Copepoda selected as the target group, were shown to be sensitive to the high concentration of ammonium found at several hyporheic sites. The statistical analyses indicated a significant reduction of species abundance in the sites polluted by N-NH4+ concentrations > 0.0653 mg L-1.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000402947600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluation%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bsources%2Bof%2Bnitrogen%2Bcompounds%2Band%2Btheir%2Binfluence%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bbiological%2Bcommunities%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bthe%2BSagittario%2BRiver%252C%2BItaly%253A%2Ban%2Bisotopic%2Band%2Bbiological%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DMartachiara%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DCaschetto%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3301%252FIJG.2016.07%26rft.eissn%3D2038-1727%26rft.epage%3D156%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2038-1719%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DITALIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D145-156%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D145%26rft.stitle%3DITAL%2BJ%2BGEOSCI%26rft.volume%3D136%26rft.au%3DCaschetto%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DGalassi%252C%2BDMP%26rft.au%3DAravena%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=ITALIAN+JOURNAL+OF+GEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3301/IJG.2016.07,"groundwater dependent ecosystem,contaminant transport,nitrogen cycle,stable isotopes,hyporheic zone","GROUND-WATER,FRESH-WATER,NATURAL DENITRIFICATION,NITRATE CONTAMINATION,SURFACE-WATER,OGLIO RIVER,FATE,AQUIFER,ORIGIN,OXYGEN",,"Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Ple Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy"

Flowing surface water and pumped pore fluids were characterized by prokaryotic community structure, metabolic potential, and aqueous physicochemistry. Concentrations of potential respiratory electron acceptors were highest in surface water and riverbed porewater and sequentially depleted in porewaters along the inferred flowpath (O-2, then NO3-, then SO42-). Correspondingly, cultivable nitrate reducers/denitrifiers were most abundant in surface water and riverbed porewater, despite oxic conditions. Cultivable sulfate reducers were overall most abundant in surface water. Prokaryotic community reconstruction from 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that the surface water community was less diverse than that of porewater and supports a shift in metabolic strategy, from aerobic heterotrophy in surface water (e.g., Comamonadaceae and Sporichthyaceae) to chemolithotrophy and anaerobic metabolisms (e.g., Hydrogenophaga spp., Ferribacterium spp., Methanobacterium spp.) along the hyporheic flow path.

7,7,"Hogsett, M",Oct 1 2013 ,Dissolved Oxygen Dynamics at the Sediment-Water Column Interface in an Urbanized Stream,ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE,"This manuscript reports findings on sediment oxygen demand (SOD), gross primary production (GPP), net daily metabolism (NDM), and stream reaeration in an urbanized stream, the Jordan River, in Utah. The river has two segments; the Lower Jordan River, which is impaired for dissolved oxygen (DO) and the Upper Jordan River, which is fast flowing with coarse sediments and has no DO impairment. Summer SOD values for the Lower Jordan River ranged from a high 2.2g DO/m(2) per day to a low of 0.97g DO/m(2) per day with most of the sampled sites in the Lower Jordan River having SOD values greater than 1g DO/m(2) per day. SOD values correlated well with volatile solids in surface sediments of the Lower Jordan River. The Upper Jordan River showed SOD values as high as 3.0g DO/m(2) per day, which was attributed to hyporheic exchanges or groundwater upwelling. All sampled sites exhibited high SOD values in winter. A modified chamber method was employed to estimate community respiration (CR24), GPP, and NDM, while characterizing both the water column and benthos. In summer 2010, the sediment tray primary production (TPP) ranged from 1.0 to 7.4g DO/m(2) per day. In winter 2011, TPP ranged from 0.7g DO/m(2) per day to a high value of 5.6g DO/m(2) per day. NDM values indicated that the Upper Jordan River is a year round source of in-stream produced organic matter to the downstream Lower Jordan River with the majority of organic matter produced in the benthos. Reaeration measurements showed that the potential for reaeration is much higher in the mid-sections of the Jordan River, where the river has increased flow velocities due to topography, decreased depths, and a less uniform bottom.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000325689400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDissolved%2BOxygen%2BDynamics%2Bat%2Bthe%2BSediment-Water%2BColumn%2BInterface%2Bin%2Ban%2BUrbanized%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DMitch%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DHogsett%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1089%252Fees.2012.0467%26rft.eissn%3D1557-9018%26rft.epage%3D605%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1092-8758%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BENGINEERING%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D594-605%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D594%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BENG%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D30%26rft.au%3DHogsett%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DGoel%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+ENGINEERING+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1089/ees.2012.0467,"gross primary production,hyporheic exchanges,net daily metabolism,organic carbon,reaeration,sediment oxygen demand,urbanization","COMMUNITY METABOLISM,REAERATION,DEMAND,RIVER,RESPIRATION",,"Univ Utah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 110 S Cent Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA"

This upwelling water had a dissolved solids content (i.e., specific conductance) indicative of river water and was presumed to have entered highly permeable riverbed substrate at locations upstream of the spawning areas. Hyporheic discharge zones composed of undiluted ground water or areas with little or no upwelling were not used by spawning salmon. Rates of upwelling into spawning areas averaged 1200 L.m(-2).day(-1) (95% CI = 784-1665 L.m(-2).day(-1)) as compared with approximately 500 L.m(-2).day(-1) (95% CI = 303-1159 L.m(-2).day(-1)) in nonspawning areas. Dissolved oxygen content of the hyporheic discharge near salmon spawning areas was about 9 mg.L-1 (+/- 0.4 mg.L-1) whereas in nonspawning areas, dissolved oxygen values were 7 mg.L-1 (+/- 0.9 mg.L-1) or lower. In both cases, dissolved oxygen of the river water was higher (11.3 +/- 0.3 mg.L-1). Physical and chemical gradients between the hyporheic zone and the river may provide cues for adult salmon to locate suitable spawning areas. This information will help fisheries managers to describe the suitability of salmon spawning habitat in large rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000088273200012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bdischarge%2Bof%2Briver%2Bwater%2Binto%2Bfall%2Bchinook%2Bsalmon%2B%2528Oncorhynchus%2Btshawytscha%2529%2Bspawning%2Bareas%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHanford%2BReach%252C%2BColumbia%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DDR%26rft.auinit%3DDR%26rft.aulast%3DGeist%26rft.date%3D2000%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252Fcjfas-57-8-1647%26rft.epage%3D1656%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1647-1656%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1647%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D57&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1139/cjfas-57-8-1647,,"TROUT SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS,REDD-SITE SELECTION,BROOK TROUT,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,HABITAT",,"Pacific NW Lab, Ecol Grp, POB 999,MS K6-85, Richland, WA 99352 USA"

We executed a series of laboratory flume experiments to study the coupled stream-subsurface exchange of hematite and the sorbing solutes zinc, copper, and phosphate. A fundamental process-based transport model was applied to analyze the experimental results. We found that hematite had a significant effect on the transport of all ions tested. In addition, hematite mobility was substantially modified by the presence of these solutes. Batch and column experiments showed that the difference in hematite mobility was a direct effect of zinc, copper, and phosphate sorption to the hematite surface. Sorption substantially modified the hematite surface charge and subsequently hematite filtration behavior. These results suggest that the behavior of contaminants cannot be analyzed separately from colloids in surface and groundwater systems because surface-chemical processes can cause their behavior to be coupled. In particular, our results show that general and specific interactions between contaminants and iron oxide particles can alter colloid mobility, perturb natural fine particle dynamics, and either favor or disfavor contaminant mobility.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000231723800019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Bstream-subsurface%2Bexchange%2Bof%2Bcolloidal%2Bhematite%2Band%2Bdissolved%2Bzinc%252C%2Bcopper%252C%2Band%2Bphosphate%26rft.aufirst%3DJH%26rft.auinit%3DJH%26rft.aulast%3DRen%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes050168q%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D6394%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D17%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6387-6394%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6387%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DRen%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/es050168q,,"ACID-MINE DRAINAGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,METAL TRANSPORT,HYPORHEIC ZONE,ADSORPTION,WATER,COAGULATION,CREEK",,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, MSC 213, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA"
10,10,"Huang, P",Sep 2022 ,HyporhPic Exchange in a Meandering Pool-Riffle Stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Interactions among stream characteristics, hyporheic exchange (HE), and groundwater flow are a crucial control for physicochemical and biological reactions in hyporheic zone (HZ). Many previous studies solely investigated the HE induced by pool-riffle bedforms or meanders but few research studied the interactions between them despite this pair of morphology generally coexisting in natural streams. Adopting similar laboratory and numerical methods as Huang and Chui (2021), https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029182 whose pool-riffle streams were straight, this study adequately studied the impacts of hydraulic and morphologic factors on the HE in meandering pool-riffle streams and highlighted the mutual influence among various factors such as bedform amplitude and sinuosity. The results show that meanders significantly complicate the three-dimensional hyporheic flow paths and increase the flowrate and scale of HE. The HE flowrate increases linearly with discharge, bed slope, and sinuosity. The total HZ volume and maximum lateral and vertical extents of HZ generally increase with discharge. They also increase with bed slope and sinuosity but only up to a particular threshold, and they remain nearly constant or slightly decrease after exceeding the threshold. All HE characteristics exponentially decrease with both losing and gaining groundwater flow, and losing conditions have less significant effects on the HE compared with gaining conditions. The HE in stream bank can be larger than that in streambed, and the former is generally more influenced by discharge and sinuosity than the latter. Effects of bedform amplitude on HE exhibit very complex patterns due to the mutual influence of key factors.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000855137600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR031418%26rft.atitle%3DHyporhPic%2BExchange%2Bin%2Ba%2BMeandering%2BPool-Riffle%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DPeng%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DHuang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR031418%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DChui%252C%2BTFM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021WR031418,,"NONSORBING SOLUTES,RIVERS,WATER,MODEL,FLOW",,"Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China"
11,11,"Gerecht, KE",Mar 22 2011 ,Dynamics of hyporheic flow and heat transport across a bed-to-bank continuum in a large regulated river,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The lower Colorado River (LCR) near Austin, Texas is heavily regulated for hydropower generation. Daily water releases from a dam located 23 km upstream of our study site in the LCR caused the stage to fluctuate by more than 1.5 m about a mean depth of 1.3 m. As a result, the river switches from gaining to losing over a dam storage-release cycle, driving exchange between river water and groundwater. We assessed the hydrologic impacts of this by simultaneous temperature and head monitoring across a bed-to-bank transect. River-groundwater exchange flux is largest close to the bank and decreases away from the bank. Correspondingly, both the depth of the hyporheic zone and the exchange time are largest close to the bank. Adjacent to the bank, the streambed head response is hysteretic, with the hysteresis disappearing with distance from the bank, indicating that transient bank storage affects the magnitude and direction of vertical exchange close to the bank. Pronounced changes in streambed temperature are observed down to a meter. When the river stage is high, which coincides with when the river is coldest, downward advection of heat from a previous cycles' warm-water pulse warms the streambed. When the river is at its lowest stage but warmest temperature, upwelling groundwater cools the streambed. Future research should consider and focus on a more thorough understanding of the impacts of dam regulation on the hydrologic, thermal, biogeochemical, and ecologic dynamics of rivers and their hyporheic and riparian zones.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000288874600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW03524%26rft.atitle%3DDynamics%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Band%2Bheat%2Btransport%2Bacross%2Ba%2Bbed-to-bank%2Bcontinuum%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bregulated%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DKatelyn%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DKE%26rft.aulast%3DGerecht%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR009794%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DGerecht%252C%2BKE%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DSwanson%252C%2BTE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2010WR009794,,"WATER-TABLE,EXCHANGE,STREAM,ZONE,DISCHARGE,FLUCTUATIONS,TEMPERATURES,ECOSYSTEMS,QUALITY,TIDE",,"Smith Coll, Picker Engn Program, Northampton, MA 01063 USA"

This study focuses on streambed groundwater chemistry during a period of drought-induced river drying and consequent disconnection between surface water and groundwater. Shallow groundwater underlying vegetated and bare portions of a braided streambed in the Platte River (Nebraska, USA) was monitored during drought conditions in summer 2012. Water temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon (dominated by HCO3-) in streambed groundwater were correlated over a 3month period coinciding with a decline in river discharge from 35 to 0m(3)s(-1). Physical, chemical, and isotopic parameters were monitored to investigate mechanisms affecting the HCO3- trend. Equilibrium thermodynamic modeling suggests that an increase of pCO(2) near the water table, coupled with carbonate mineral weathering, can explain the trend. Stronger temporal trends in Ca2+ and Mg2+ compared to Cl- are consistent with carbonate mineral reequilibria rather than evaporative concentration as the primary mechanism of the increased HCO3-. Stable isotope trends are not apparent, providing further evidence of thermodynamic controls rather than evaporation from the water table. A combination of increased temperature and O-2 in the dewatered portion of the streambed is the most likely driver of increased pCO(2) near the water table. Results of this study highlight potential linkages between surface environmental changes and groundwater chemistry and underscore the need for high-resolution chemical monitoring of alluvial groundwater in order to identify environmental change impacts.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000356523000008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTemporal%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2Bgroundwater-dissolved%2Binorganic%2Bcarbon%2Bbeneath%2Ba%2Bdrought-affected%2Bbraided%2Bstream%253A%2BPlatte%2BRiver%2Bcase%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DAudrey%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DAR%26rft.aulast%3DBoerner%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015JG002950%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D937%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D924-937%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D924%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D120%26rft.au%3DBoerner%252C%2BAR%26rft.au%3DGates%252C%2BJB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015JG002950,"Platte River,stream islands,drought,carbon cycling,soil CO2,hyporheic zone","ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION,CALCITE SUPERSATURATION,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE,SHALLOW GROUNDWATER,SOIL RESPIRATION,KONZA PRAIRIE,DIOXIDE,CO2,PRECIPITATION,PATTERNS",,"Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA"
13,13,"Qi, JY",Dec 2021 ,Coupling terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes for improving stream temperature modeling at the watershed scale,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Water temperature is an important indicator of the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and influences numerous biological and chemical processes that affect water quality, the health and productivity of biota, and other ecosystem services. In this study, we improved the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of various terrestrial water components (i.e., surface runoff, lateral flow, and base flow) and the heat balance of water in streams. The improved SWAT model with an explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes (SWAT-HB) was compared with previous versions of the SWAT model that employ only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature (SWAT-ER) or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water (SWAT-EH) for the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Greensboro Watershed (GW) in the United States. The results show that, even though the SWAT-HB better simulates terrestrial thermal processes, all three models produce comparable simulations of long-term stream temperatures, indicating that stream temperature is mainly influenced by air temperature as water travels along large rivers. Nevertheless, the SWAT-HB and SWAT-EH models achieved better performance than the SWAT-ER model in the winter and spring but exhibited mixed performance in the summer and fall. The better model performance of the SWAT-HB model than the SWAT-EH model can be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperature components. Although, empirical methods (e.g., SWAT-ER) are suitable for providing estimation of stream temperature, the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance-based methods (e.g., SWAT-HB) allow for the consideration of land and water management practices (e.g. crop irrigation, land use change, and water use for thermoelectric cooling) effects on stream temperature.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000706318300058,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B126983%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bterrestrial%2Band%2Baquatic%2Bthermal%2Bprocesses%2Bfor%2Bimproving%2Bstream%2Btemperature%2Bmodeling%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bwatershed%2Bscale%26rft.aufirst%3DJunyu%26rft.auinit%3DJY%26rft.aulast%3DQi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2021.126983%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.part%3DB%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D603%26rft.au%3DQi%252C%2BJY%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BXS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126983,"Heat balance,Stream temperature,Watershed modeling,Upper Mississippi River","CLIMATE-CHANGE,LAND-USE,ASSESSMENT-TOOL,POTENTIAL IMPACTS,SOIL-TEMPERATURE,RIVER-BASIN,CALIBRATION,OPTIMIZATION,ALGORITHMS,SIMULATION",,"ARS, USDA, Hydrol & Remote Sensing Lab, Beltsville, MD 20705 USA"
14,14,"Pennington, R",Jun 2018 ,Measurement of gas-exchange rate in streams by the oxygen-carbon method,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"The gas-exchange rate between streams and the atmosphere is needed to measure in-stream ecological processes and C processing in rivers and streams. Current methods include empirical relationships to hydraulics, direct injection of a tracer gas, and modeling based on O-2 or C diel curves. All existing methods have strengths and drawbacks and most are limited to point measurements or are unable to measure diel variation in exchange rate. Researchers continue to search for better techniques, particularly for steep streams with high rates of gas exchange and low primary productivity. We present the O-2-C (OC) method for calculating gas-exchange rates via simultaneous measurement of O-2 and dissolved inorganic C (DIC). Gas-exchange rates are calculated by solving the combined stream transport equation for O-2 and DIC. The output is a time-series of aeration rates at the same sampling frequency as the input O-2 and C data. Field tests in a 4th-order montane stream in Oregon, USA, indicate that the method is suitable for stream reaches with high downstream gas-concentration gradients and saturation deficits. The mean modeled aeration rate adjusted to 17 degrees C (3.25/h) agreed well with the value of 3.22/h from direct gas injection. Net ecosystem production calculated with the modeled aeration rate (-1.69 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) was consistent with the result obtained with direct gas injection (-1.60 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). An assumption of the model is a constant respiration quotient, but results indicated that the respiration quotient may be time variable. Sensitivity analysis indicated that application of the OC method is limited to reaches with a suitable change in combined O-2 and CO2 concentration >= similar to 4 mu mol/L and combined O-2 and CO2 saturation deficits approximate to 4 mu mol/L, characteristic of smaller gaining streams. Preliminary application of the OC method indicates it could be useful to practitioners interested in continuous measurement of gas-exchange rates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000432253900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMeasurement%2Bof%2Bgas-exchange%2Brate%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Bby%2Bthe%2Boxygen-carbon%2Bmethod%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DPennington%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F698018%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D237%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D222-237%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D222%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D37%26rft.au%3DPennington%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DArgerich%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DHaggerty%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/698018,"stream metabolism,aeration rate,gas transfer,efflux,evasion,stream carbon flux,community respiration,submersible CO2 sensor","TRAVERTINE-DEPOSITING STREAM,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,DISSOLVED CARBON,MASS-BALANCE,REAERATION,DIOXIDE,PRODUCTIVITY,RESPIRATION,WATER,RIVER",,"Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA"
15,15,"Phogat, V",Oct 2017 ,Long-Term Quantification of Stream-Aquifer Exchange in a Variably-Saturated Heterogeneous Environment,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"A variably-saturated finite element model HYDRUS-2D was used to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of stream-aquifer exchange for a perennial stream flowing through an undulating catchment and underlain by heterogeneous geology. The model was first calibrated and validated using piezometric heads measured near the stream. The model was then used a) to quantify the long-term dynamics of exchange at stream-aquifer interface and the water balance in the domain, and b) to evaluate the impact of anisotropy of geological materials, thickness (w) and hydraulic conductivity (K-s ) of the low permeability layer at the streambed, and water table fluctuations on the extent of exchange. Simulated pressure heads in the domain revealed that seasonal groundwater fluctuations were more pronounced near the stream. Daily discharge to the stream varied from 0.05 to 0.3 mm/day, annual discharge ranged from 59 to 74 mm, and the overall water balance showed a discharge (-54 mm) from the domain during 2000-2012. A five-fold increase in K (s) of the low permeability layer enhanced discharge to the stream by 14% (10 mm/year) whereas an increase in the thickness of the layer by 1 m had a low impact (2.4 mm/year). A 2-m drawdown of the water table transformed a connected and gaining system into a losing, disconnected system. These results suggest that depletion of groundwater due to climate change or excessive pumping could have a pronounced impact on the availability of water resources and sustainability of the existing water-dependent ecosystem.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000411869000020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLong-Term%2BQuantification%2Bof%2BStream-Aquifer%2BExchange%2Bin%2Ba%2BVariably-Saturated%2BHeterogeneous%2BEnvironment%26rft.aufirst%3DV.%26rft.auinit%3DV%26rft.aulast%3DPhogat%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-017-1752-0%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1650%26rft.epage%3D4366%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4353-4366%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4353%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DPhogat%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DPotter%252C%2BNJ%26rft.au%3DSimunek%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11269-017-1752-0,"Stream-aquifer exchange,HYDRUS-2D,Low permeability layer,Anisotropy,Groundwater","SURFACE-WATER,MODEL,GROUNDWATER,FLOW,VEGETATION,AUSTRALIA,INFILTRATION,TRANSPORT,SOILS",,"South Australian Res & Dev Inst, GPO Box 397, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia"
16,16,"Harvey, JW",Oct 9 2012 ,Hydrogeomorphology of the hyporheic zone: Stream solute and fine particle interactions with a dynamic streambed,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Hyporheic flow in streams has typically been studied separately from geomorphic processes. We investigated interactions between bed mobility and dynamic hyporheic storage of solutes and fine particles in a sand-bed stream before, during, and after a flood. A conservatively transported solute tracer (bromide) and a fine particles tracer (5 mu m latex particles), a surrogate for fine particulate organic matter, were co-injected during base flow. The tracers were differentially stored, with fine particles penetrating more shallowly in hyporheic flow and retained more efficiently due to the high rate of particle filtration in bed sediment compared to solute. Tracer injections lasted 3.5 h after which we released a small flood from an upstream dam one hour later. Due to shallower storage in the bed, fine particles were rapidly entrained during the rising limb of the flood hydrograph. Rather than being flushed by the flood, we observed that solutes were stored longer due to expansion of hyporheic flow paths beneath the temporarily enlarged bedforms. Three important timescales determined the fate of solutes and fine particles: (1) flood duration, (2) relaxation time of flood-enlarged bedforms back to base flow dimensions, and (3) resulting adjustments and lag times of hyporheic flow. Recurrent transitions between these timescales explain why we observed a peak accumulation of natural particulate organic matter between 2 and 4 cm deep in the bed, i.e., below the scour layer of mobile bedforms but above the maximum depth of particle filtration in hyporheic flow paths. Thus, physical interactions between bed mobility and hyporheic transport influence how organic matter is stored in the bed and how long it is retained, which affects decomposition rate and metabolism of this southeastern Coastal Plain stream. In summary we found that dynamic interactions between hyporheic flow, bed mobility, and flow variation had strong but differential influences on base flow retention and flood mobilization of solutes and fine particulates. These hydrogeomorphic relationships have implications for microbial respiration of organic matter, carbon and nutrient cycling, and fate of contaminants in streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309839000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG00N11%26rft.atitle%3DHydrogeomorphology%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%253A%2BStream%2Bsolute%2Band%2Bfine%2Bparticle%2Binteractions%2Bwith%2Ba%2Bdynamic%2Bstreambed%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DJW%26rft.aulast%3DHarvey%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2012JG002043%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D117%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DTobias%252C%2BCR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2012JG002043,,"PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER,SEDIMENT-TRANSPORT,TRANSIENT STORAGE,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,NUTRIENT-UPTAKE,DEPOSITION,SAND,SIZE,RESTORATION,VELOCITY",,"US Geol Survey, Natl Res Program, Natl Ctr 430, Reston, VA 20192 USA"
17,17,"Su, XR",Nov 2020 ,Scale issues and the effects of heterogeneity on the dune-induced hyporheic mixing,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hyporheic mixing plays a vital role in physical, biogeochemical, and thermal processes in river networks. While many studies have emphasized the role of streambed heterogeneity in hyporheic mixing processes, this study articulates the scale issues inherent in concentration, mixing, heterogeneity, and modeling approaches. It subsequently conducted simulations of hyporheic mixing in synthetic, heterogeneous, 2-D cross-sectional river beds based on prescribed hydraulic conductivity defined at the local-scale. It then investigated the flux variation distribution and the mixing zone under different degrees of heterogeneity and flow scenarios. Since the characterization of the heterogeneities in detail at the local scale is practically impossible, Monte Carlo simulation based on stochastic theory was used to demonstrate the hyporheic mixing under the large-scale control volume (macromixing). Afterward, a first-order stochastic analysis was undertaken to explore the relationship between local-scale flux variance distribution and the mixing zone under different heterogeneity and flow scenarios. The results of this study show that the flux variance in the streambed is an appropriate metric for assessing the magnitude of hyporheic mixing at all scales. Further, surface water velocity and upwelling groundwater are found to be the dominant controlling factors of the flux variance and in turn, the mixing process, followed by the streambed heterogeneity. In addition, it demonstrates that the hyporheic mixing process is significantly affected by the complex surface and groundwater circulation regimes and the stagnation zone under steady-state flow conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000599754500148,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B125429%26rft.atitle%3DScale%2Bissues%2Band%2Bthe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bheterogeneity%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bdune-induced%2Bhyporheic%2Bmixing%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaoru%26rft.auinit%3DXR%26rft.aulast%3DSu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.125429%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D590%26rft.au%3DSu%252C%2BXR%26rft.au%3DYeh%252C%2BTCJ%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BCP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125429,"Hyporheic mixing,Scales,Uncertainty,Heterogeneity,First-order analysis,Flux variance","NONSORBING SOLUTES,BED FORMS,STREAMBED HETEROGENEITY,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,EXCHANGE,TRANSPORT,FLOW,IMPACT,WATER,FIELD",,"Tianjin Normal Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Water Environm & Resources, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China"
18,18,"Smidt, SJ",Nov-dec 2015 ,A Comparison of Hyporheic Transport at a Cross-Vane Structure and Natural Riffle,GROUNDWATER,"While restoring hyporheic flowpaths has been cited as a benefit to stream restoration structures, little documentation exists confirming that constructed restoration structures induce comparable hyporheic exchange to natural stream features. This study compares a stream restoration structure (cross-vane) to a natural feature (riffle) concurrently in the same stream reach using time-lapsed electrical resistivity (ER) tomography. Using this hydrogeophysical approach, we were able to quantify hyporheic extent and transport beneath the cross-vane structure and the riffle. We interpret from the geophysical data that the cross-vane and the natural riffle induced spatially and temporally unique hyporheic extent and transport, and the cross-vane created both spatially larger and temporally longer hyporheic flowpaths than the natural riffle. Tracer from the 4.67-h injection was detected along flowpaths for 4.6 h at the cross-vane and 4.2 h at the riffle. The spatial extent of the hyporheic zone at the cross-vane was 12% larger than that at the riffle. We compare ER results of this study to vertical fluxes calculated from temperature profiles and conclude significant differences in the interpretation of hyporheic transport from these different field techniques. Results of this study demonstrate a high degree of heterogeneity in transport metrics at both the cross-vane and the riffle and differences between the hyporheic flowpath networks at the two different features. Our results suggest that restoration structures may be capable of creating sufficient exchange flux and timescales of transport to achieve the same ecological functions as natural features, but engineering of the physical and biogeochemical environment may be necessary to realize these benefits.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000363894200007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BComparison%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BTransport%2Bat%2Ba%2BCross-Vane%2BStructure%2Band%2BNatural%2BRiffle%26rft.aufirst%3DSamuel%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DSJ%26rft.aulast%3DSmidt%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12288%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D871%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D859-871%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D859%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DSmidt%252C%2BSJ%26rft.au%3DCullin%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BTA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gwat.12288,,"SOLUTE TRANSPORT,EXCHANGE FLOW,RIVER RESTORATION,STREAM,ZONE,WATER,RESISTIVITY,PATTERNS,ERT,TEMPERATURES",,"Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 430 MSB 2, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA"
19,19,"Leach, JA",Jun 2021 ,Lake Outflow and Hillslope Lateral Inflows Dictate Thermal Regimes of Forested Streams Draining Small Lakes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Empirical studies have highlighted the important influence of lakes on stream temperature at landscape scales, even when lakes comprise just a small fraction of the catchment area. However, only a few studies have focused on the hydrologic and thermal processes underpinning these landscape patterns. We collected detailed field measurements at a boreal stream that drains a headwater lake and used these data within a process-based stream temperature model to, (a) document the downstream extent of lake influences at both seasonal and event-based timescales, (b) assess the hydrologic and thermal processes that control the observed downstream variability, and (c) compare downstream temperature for streams with and without a headwater lake. Summer and autumn lake outlet temperatures were elevated compared to hillslope lateral inflow temperatures. During periods of low lake outflow, stream temperatures decreased rapidly downstream as local energy fluxes, primarily lateral inflows from the hillslopes and hyporheic exchange, overwhelmed the lake effects. The lake influence on downstream temperature was the greatest during periods of high lake outflow and persisted at least 1.4 km downstream. Since lakes can moderate and delay upstream rainfall runoff response, periods of high lake outflow and high hillslope inflow rates were generally out-of-phase. This difference in timing of warm lake outlet and cool hillslope water creates a dynamic thermal environment downstream of the small lake. Such lakes are ubiquitous in northern landscapes, and accounting for the competing influence of lake and hillslope contributions on downstream water temperature is critical for predicting how network-scale thermal regimes will respond to environmental change.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000667245100019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028136%26rft.atitle%3DLake%2BOutflow%2Band%2BHillslope%2BLateral%2BInflows%2BDictate%2BThermal%2BRegimes%2Bof%2BForested%2BStreams%2BDraining%2BSmall%2BLakes%26rft.aufirst%3DJason%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DJA%26rft.aulast%3DLeach%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028136%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DLeach%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DNeilson%252C%2BBT%26rft.au%3DLaudon%252C%2BH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR028136,"energy balance,forest hydrology,hyporheic,lake-stream,lateral inflow,stream temperature","WATER TEMPERATURE,BRITISH-COLUMBIA,CLIMATE-CHANGE,INCORPORATING LAKES,HEADWATER STREAMS,ENERGY-BALANCE,RAINBOW-TROUT,BOREAL LAKE,CLEAR-CUT,RIVER",,"Canadian Forest Serv, Nat Resources Canada, Great Lakes Forestry Ctr, Sault Ste Marie, ON, Canada"

We show that the hydraulic conductivity of shallow alluvial aquifers subject to sinuosity-driven hyporheic flow is dynamic because of transport of fine materials. We analyze changes in hydraulic conductivity over one year at a meander-scale experimental river-aquifer system using water table monitoring, repeat in-situ hydraulic tests, grain size analysis, and flow modeling with particle tracking. Areas with relatively high initial hydraulic conductivity became more permeable after one year, while areas with lower initial hydraulic conductivity became less permeable. Particle tracking suggests fine materials were flushed from the more permeable portions of the aquifer and deposited in the less permeable areas down-gradient. Since hydraulic conductivity evolution has feedback on flow, static or synoptic hydraulic conductivity measurements in river-hyporheic-riparian systems may need to be revisited. Temporally changing hydraulic conductivity has the capacity to impact rates of ecological and biogeochemical processes. Citation: Nowinski, J. D., M. B. Cardenas, and A. F.

21,21,"Malard, F",Jul 2001 ,Thermal heterogeneity in the hyporheic zone of a glacial floodplain,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"We examined the thermal regime of surface and hyporheic waters at three kryal sites and four krenal streams within the channel network of a glacial floodplain. Temperature was continuously measured for 1 year in the surface stream and at sediment depths of 30 and 80 cm. The vertical pattern of water temperature was strongly influenced by the direction and intensity of surface water - groundwater exchanges. At sites characterized by strong downwelling of surface waters, the thermal regimes of surface and hyporheic waters were virtually identical. In contrast, inputs of groundwater substantially increased mean summer temperatures in the hyporheic zone of the main kryal channel, decreased summer temperatures in the hyporheic zone of krenal streams, and elevated hyporheic temperatures of all stream types during winter. Groundwater from different sources had dramatically different effects on the seasonal regime of temperature in the hyporheic zone. Inflow of shallow alluvial groundwater had minimal effects on seasonal patterns of hyporheic temperature, whereas upwelling from deep alluvial and hillslope aquifers resulted in significant time lags and differences in seasonal amplitudes between surface and hyporheic temperatures. The unexpectedly high thermal heterogeneity of hyporheic waters presumably sustains biodiversity and stimulates ecosystem processes in this glacial floodplain.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000169776600006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThermal%2Bheterogeneity%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bglacial%2Bfloodplain%26rft.aufirst%3DF%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DMalard%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252Fcjfas-58-7-1319%26rft.epage%3D1335%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1319-1335%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1319%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DMalard%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DMangin%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BJV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1139/cjfas-58-7-1319,,"TIME-SERIES,TEMPERATURE,STREAM,BENEATH,ECOLOGY,RIVER,WATER,GROUNDWATER,SWITZERLAND,PATTERNS",,"Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5023, 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"
22,22,"Houze, C",Feb 2022 ,Combining experimental and modelling approaches to monitor the transport of an artificial tracer through the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In order to advance methodologies used in the investigation of Hyporheic Zone (HZ) mixing processes, this article combines experimental and modelling tools to follow a tracer injected into the river and infiltrating into the HZ. A highly concentrated sodium chloride solution was injected into the river; (i) the river conductivity, (ii) the riverbed resistivity by Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and (iii) vertically distributed chloride concentrations within the HZ were monitored. Both ERT and concentration measurements showed an infiltration depth of the tracer of 35 cm, and a partial recovery after injection, which was faster within the superficial layer that was found to be more resistive according to the ERT initial image. The modelling approach used the HydroGeoSphere code to model the coupling between river surface flows and HZ groundwater flows and transport processes. The model set-up involved a 50 cm high existing riverbed step, a vertical contrast in HZ saturated hydraulic conductivity and the aquifer discharge flux. Fitting the vertical chloride profile, the adjusted values were 5 x 10(-2) m s(-1) for the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the first highly permeable layer below the riverbed, and 4 x 10(-6) m s(-1) for the aquifer discharge flux. The bottom layer saturated hydraulic conductivity was found to be at least 10 times lower than the value within the first layer. Numerical simulations showed that the two main parameters controlling the mixing within the HZ were the groundwater discharge and the saturated hydraulic conductivity first sediment layer of the riverbed. The riverbed step was found to be less significant here compared to these two parameters. The combination of experimental and modelling tools allowed us to quantify the aquifer discharge flux, which is complicated to investigate in the field without any model. Results of this study showed that combining modelling with ERT and vertically distributed chloride sampling allows the quantification of the main factors controlling the hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000760417000026,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14498%26rft.atitle%3DCombining%2Bexperimental%2Band%2Bmodelling%2Bapproaches%2Bto%2Bmonitor%2Bthe%2Btransport%2Bof%2Ban%2Bartificial%2Btracer%2Bthrough%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DClemence%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DHouze%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14498%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DHouze%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DDurand%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DNous%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14498,"artificial tracer transport,hyporheic zone,modelling,time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)","GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,EXCHANGE FLUXES,WATER EXCHANGE,STREAM,FLOW,INTERFACE,IMPACT",,"Univ Paris Saclay, Lab GEOPS, UMR 8148, CNRS, Bat 504, F-91405 Orsay, France"

Simulation results suggest that continuation of over-extraction of groundwater will gradually increase the depletion volume in the river year after year and more depletion will occur in later years.

Severe or extreme droughts occurred about 10% of the time over a 105-year record from central New Mexico, U.S.A., based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index.2. Drought lowers water tables, creating extensive areas of groundwater recharge and fragmenting reaches of streams and rivers. Deeper groundwater inputs predominate as sources of surface flows during drought. Nutrient inputs to streams and rivers reflect the biogeochemistry of regional ground waters with longer subsurface residence times.3. Inputs of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon to surface waters decrease during drought, with labile carbon limitation of microbial metabolism a byproduct of drought conditions.4. Decreased inputs of organic forms of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus and a decrease in the organic : inorganic ratio of nutrient inputs favours autotrophs over heterotrophs during drought.5. The fate of autotrophic production during drought will be strongly influenced by the structure of the aquatic food web within impacted sites.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000183640900008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Bbiogeochemical%2Band%2Bhydrological%2Bresponses%2Bof%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%2Bto%2Bdrought%26rft.aufirst%3DCN%26rft.auinit%3DCN%26rft.aulast%3DDahm%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.2003.01082.x%26rft.epage%3D1231%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1219-1231%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1219%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DDahm%252C%2BCN%26rft.au%3DBaker%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DThibault%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01082.x,"biogeochemistry,dissolved organic carbon,drought,hydrology,nutrient cycling,surface water/groundwater interactions,water table","DESERT STREAM,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,HEADWATER STREAMS,WATER EXCHANGE,FOREST STREAMS,ORGANIC-CARBON,FOOD WEBS,GROUNDWATER,ECOSYSTEM,RETENTION",,"Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA"
25,25,"Sawyer, AH",Jun 2014 ,Hydrologic dynamics and geochemical responses within a floodplain aquifer and hyporheic zone during Hurricane Sandy,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Storms dominate solute export budgets from catchments and drive hydrogeochemical changes in the near-stream environment. We captured near-stream hydrogeochemical dynamics during an intense storm (Hurricane Sandy, October 2012), by instrumenting a riparian-hyporheic zone transect of White Clay Creek in the Christina River Basin Critical Zone Observatory with pressure transducers, redox probes, and pore water samplers. In the floodplain aquifer, preferential vertical flow paths such as macropores facilitated rapid infiltration early in the storm. Water table rose quickly and promoted continuous groundwater discharge to the stream. Floodplain-hillslope topography controlled poststorm aquifer drainage rates, as the broad, western floodplain aquifer drained more slowly than the narrow, eastern floodplain aquifer adjacent to a steep hillslope. These changes in groundwater flow drove heterogeneous geochemical responses in the floodplain aquifer and hyporheic zone. Vertical infiltration in the floodplain and hyporheic exchange in the streambed increased DOC and oxygen delivery to microbially active sediments, which may have enhanced respiration. Resulting geochemical perturbations persisted from days to weeks after the storm. Our observations suggest that groundwater-borne solute delivery to streams during storms depends on unique interactions of vertical infiltration along preferential pathways, perturbations to groundwater geochemistry, and topographically controlled drainage rates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000340430400019,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrologic%2Bdynamics%2Band%2Bgeochemical%2Bresponses%2Bwithin%2Ba%2Bfloodplain%2Baquifer%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bduring%2BHurricane%2BSandy%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DAH%26rft.aulast%3DSawyer%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR015101%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4892%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4877-4892%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4877%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DKaplan%252C%2BLA%26rft.au%3DMichael%252C%2BHA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013WR015101,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,4TH-ORDER MOUNTAIN STREAM,RIPARIAN ZONE,CAPILLARY-FRINGE,STORM DYNAMICS,HOT MOMENTS,FLOW PATHS,WATER,GROUNDWATER,IRON",,"Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA"
26,26,"Arnon, S",Jan 1 2010 ,"Effects of overlying velocity, particle size, and biofilm growth on stream-subsurface exchange of particles",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream-subsurface exchange strongly influences the transport of contaminants, fine particles, and other ecologically relevant substances in streams. We used a recirculating laboratory flume (220 cm long and 20 cm wide) to study the effects of particle size, overlying velocity, and biofilm formation on stream-subsurface exchange of particles. Sodium chloride was used as a non-reactive dissolved tracer and 1- and 5-mu m fluorescent microspheres were used as particulate tracers. Surface-subsurface exchange was observed with a clean sand bed and a bed colonized by an autotrophic-heterotrophic biofilm under two different overlying velocities, 0.9 and 5 cm s(-1). Hydrodynamic interactions between the overlying flow and sand bed resulted in a reduction of solute and particle concentrations in the water column, and a corresponding accumulation of particles in both the sediments and in the biofilm. Increasing overlying velocity and particle size resulted in faster removal from the overlying water due to enhanced mass transfer to the bed. The presence of the biofilm did not affect solute exchange under any flow condition tested. The presence of the biofilm significantly increased the deposition of particles under an overlying velocity of 5 cm s(-1), and produced a small but statistically insignificant increase at 0.9 cm(-1). The particles preferentially deposited within the biofilm matrix relative to the underlying sand. These results demonstrate that hydrodynamic transport conditions, particle size, and biofilm formation play a key role in the transport of suspended particles, such as inorganic sediments, particulate organic matter, and pathogenic microorganisms in freshwater ecosystems, and should be taken into consideration when predicting the fate and transport of particles and contaminants in the environment.

27,27,"Qiu, H",Feb 2019 ,Evaluating a Coupled Phenology-Surface Energy Balance Model to Understand Stream-Subsurface Temperature Dynamics in a Mixed-Use Farmland Catchment,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream temperature is a key variable that controls both physical and biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. Complex physical interactions between land surface and subsurface processes make accurate simulations of stream temperature dynamics at catchment scales a challenging task. In this study we propose an integrated, catchment-scale framework to model stream, soil, streambed, and groundwater temperatures under the influence of hydrologic and vegetation dynamics in a mixed land use catchment in central England. The phenology and surface energy modules in the coupled model were used to quantify the impacts of vegetation processes on radiation fluxes (e.g., canopy shading and the effect of vegetation growth on optical parameters). The model enabled accurate simulations of the movement and partitioning of water and thermal fluxes in different hydrologic domains with R-2 values of observed and simulated temperatures in the range 0.60-0.87. Simulated groundwater heads and stream stages allowed the identification of gaining and losing portions of stream reaches and the estimation of Darcy fluxes. Simulation results show significantly dampened diel streambed temperature fluctuations below 0.3m in gaining reaches, while in losing reaches the diel fluctuations showed relatively strong fluctuations below 0.3m. The model enabled evaluation of the relative contributions of different processes to the stream thermal budget. Results indicate that net radiation was the dominant heat source, while latent heat flux was the primary heat sink. The model provides a useful tool to explicitly simulate water and heat fluxes as well as temperature-dependent reaction rates in biogeochemical analyses.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000461858900041,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluating%2Ba%2BCoupled%2BPhenology-Surface%2BEnergy%2BBalance%2BModel%2Bto%2BUnderstand%2BStream-Subsurface%2BTemperature%2BDynamics%2Bin%2Ba%2BMixed-Use%2BFarmland%2BCatchment%26rft.aufirst%3DHan%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DQiu%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR023644%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D1697%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1675-1697%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1675%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DQiu%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DBlaen%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DPhanikumar%252C%2BMS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR023644,"catchment hydrology,stream temperature,hyporheic exchange,energy budget,surface-subsurface interactions,groundwater","LAND-SURFACE,WATER TEMPERATURE,THERMAL REGIME,HYDROLOGIC MODEL,HEAT EXCHANGES,GROUNDWATER,VEGETATION,CLIMATE,CANOPY,FOREST",,"Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA"
28,28,"Stead, TK",Jun 2004 ,The contribution of subsurface invertebrates to benthic density and biomass in a gravel stream,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"The interstitial sediments of streams and rivers, the 'hyporheic zone', have a diverse and numerous fauna though the relative contribution of the subsurface and surface assemblages to total productivity remains poorly understood. Our main aim was to determine the contribution of hyporheic invertebrates to overall, reach-scale estimates of density and biomass in an acidic, first order stream in south-east England. We estimated metazoan density across a wide range of body sizes (meiofauna [>42mum to <500mum] and macrofauna [>500mum]) over time. A comparison with the assemblage from the streambed surface indicated that surface samples (0 - 5 cm) alone potentially underestimate annual, reach-scale estimates of density and biomass by factors of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively. An invertebrate assemblage of relatively few, large individuals near the surface was replaced by a suite of numerous but small-bodied organisms in the deeper sediments. Although abundances peaked at different depths in the sediments, most taxa were found throughout the profile. The assemblage of numerous, small-bodied invertebrates in the interstices at this stream may contribute substantially towards overall benthic production.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000222110900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bcontribution%2Bof%2Bsubsurface%2Binvertebrates%2Bto%2Bbenthic%2Bdensity%2Band%2Bbiomass%2Bin%2Ba%2Bgravel%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DTK%26rft.auinit%3DTK%26rft.aulast%3DStead%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F0003-9136%252F2004%252F0160-0171%26rft.epage%3D191%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D171-191%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D171%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D160%26rft.au%3DStead%252C%2BTK%26rft.au%3DSchmid-Araya%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DHildrew%252C%2BAG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0160-0171,"interstitial fauna,hyporheic zone,meiofauna,diversity","HYPORHEIC ZONE,INTERSTITIAL COMMUNITIES,VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,LOTIC DISTURBANCE,SEDIMENTS,ABUNDANCE,DYNAMICS,PATTERNS,EXCHANGE",,"Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, London E1 4NS, England"
29,29,"Garner, G",Mar 15 2015 ,"Inter-annual variability in the effects of riparian woodland on micro-climate, energy exchanges and water temperature of an upland Scottish stream",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The influence of riparian woodland on stream temperature, micro-climate and energy exchange was investigated over seven calendar years. Continuous data were collected from two reaches of the Girnock Burn (a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland) with contrasting land use characteristics: (1) semi-natural riparian forest and (2) open moorland. In the moorland reach, wind speed and energy fluxes (especially net radiation, latent heat and sensible heat) varied considerably between years because of variable riparian micro-climate coupled strongly to prevailing meteorological conditions. In the forested reach, riparian vegetation sheltered the stream from meteorological conditions that produced a moderated micro-climate and thus energy exchange conditions, which were relatively stable between years. Net energy gains (losses) in spring and summer (autumn and winter) were typically greater in the moorland than the forest. However, when particularly high latent heat loss or low net radiation gain occurred in the moorland, net energy gain (loss) was less than that in the forest during the spring and summer (autumn and winter) months. Spring and summer water temperature was typically cooler in the forest and characterised by less inter-annual variability due to reduced, more inter-annually stable energy gain in the forested reach. The effect of riparian vegetation on autumn and winter water temperature dynamics was less clear because of the confounding effects of reach-scale inflows of thermally stable groundwater in the moorland reach, which strongly influenced the local heat budget. These findings provide new insights as to the hydrometeorological conditions under which semi-natural riparian forest may be effective in mitigating river thermal variability, notably peaks, under present and future climates.

30,30,"Davy-Bowker, J",Jun 2006 ,The distribution of benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrates from the heads and tails of riffles,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The spatial distribution of benthic (up to 0.05 m depth) and hyporheic (0.25 and 0.5 m depth) macroinvertebrates from downwelling zones at the heads of riffles and upwelling zones at the tails of riffles was examined in two studies on a 4th order chalk stream in Dorset, England. In the first study, differences in benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate community composition between the head and tail of a single riffle were investigated. In the second study, a replicated design involving eight riffles was used to compare benthic and hyporheic macroinvertebrate community composition both between heads and tails of the same riffles and between riffles. In the first (usingle riffle) study there were significantly higher mean numbers of benthic invertebrates and families at the riffle head (715 individuals and 13.8 families per 0.0225 m 2) compared to the tail (192 individuals and 8.7 families). ANOSIM analysis also showed that the community structure of head and tail benthic samples was significantly different. In the second (replicated riffle) study, there were also significantly more benthic invertebrates at riffle heads ((x) over bar = 594 per 0.0225 m 2) compared to tails ((x) over bar = 417 per 0.0225 m 2), although this was not the case for families, and community structure also differed significantly between riffle heads and tails. In contrast, in the hyporheic zone, there were no significant differences between the total numbers of invertebrates in the riffle heads and tails, or between riffles, although a significant difference in family richness between riffle head and tail samples was identified in the first study. Community analysis revealed progressively poorer separation of riffle head and tail samples at 0.25 m and 0.5 m hyporheic depths. Whilst being able to identify clear differences in benthic communities from riffles heads and tails, the physically heterogeneous nature of the riffle habitats studied made it difficult to account for the consistent differences in macroinvertebrate communities observed with the physical variables measured.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000237552100010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2Bbenthic%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Bmacroinvertebrates%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bheads%2Band%2Btails%2Bof%2Briffles%26rft.aufirst%3DJohn%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DDavy-Bowker%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-005-1482-9%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D123%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D109-123%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D109%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D563%26rft.au%3DDavy-Bowker%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DSweeting%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DArnott%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-005-1482-9,"macroinvertebrates,benthic,hyporheic,riffle,upwelling,downwelling","SONORAN DESERT STREAM,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,SURFACE-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,NORTH-TEMPERATE STREAM,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,INTERSTITIAL WATER,SAMPLE VOLUME,ZONE,RIVER",,"Winfrith Technol Ctr, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Dorchester DT2 8ZD, Dorset, England"
31,31,"Ward, AS",Jan-feb 2013 ,How Does Subsurface Characterization Affect Simulations of Hyporheic Exchange?,GROUND WATER,"We investigated the role of increasingly well-constrained geologic structures in the subsurface (i.e., subsurface architecture) in predicting streambed flux and hyporheic residence time distribution (RTD) for a headwater stream. Five subsurface realizations with increasingly resolved lithological boundaries were simulated in which model geometries were based on increasing information about flow and transport using soil and geologic maps, surface observations, probing to depth to refusal, seismic refraction, electrical resistivity (ER) imaging of subsurface architecture, and time-lapse ER imaging during a solute tracer study. Particle tracking was used to generate RTDs for each model run. We demonstrate how improved characterization of complex lithological boundaries and calibration of porosity and hydraulic conductivity affect model prediction of hyporheic flow and transport. Models using hydraulic conductivity calibrated using transient ER data yield estimates of streambed flux that are three orders of magnitude larger than uncalibrated models using estimated values for hydraulic conductivity based on values published for nearby hillslopes (10-4 vs. 10-7 m2/s, respectively). Median residence times for uncalibrated and calibrated models are 103 and 100 h, respectively. Increasingly well-resolved subsurface architectures yield wider hyporheic RTDs, indicative of more complex hyporheic flowpath networks and potentially important to biogeochemical cycling. The use of ER imaging to monitor solute tracers informs subsurface structure not apparent from other techniques, and helps to define transport properties of the subsurface (i.e., hydraulic conductivity). Results of this study demonstrate the value of geophysical measurements to more realistically simulate flow and transport along hyporheic flowpaths.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000312989000006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2BDoes%2BSubsurface%2BCharacterization%2BAffect%2BSimulations%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1745-6584.2012.00911.x%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D28%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D14-28%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D14%26rft.stitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DSingha%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=GROUND+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.00911.x,,"ELECTRICAL-RESISTIVITY TOMOGRAPHY,SALT-WATER INJECTION,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,GROUNDWATER MODELS,GEOPHYSICAL-DATA,ZONE,FLOW,SURFACE,RESOLUTION,FOREST",,"Univ Iowa, Dept Geosci, 36 Trowbridge Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA"

In this regard, small-scale flow conditions in the hyporheic zone at the interface between surface- and groundwater can be important for process-understanding. This especially includes questions concerning flow conditions in salmonid redds of gravel-bed rivers. The Swiss subalpine river Enziwigger was chosen as an example for a small channelized river with artificial steps within the riverbed. Several methods were developed, tested and combined that capture the four dimensions (three spatial and one temporal) of the interactions between surface water, the hyporheic zone and groundwater, for individual river segments. The setup of a monitoring network as well as the realization of field-measurements provided data for groundwater flow models. Continuous time series of hydraulic data, temperature and electrical conductivity within the river and the riverbed, as well as within the riverine groundwater, allowed identifying zones with significant exchange of surface water and groundwater. Additionally, the data helped describe the transient character of groundwater flow-paths under various hydrological boundary conditions. Results of the field-measurements in combination with transient groundwater flow modeling and scenario analyses illustrate the relevance of dynamically changing infiltration and exfiltration patterns within the riverbed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000323659100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2Bscales%2Bof%2Briver-groundwater%2Binteraction%253A%2Ba%2Bmultidimensional%2Bhydrogeological%2Binvestigation%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DEmanuel%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DHuber%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00767-013-0220-x%26rft.epage%3D172%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1430-483X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DGRUNDWASSER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D159-172%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D159%26rft.stitle%3DGRUNDWASSER%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DHuber%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DHuggenberger%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DSchindler%2BWildhaber%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=GRUNDWASSER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00767-013-0220-x,"River-groundwater interaction,Hyporheic flow,Spatiotemporal scales,Redds","TEMPERATURE,WATER",,"Univ Basel, Dept Umweltwissensch, Bernoullistr 32, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland"
33,33,"Jung, HS",Feb 2011 ,Modeling of Nitrogen Retention in Amite River,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,"This paper presents an efficient and effective modeling approach to estimation of nitrogen retention in streams and rivers. The approach involves an extension of a newly developed longitudinal solute transport model, variable residence time (VART), by incorporating a first-order nitrogen reaction term. Parameters involved in the VART model are estimated using monthly mean flow and water quality data obtained through both field measurements and watershed modeling using the Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran model. It is found that there is a strong correlation between nitrate-nitrogen removal rate and water temperature. In addition, low nitrate-nitrogen concentrations commonly occur when total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are also low, and high nitrogen concentrations correspond to high DO and TOC, indicating that denitrification is the primary biogeochemical process controlling nitrogen removal in natural rivers. The new approach is demonstrated through the computation of nitrogen removal in the Amite River, LA, USA. Functional relationships between the nitrate-nitrogen removal rate and water temperature are established for the Amite River. Monthly mean nitrate-nitrogen concentrations along the river are computed using the extended VART model, and computed nitrogen concentrations fit observed ones very well. The estimated annual nitrate-nitrogen removal in the Amite River is 27.4 tons or 15.5% of total nitrate-nitrogen transported annually through the Amite River.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000286195800033,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bof%2BNitrogen%2BRetention%2Bin%2BAmite%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DHoon-Shin%26rft.auinit%3DHS%26rft.aulast%3DJung%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11270-010-0487-9%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2932%26rft.epage%3D425%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0049-6979%26rft.issue%3D1-4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BAND%2BSOIL%2BPOLLUTION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D411-425%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D411%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BAIR%2BSOIL%2BPOLL%26rft.volume%3D215%26rft.au%3DJung%252C%2BHS%26rft.au%3DDeng%252C%2BZQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+AIR+AND+SOIL+POLLUTION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11270-010-0487-9,"Denitrification,Hyporheic exchange,Nitrogen retention,River,VART model","NUTRIENT-PERIPHYTON DYNAMICS,TRANSIENT STORAGE ZONES,GULF-OF-MEXICO,STREAM ECOSYSTEMS,MISSISSIPPI RIVER,DISPERSION MODEL,DENITRIFICATION,WATERSHEDS,SCIENCE",,"Louisiana State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA"

For decades, changes in invertebrate depth distribution have been investigated in relation to flood, low flow and drying events, but evidence for use of the hyporheic refuge remains equivocal. This review examines the evidence for the hyporheic zone's refugial role during adverse hydrological conditions. Refuge potential is influenced by determinants in four categories. First, refuge use varies spatially in relation to physical habitat parameters, including sediment porosity and hydrologic exchange. Second, refuge use is temporally variable and reflects disturbance characteristics including rate of onset. Third, refuge use is taxon-specific, depending on a range of morphological, behavioural and physiological traits. Fourth, the behaviours governing refuge use vary, with both active migrations and passive habitat use playing important roles in community persistence. These four determinants interact to influence refuge use; for example, the physical habitat providing an adequate refuge will vary between taxa. Despite this variability, the hyporheic zone is an important component in the suite of refuges that facilitate community resilience to disturbance events. As such, its ecological integrity should be safeguarded through sensitive management and effective rehabilitation schemes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000302356200002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bas%2Ban%2Binvertebrate%2Brefuge%253A%2Ba%2Breview%2Bof%2Bvariability%2Bin%2Bspace%252C%2Btime%252C%2Btaxa%2Band%2Bbehaviour%26rft.aufirst%3DRachel%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DStubbington%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FMF11196%26rft.eissn%3D1448-6059%26rft.epage%3D311%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1323-1650%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D293-311%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D293%26rft.stitle%3DMAR%2BFRESHWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D63&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1071/MF11196,"epigean,hyporheic refuge hypothesis,macroinvertebrate,refugia,refugium","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,BENTHIC COMMUNITY DYNAMICS,FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,SUMMER LOW-FLOWS,ORGANIC-MATTER,GRAVEL-BED,MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES,INTERSTITIAL INVERTEBRATES,GROUNDWATER INTERACTIONS",,"Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Clifton Campus, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England"
35,35,"Zhou, SB",Dec 2014 ,Groundwater-surface water interactions in the hyporheic zone under climate change scenarios,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Slight changes in climate, such as the rise of temperature or alterations of precipitation and evaporation, will dramatically influence nearly all freshwater and climate-related hydrological behavior on a global scale. The hyporheic zone (HZ), where groundwater (GW) and surface waters (SW) interact, is characterized by permeable sediments, low flow velocities, and gradients of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics along the exchange flows. Hyporheic metabolism, that is biogeochemical reactions within the HZ as well as various processes that exchange substances and energy with adjoining systems, is correlated with hyporheic organisms, habitats, and the organic matter (OM) supplied from GW and SW, which will inevitably be influenced by climate-related variations. The characteristics of the HZ in acting as a transition zone and in filtering and purifying exchanged water will be lost, resulting in a weakening of the self-purification capacity of natural water bodies. Thus, as human disturbances intensify in the future, GW and SW pollution will become a greater challenge for mankind than ever before. Biogeochemical processes in the HZ may favor the release of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) under climate change scenarios. Future water resource management should consider the integrity of aquatic systems as a whole, including the HZ, rather than independently focusing on SW and GW.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000345314500021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bunder%2Bclimate%2Bchange%2Bscenarios%26rft.aufirst%3DShangbo%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DZhou%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-014-3255-3%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D13955%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D24%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D13943-13955%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D13943%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DYuan%252C%2BXZ%26rft.au%3DWilliams%252C%2BDD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11356-014-3255-3,"Groundwater,Surfacewater,Hyporheic zone,Climate change,Sediment,Organisms,Biogeochemistry","FRESH-WATER,NITROUS-OXIDE,N2O EMISSIONS,TEMPERATURE RESPONSE,STREAM TEMPERATURE,KEYSTONE PREDATION,ORGANIC-CARBON,CHANGE IMPACTS,SIERRA-NEVADA,RIVER",,"Chongqing Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China"

Two models for predicting horizontal fluid flux through the hyporheic zone, one based solely on valley slope and another that uses both valley slope and channel sinuosity, are presented in this article. Both models require knowledge of aquifer hydraulic conductivity. The models are developed via a suite of groundwater flow simulations with boundary conditions taking a variety of channel geometries, idealized as sinusoidal, and valley slopes that we assume are similar to that of the water table. Functional predictive models are developed by fitting a line or surface to discrete model output which covers the spectrum of most natural meandering rivers. Since the fitted models only require channel slope and/or sinuosity (plus hydraulic conductivity), they are amenable for regional estimation of hyporheic flux using digital terrain data.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000262385500004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW01501%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Blateral%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bvalley%2Bslope%2Band%2Bchannel%2Bsinuosity%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%2BBayani%26rft.auinit%3DMB%26rft.aulast%3DCardenas%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007442%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D45&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2008WR007442,,"NONSORBING SOLUTES,STREAM CHANNEL,EXCHANGE,ZONE,ORGANIZATION,TRANSPORT,PATTERN",,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, 1 Univ Stn C1100,10220 Broomflower Rd, Austin, TX 78712 USA"

Through field investigation, in-situ test, and test analysis, the results show that: (1) the form of mercury in the original stratum where the river water-groundwater hydraulic connection is disconnected is mainly in the residual state, accounting for 77.78% of the total mercury; (2) after the water content increases or the water level changes, the various forms of occurrence in the soil surface layer decrease, and the residual state is still the main form; the main forms of mercury in the sand and pebble layer are diversified, including the residual state, strong organic state and humic acid state; (3) the mercury content in the subsurface zone in winter is higher than that in summer; (4) although the mercury content in groundwater has not been detected, the potential ecological risk of mercury in the disjointed Hyporheic zone near the river in the study area is much higher than the extreme ecological hazard threshold, which has a value of 320. The risk of groundwater pollution caused by mercury during the long-term runoff of the river is higher than that during the flood period. Therefore, relevant departments need to rectify the river as soon as possible, from the source to reduce the ecological risk of heavy metals to groundwater.

Yet such knowledge is essential for sustainable use of agricultural and water resources. This study, carried out in the agricultural region of south-eastern Ireland in Spring 2007, examined the effect of water pollution on hyporheic fauna. Six river sites of known water quality were assigned to two treatments, namely, clean and polluted rivers. Two hyporheic habitats, below the wetted channel (hyporheic substream) and below the exposed gravel bank (parafluvial), were sampled within each treatment. Total invertebrate densities and richness, crustacean densities and richness, and densities of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) were significantly reduced in polluted hyporheic and parafluvial habitats. A higher recorded concentration of nitrate in the polluted hyporheic substream habitats was a significant factor in determining the invertebrate assemblages, with reductions in total and crustacean densities, and EPT richness. Similarly, invertebrate density and richness were reduced in polluted parafluvial habitats, likely being related to agricultural intensity, management practices and reduced riparian buffering. This study highlights the direct effects of agricultural practices on the invertebrate communities of hyporheic habitats and emphasises the need for holistic management and conservation measures to ensure future protection.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000360397200006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bquality%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Binvertebrate%2Bcommunities%2Bin%2Bagricultural%2Bcatchments%26rft.aufirst%3DSamuel%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DKibichii%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FMF14214%26rft.eissn%3D1448-6059%26rft.epage%3D814%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1323-1650%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D805-814%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D805%26rft.stitle%3DMAR%2BFRESHWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D66%26rft.au%3DKibichii%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DFeeley%252C%2BHB%26rft.au%3DKelly-Quinn%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1071/MF14214,"Crustacea,EPT,nitrate enrichment,parafluvial,river hyporheos,sediment","GROUNDWATER INTERACTIONS,STREAM INVERTEBRATES,LAND-USE,BIODIVERSITY,EXCHANGE,ZONE,DISTURBANCE,MANAGEMENT,RESPONSES,HABITATS",,"Univ Coll Dublin, Freshwater Biodivers Ecol & Fisheries Res Grp, UCD Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland"
39,39,"Janzen, K",Win 2011 ,Hyporheic Flows Along a Channelled Peatland: Influence of Beaver Dams,CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL,"Investigation into the effects of beaver darns on hyporheic fluxes in channelled peatlands is needed to better understand how biological processes drive stream-riparian area connections and thus nutrient export, and to improve our overall conceptual model of water storage and flow through peatlands. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of beaver dams on vertical and lateral hyporheic exchange. Hydrometric methods were used to determine subsurface flow pathways and estimate hyporheic water fluxes for a third-order stream draining a Canadian Rocky Mountain peatland in 2006 and 2007. Three sites were studied two contained small, in-channel beaver darns and the third was a control. Vertical hyporheic fluxes equaled or exceeded lateral hyporheic fluxes despite the fact that hydraulic conductivity of the stream bed tended to be lower than the banks, suggesting peat hydraulic properties were not the dominant factor in the development of hyporheic exchange in stream systems draining peatlands as has been reported for streams underlain by mineral substrates. Instead, vertical fluxes were partially influenced by the presence of a mineral lens similar to 0.65 in below the ground surface. As well, high riparian water tables in relation to stream stage were key to limiting lateral fluxes. Steep hydraulic gradients above the two darns created looping flow pathways beneath and around them. However, little water actually flowed along these pathways. Measures of larger fluxes of water to the riparian area above the dams than those returning to the stream below the darns suggests either that hyporheic flow paths are longer than those measured in other studies or that the beaver dams generated recharge to the groundwater flow system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000300335600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BFlows%2BAlong%2Ba%2BChannelled%2BPeatland%253A%2BInfluence%2Bof%2BBeaver%2BDams%26rft.aufirst%3DKimberely%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DJanzen%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4296%252Fcwrj3604846%26rft.eissn%3D1918-1817%26rft.epage%3D347%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0701-1784%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D331-347%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D331%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DJanzen%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DWestbrook%252C%2BCJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+WATER+RESOURCES+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4296/cwrj3604846,,"HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,SOUTHERN ONTARIO,ZONE HYDROLOGY,STREAM,SURFACE,IMPACT,WATER,DYNAMICS,PATTERNS",,"Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C8, Canada"

For two case studies, we numerically simulated fluid flow and solute transport through immobile bed forms composed of heterogeneous sediment and equivalent homogeneous sediment in order to clarify how cross-bedded permeability structures impact hyporheic exchange. The two permeability fields are from the cross-bedded Massillon Sandstone and modern climbing ripple deposits of the Brazos River (Texas). In both cases, permeability heterogeneity creates long hyporheic exchange paths but only slightly increases the depth of exchange relative to equivalent homogeneous sediment. In the Massillon example, permeability heterogeneity increases the proportion of long hyporheic residence times (>3 days). In the Brazos example, permeability heterogeneity increases the proportion of short residence times (<17 h). We attribute the different responses in residence time distributions to differences in permeability patterns near the sediment-water interface. The tails of residence time distributions extend for tens of years and conform to a power law in both heterogeneous and homogeneous sediment. Current-bed form interactions are responsible for the long tails, as opposed to permeability heterogeneity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000268825600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08406%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bflow%2Band%2Bresidence%2Btime%2Bdistributions%2Bin%2Bheterogeneous%2Bcross-bedded%2Bsediment%26rft.aufirst%3DAudrey%2BHucks%26rft.auinit%3DAH%26rft.aulast%3DSawyer%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007632%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2008WR007632,,"NONSORBING SOLUTES,POROUS-MEDIA,PERMEABILITY,WATER,STREAM,ZONE,TOPOGRAPHY,EXCHANGE,FORMS,BLOCK",,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, 1 Univ Stn C9000, Austin, TX 78712 USA"

Although riverbeds are known to attenuate nitrate, it is not known if large woody debris (LWD) can increase this ecosystem service through enhanced hyporheic exchange and streambed residence time. Over a year, we monitored the surface water and pore water chemistry at 200 points along a similar to 50 m reach of a lowland sandy stream with three natural LWD structures. We directly injected N-15-nitrate at 108 locations within the top 1.5 m of the streambed to quantify in situ denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, which, on average, contributed 85, 10 and 5% of total nitrate reduction, respectively. Total nitrate reducing activity ranged from 0 to 16 A mu M h(-1) and was highest in the top 30 cm of the stream bed. Depth, ambient nitrate and water residence time explained 44% of the observed variation in nitrate reduction; fastest rates were associated with slow flow and shallow depths. In autumn, when the river was in spate, nitrate reduction (in situ and laboratory measures) was enhanced around the LWD compared with non-woody areas, but this was not seen in the spring and summer. Overall, there was no significant effect of LWD on nitrate reduction rates in surrounding streambed sediments, but higher pore water nitrate concentrations and shorter residence times, close to LWD, indicated enhanced delivery of surface water into the streambed under high flow. When hyporheic exchange is too strong, overall nitrate reduction is inhibited due to short flow-paths and associated high oxygen concentrations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000416325100009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEnhanced%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bflow%2Baround%2Bwoody%2Bdebris%2Bdoes%2Bnot%2Bincrease%2Bnitrate%2Breduction%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsandy%2Bstreambed%26rft.aufirst%3DFelicity%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DShelley%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-017-0401-2%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D372%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D353-372%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D353%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D136%26rft.au%3DShelley%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DKlaar%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DTrimmer%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10533-017-0401-2,"Anammox,Denitrification,Large woody debris,Nitrate,Riverbed,Restoration","ANAEROBIC AMMONIUM OXIDATION,NITROGEN-RETENTION,AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS,MISSISSIPPI RIVER,FRESH-WATER,DENITRIFICATION,RESTORATION,REMOVAL,GROUNDWATER,NUTRIENT",,"Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England"
42,42,"Wang, LF",Dec 2022 ,"Effect of water chemistry on nitrogen transformation, dissolved organic matter composition and microbial community structure in hyporheic zone sediment columns",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,"Controlled surface water systems, including those with dams lead to dynamic stage changes that alter the fluctuation directions of flow exchange in the hyporheic zones (HZ). However, the nitrogen transformation, dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, and microbial community responding to variable scenarios of water source and hyporheic exchange are poorly studied. The present work investigated nitrogen transformation in HZ sediments, focusing on how microbial community structure and biological functions related to nitrogen transformation and sediment-attached DOM compositions. Upwelling of synthesized groundwater, downwelling of synthesized river water and exchangeable elution of both feed water created distinct microbial zonation and N-transformation processes. Mixing of river water and groundwater enhanced microbial diversity, microbial co-occurrence network complexity and N-transformation functions. In terms of the sediment-attached DOM prop-erties after hyporheic exchanges, humic fractions occupied the predominant chromophoric DOM. Correlation analysis implied that there were more DOM properties, e.g., tryptophan-like proteins, humic-like fractions, and the source of humic fractions, involved in affecting the microbial community under downwelling flow. Co-occurrence network analysis verified that fluorescent components, protein-like and lignin-like fractions in sediment-detached DOM were clustered with microbial communities in one module in downwelling column, implying closer interactions among microbial communities and DOM fractions. The strains of Nitrospinae, Dinghuibacter, and Lentimicrobium etc. were key species collaborating to metabolize both nitrogen and DOM in HZ sediments. The work provides insights into how the nitrogen transformation, DOM compositional changes, as well as the linkages between community structure and DOM factions, response to the changes in water chemistry, leading to valuable insights into hyporheic zone functions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000860523000005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B114246%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bchemistry%2Bon%2Bnitrogen%2Btransformation%252C%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bcomposition%2Band%2Bmicrobial%2Bcommunity%2Bstructure%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bsediment%2Bcolumns%26rft.aufirst%3DLongfei%26rft.auinit%3DLF%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.envres.2022.114246%26rft.eissn%3D1096-0953%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-9351%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.part%3D1%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D215%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BLF%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BYT%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114246,"Hyporheic sediment,Nitrogen transformation,Dissolved organic matter (DOM),FT-ICR,Microbial community structure,Co -occurrence network","EXCHANGE FLOWS,GROUNDWATER,RIVER,DENITRIFICATION,RESPONSES,DYNAMICS,CARBON",,"Hohai Univ, Coll Environm, Key Lab Integrated Regulat & Resource Dev Shallow, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
43,43,"Ader, E",Mar 15 2021 ,Logjams as a driver of transient storage in a mountain stream,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"We use four stream segments along a wood-rich, pool-riffle mountain stream in the Southern Rockies of Colorado, USA to examine how spatial variations in wood load and variations in discharge during and after the snowmelt peak flow influence the magnitude of surface and subsurface transient storage. Segments range in complexity from a single channel with no large wood to an anabranching channel with closely spaced, channel-spanning logjams. Discharges at which transient storage was assessed range from base flow to snowmelt peak flow. To explore these relations, we used 10 geomorphic variables representing channel morphology and bed substrate, four wood-related variables representing wood load and associated backwater storage, and two measures of skewness from instream and bulk electrical conductivity breakthrough curves during tracer tests. Instream curves reflect surface and subsurface transient storage, whereas bulk curves primarily represent subsurface transient storage. Higher values of skewness indicate greater retention, and we used the values here as a metric of increased transient storage. Although limited sample size restricts the power of our results, our findings suggest that stream segments with greater instream large wood loads have more and larger pools, greater storage of fine sediment and particulate organic matter, and higher values of skew from instream conductivity. The results also suggest that the presence of instream wood, rather than changes in channel morphology associated with wood, is the most important driver of transient storage. This implies that river management designed to foster transient storage should focus on retaining instream large wood. We did not find significant correlations between geomorphic or wood-related variables and the skew estimated from bulk conductivity, which may reflect the relatively thin alluvium present in the field area and the prevalence of surface transient storage in this system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000613872100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLogjams%2Bas%2Ba%2Bdriver%2Bof%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bin%2Ba%2Bmountain%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DEthan%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DAder%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fesp.5057%26rft.eissn%3D1096-9837%26rft.epage%3D711%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0197-9337%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DEARTH%2BSURFACE%2BPROCESSES%2BAND%2BLANDFORMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D701-711%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D701%26rft.stitle%3DEARTH%2BSURF%2BPROC%2BLAND%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DAder%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DWohl%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DSingha%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=EARTH+SURFACE+PROCESSES+AND+LANDFORMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/esp.5057,"hyporheic exchange,large wood,logjam,mountain stream,transient storage","LARGE WOODY DEBRIS,COLORADO FRONT RANGE,OLD-GROWTH FOREST,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,FLOW RESISTANCE,POOL,TRANSPORT,RIVERS,ZONE,CASCADES",,"Colorado State Univ, Dept Geosci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA"
44,44,"Wei, WX",2017 ,Spatial distribution of crustacean zooplankton in a large river-connected lake related to trophic status and fish,JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,"It has been reported that community structure of crustacean zooplankton is related to environment factors and abundance of predacious fishes. Most studies, however were based on observation on independent water bodies, which may complicate the results with uninterested factors. A large river-connected lake has partitioned regions with the characteristics of either a river or a lake albeit allowing exchanging of zooplankton of different regions. Thus, a river-connected lake is an ideal system for studying distribution of crustacean zooplankton and investigating its affecting factors. In this study, 11 stations of a large river-connected lake, Lake Gaoyou, were sampled in all four seasons. Taxonomic diversity and species abundance were recorded and their correlation with environmental factors was investigated. A total of 26 and 22 species of crustacean zooplankton were recorded in the river and lake region, respectively. The abundance of crustacean in the river region was significantly higher than that in the lake region. The relative abundance of calanoids and Bosmina fatalis in the river region was lower than that in the lake region, whereas the abundance of cyclopoids and other cladocera species was lower in the lake region than in the river region. Cluster analysis showed that crustacean assemblages could be divided into two, one cluster grouping all sites from the river region, and the other cluster included all sites in the lake region. According to Pearson correlation and canonical correspondence analysis, the distribution of crustacean was positively correlated with water temperature and chlorophyll a gradient. Chlorophyll a and fish abundance are excellent predictors on spatial distribution of crustacean zooplankton in Lake Gaoyou. Our findings may also help in planning of bighead carp stocking in Lake Gaoyou.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000416222200009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2Bcrustacean%2Bzooplankton%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Briver-connected%2Blake%2Brelated%2Bto%2Btrophic%2Bstatus%2Band%2Bfish%26rft.aufirst%3DWenzhi%26rft.auinit%3DWX%26rft.aulast%3DWei%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4081%252Fjlimnol.2017.1622%26rft.eissn%3D1723-8633%26rft.epage%3D554%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1129-5767%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D546-554%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D546%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D76%26rft.au%3DWei%252C%2BWX%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BRM%26rft.au%3DFu%252C%2BLX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1622,"River-connected lake,crustacean zooplankton,trophic status,fish","SHALLOW LAKES,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,TEMPERATE LAKES,POYANG LAKE,WATER,MACROPHYTES,EUTROPHICATION,PHYTOPLANKTON,ASSEMBLAGE,RESERVOIR",,"Yangzhou Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, 88 South Univ Rd, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China"
45,45,"Clark, C",Sep 2021 ,Reach-scale stream temperature response to large wood placement,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,"Climate change models indicate that stream temperatures within much of the Columbia River Basin will increase significantly in the next 50 years leading to inhospitable conditions for salmonid fishes in several stream reaches. Restoration measures such as riparian planting, maintaining instream flows, and large wood (LW) placement are thought to ameliorate the impacts of climate change on stream temperatures. While LW placement is known to improve habitat complexity, it is unclear whether it will also help reduce summer stream temperatures. To help understand the influence of LW placement on stream temperatures, we monitored nine interior Columbia River Basin LW projects using an extensive posttreatment study design. We mapped stream bottom temperatures, topography, and physical habitat in paired treatment (LW placement) and control reaches to compare water temperatures and cool-water patches between reaches. We found no difference in the mean or the variance in overall reach temperatures or thalweg temperatures between treatment and control reaches. Mapping found variation in water temperatures of less than 0.5 degrees C within reaches, making mapping of cool-water patches impractical and further emphasized the lack of temperature differences. Our results indicate that LW placement projects in the interior Columbia River Basin do not appear to be decreasing reach-scale summer water temperatures or creating cool water refugia for fishes. Moreover, the current configuration and implementation of LW placement projects, which typically focus on placing wood on banks and channel margins, are unlikely to ameliorate the effects of climate change on stream temperatures.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000663841700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be13433%26rft.atitle%3DReach-scale%2Bstream%2Btemperature%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Blarge%2Bwood%2Bplacement%26rft.aufirst%3DChristopher%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DClark%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Frec.13433%26rft.eissn%3D1526-100X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1061-2971%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DRESTORATION%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DRESTOR%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DClark%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DKrall%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DCeder%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=RESTORATION+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/rec.13433,"climate change,cool-water refuge,hyporheic connectivity,stream restoration,stream temperature monitoring","JUVENILE COHO SALMON,COLD-WATER PATCHES,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,CHINOOK SALMON,CLIMATE-CHANGE,BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION,THERMAL HETEROGENEITY,ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH,CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY,RESTORATION",,"Bur Land Management, Eastern Interior Field Off, 222 Univ Ave, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA"
46,46,"Liu, SN",Jun 2018 ,Impacts of different rainfall patterns on hyporheic zone under transient conditions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays an important role in stream ecology. Previous studies have mainly focused on the factors influencing the HZ in the steady state. However, the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the HZ can become transient during a storm. This study investigates the impacts of different rainfall patterns (varying in intensity and duration) on the HZ under transient conditions. A two-dimensional numerical model of a 10-m long and 2-m deep domain is developed, in which the streambed consists of a series of dunes. Brinkman-Darcy and Navier-Stokes equations are respectively solved for groundwater and surface water, and velocity and pressure are coupled at the interface (i.e., the streambed surface). To compare the results under different transient conditions, this study proposes two indicators, i.e., the influential time (IT, the time required for the HZ to return to its initial state once it starts to change) and the influential depth (ID, the maximum increment in the HZ depth). To detect the extent to which the HZ undergoes significant spatial changes, moving split-window and inflection point tests are conducted. The results indicate that rainfall intensity (RI) and rainfall duration (RD) both display logarithmic relationships with the IT and ID with high coefficients of determination, but only between certain lower and upper thresholds of the RI and RD. Moreover, the distributions of the IT and ID as a function of the RI and RD are mapped using the surface spline and kriging interpolation methods to facilitate future prediction of the IT and ID. In addition, it is observed that the IT has a linear negative correlation with the groundwater response while the ID is not affected by different groundwater responses. All of the derived relationships can be used to predict the impacts of a future rainfall event on the HZ.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000439401800046,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpacts%2Bof%2Bdifferent%2Brainfall%2Bpatterns%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bunder%2Btransient%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DSuning%26rft.auinit%3DSN%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2018.04.019%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.epage%3D608%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D598-608%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D598%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D561%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BSN%26rft.au%3DChui%252C%2BTFM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.019,"Hyporheic zone,Transient responses,Rainfall patterns,Influential time,Influential depth","4TH-ORDER MOUNTAIN STREAM,FALL CHINOOK SALMON,SPATIAL INTERPOLATION,POTENTIAL EVAPORATION,AGRICULTURAL STREAM,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,RESIDENCE TIMES,COLUMBIA RIVER,WATER EXCHANGE,STORM DYNAMICS",,"Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Room 6-18A, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China"
47,47,"Claret, C",Oct 2003 ,Diel variation in surface and subsurface microbial activity along a gradient of drying in an Australian sand-bed stream,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Microbes play key roles in nutrient transformation and organic matter mineralisation in the hyporheic zone but their short-term responses to diel variations in discharge and temperature are unknown. Rates of microbial esterase activity were hypothesised to vary vertically and along a gradient of moisture in a drying sand-bed stream where discharge fluctuated daily in response to evapotranspiration.2. At 'fully saturated', 'moist' and 'dry' locations in three sites along a drying Australian sand-bed stream, microbial activity at three depths ( surface, 10 and 30 cm) was assessed using fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. Samples were collected in mid-summer in the late afternoon and again at dawn to assess diel variation in hydrolytic activity at each site and depth. Data loggers tracked diel variations in temperature at each depth.3. Hydrolytic activity was up to 10-fold greater in the surface sediments in late afternoon than at dawn in all habitats, and was correlated with surface sediment temperature. Diel differences in activity were not detected at 10 cm, although daily thermal cycles were evident at this depth. Unexpectedly, activity was marginally higher at dawn at 30 cm in all habitats, perhaps reflecting lags in temperature at that depth.4. Overall, microbial activity declined with depth, strongly correlated with vertical trends in total organic matter and concentrations of dissolved phosphorus. Particulate organic matter, probably buried during a flood 35 days earlier, appeared largely responsible for these vertical trends. On the other hand, there was little evidence for hydrological exchange between much of the hyporheic zone and the surface stream, implying that processes in the subsurface zone of this stream are effectively isolated during baseflow in mid-summer.5. Diel cycles of wetting and drying in the moist habitats did not enhance esterase activity relative to the dry or fully saturated habitats. Sediment moisture was not correlated with microbial activity, and mats of senescent algae appeared to inhibit water loss from surface sediments in the moist habitat. In this sand-bed stream, local diel fluctuations in water level appear to have less influence on microbial activity and mineralisation of organic matter in the sediments than occasional floods that bury leaf litter and renew many hyporheic zone functions. Subreach-scale processes seem to be the major driving force of microbial processes and nutrient cycling in this sand-bed river.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000185347900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDiel%2Bvariation%2Bin%2Bsurface%2Band%2Bsubsurface%2Bmicrobial%2Bactivity%2Balong%2Ba%2Bgradient%2Bof%2Bdrying%2Bin%2Ban%2BAustralian%2Bsand-bed%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DC%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DClaret%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.2003.01120.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1755%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1739-1755%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1739%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DClaret%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01120.x,"esterase activity,fluorescein diacetate,hyporheic,inorganic nutrients,temperature","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,FLUORESCEIN DIACETATE HYDROLYSIS,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,RIVER SEDIMENTS,UPLAND STREAM,METABOLISM,FLOODPLAIN,RETENTION",,"Univ Aix Marseille 3, IMEP, CNRS, UMR 6116, Case 31, F-13397 Marseille 20, France"

In this study, to estimate the influent and effluent subsurface water fluxes under limited geo-hydrometeorological data availability conditions, a simple stream-aquifer interaction model, namely, the variable parameter McCarthy-Muskingum (VPMM) hillslopestorage Boussinesq (hsB) model, has been developed. This novel model couples the VPMM streamflow transport with the hsB groundwater flow transport modules in online mode. In this integrated model, the surface water-groundwater flux exchange process is modelled by the Darcian approach with the variable hydraulic heads between the river stage and groundwater table accounting for the rainfall forcing. Considering the exchange fluxes in the hyporheic zone and lateral overland flow contribution, this approach is field tested in a typical 48-km stretch of the Brahmani River in eastern India to simulate the streamflow and its depth with the minimum NashSutcliffe efficiency of 94% and 88%; the maximum root mean square error of 134 m3/s and 0.35 m; and the minimum index of agreement of 98% and 97%, respectively.

Applications of these results to ion accelerator and inertial confinement fusion experiments are discussed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000451709500013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOscillating%2Btwo-stream%2Binstability%2Bin%2Bstrongly%2Bcoupled%2Bplasma%26rft.aufirst%3DPrerana%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DSharma%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1017%252FS0263034618000368%26rft.eissn%3D1469-803X%26rft.epage%3D383%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0263-0346%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DLASER%2BAND%2BPARTICLE%2BBEAMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D376-383%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D376%26rft.stitle%3DLASER%2BPART%2BBEAMS%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DSharma%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DAvinash%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DGupta%252C%2BDN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0A846Uo7iXrdpyeg85xL3sa&SrcJTitle=LASER+AND+PARTICLE+BEAMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1017/S0263034618000368,"Inertial confinement fusion,laser-driven ion acceleration,oscillating two-stream instability,strongly coupled plasma","2 STREAM INSTABILITY,LOW-FREQUENCY MODES,PARAMETRIC-INSTABILITIES,RESISTIVE INSTABILITY,LASER,WAVE,ION,DEPENDENCE,SCATTERING,PHYSICS",,"Univ Delhi, Dept Phys & Astrophys, Delhi 110007, India"
