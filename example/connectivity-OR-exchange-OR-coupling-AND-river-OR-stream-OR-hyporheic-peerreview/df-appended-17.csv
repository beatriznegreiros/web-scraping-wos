0,0,"Ou, CM",Aug 2014 ,Evolution characters of water exchange abilities between Dongting Lake and Yangtze River,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,"By using field-survey hydrological data of the related control stations in Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River mainstream in 1951-2010, the evolution characters of water exchange abilities between the two water bodies and their response to the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) from different time scales are analyzed based on their hydraulic relations. The results are shown as follows. Firstly, during July-September, the replenishment ability of Three Outlets to Dongting Lake is stronger, and in January-March, the replenishment ability of Dongting Lake to Yangtze River is stronger. Secondly, there has been an obvious inter-decadal wave on the water exchange coefficient between Dongting Lake and Yangtze River. In 1951-1958 and 1959-1968, the replenishment ability of Three Outlets to Dongting Lake was stronger, but in 2003-2010, the replenishment ability of Dongting Lake to Yangtze River has been strengthened. Thirdly, the spill-division ability of Three Outlets weakens, and the water of Dongting Lake coming from Three Outlets decreases either in typical years or under different dispatching modes of the TGR after the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir. Furthermore, the water of Dongting Lake coming from Four Rivers takes the dominant position, which obviously enhances the replenishment ability of Dongting Lake to Yangtze River. Fourthly, if the effect of the runoff fluctuation in the basin is not considered, the evolution characters of the exchange capacities and the exchange process between Dongting Lake and Yangtze River in different time scales are generally changed with the variation of the water exchange amount between them, although the factors influencing the water exchange capacities between them is very complex. These show that there is an in-line growth or decline relation between the river-lake water exchange ability and the river-lake water exchange amount.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000335121600010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvolution%2Bcharacters%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Babilities%2Bbetween%2BDongting%2BLake%2Band%2BYangtze%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DChaomin%26rft.auinit%3DCM%26rft.aulast%3DOu%2BChaomin%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11442-014-1116-0%26rft.eissn%3D1861-9568%26rft.epage%3D745%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1009-637X%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOGRAPHICAL%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D731-745%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D731%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOGR%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DOu%252C%2BCM%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BJB%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BZH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOGRAPHICAL+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11442-014-1116-0,"water exchange coefficient,evolution of water exchange function,Dongting Lake,Yangtze River",AREA,,"Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Informat Syst & Management, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China"

This paper presents coordinated streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) modifications, termed Biohydrochemical Enhancement Structures for Streamwater Treatment (BEST), to efficiently drive interchange, attenuating nutrients, metals, and pathogens. Numerical models consisted of sandy HZ with high and low K streambed media components, and variable slope and in situ sediment K. BEST contaminant mitigation was estimated using hyporheic flow and residence time (RT) simulations and contaminant removal rate constants from literature for specific porous media. Hyporheic flows improved, whereas mean RT decreased approximately linearly with increasing slope and in situ K. Despite vast differences in flow and RT, contaminant removal potential was relatively consistent among BEST in which reaction time scales were similar to or shorter than RTs. However, BEST with excessive RTs were less efficient. Most contaminants could be attenuated within a series of BEST 50 m in length, suggesting that BEST could be an effective stormwater best management practice for small streams.

2,2,"Aghababaei, M",Feb 2023 ,Temporal moments of one-dimensional advective-dispersive transport with exchange represented via memory function models: Application to river corridor transport,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Practical simulation of solute transport in river corridors often relies on one-dimensional transport models with solute flux between river and hyporheic zone governed by a mass exchange term, perhaps most generally expressed using the 'memory function' formalism. While expressions for temporal moments of solute breakthrough curves (BTCs) are available for a number of such models, those for memory function forms are not, to our knowledge. Here we report closed-form BTC temporal moment expressions for memory function forms, found by exploiting the connection to phase exposure-dependent exchange (PhEDEx) formulations. We use these results to investigate the general capability of the memory function form to accommodate specific scaling of river tracer temporal moments reported in the literature, and we apply the method to identification of parameters in application to two recent tracer tests. The applications involve a simple numerical solution to the memory function river corridor transport model calibrated using measured temporal moments of the tracer test BTCs. The numerical model is validated only for the classical case of the transient storage model without lateral inflow, the analytical solution for which we adapt from the Lassey solution for mobile-immobile exchange in porous media. It should be noted that the temporal moments results obtained here in the context of river corridor transport also apply to one-dimensional transport in two-domain (mobile-immobile) porous media, when governed by a twodomain memory function model.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000922482000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B104383%26rft.atitle%3DTemporal%2Bmoments%2Bof%2Bone-dimensional%2Badvective-dispersive%2Btransport%2Bwith%2Bexchange%2Brepresented%2Bvia%2Bmemory%2Bfunction%2Bmodels%253A%2BApplication%2Bto%2Briver%2Bcorridor%2Btransport%26rft.aufirst%3DMohammad%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DAghababaei%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2023.104383%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D172%26rft.au%3DAghababaei%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DGinn%252C%2BTR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.advwatres.2023.104383,"River,Transport,Memory function,Temporal moments analysis","SOLUTE TRANSPORT,TRANSIENT STORAGE,INTEGRODIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,LEAKY AQUIFERS,WATER-QUALITY,STREAM,SIMULATION,TURBULENCE",,"Washington State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, Pullman, WA 99163 USA"
3,3,"Poole, GC",Jun 2001 ,An ecological perspective on in-stream temperature: Natural heat dynamics and mechanisms of human-caused thermal degradation,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"While external factors (drivers) determine the net heat energy and water delivered to a stream, the internal structure of a stream determines how heat and water will be distributed within and exchanged among a stream's components (channel, alluvial aquifer, and riparian zone/floodplain). Therefore, the interaction between external drivers of stream temperature and the internal structure of integrated stream systems ultimately determines channel water temperature. This paper presents a synoptic, ecologically based discussion of the external drivers of stream temperature, the internal structures and processes that insulate and buffer stream temperatures, and the mechanisms of human influence on stream temperature. It provides a holistic perspective on the diversity of natural dynamics and human activities that influence stream temperature, including discussions of the role of the hyporheic zone. Key management implications include: (1) Protecting or reestablishing in-stream flow is critical for restoring desirable thermal regimes in streams. (2) Modified riparian vegetation, groundwater dynamics, and channel morphology are all important pathways of human influence on channel-water temperature and each pathway should be addressed in management plans. (3) Stream temperature research and monitoring programs will be jeopardized by an inaccurate or incomplete conceptual understanding of complex temporal and spatial stream temperature response patterns to anthropogenic influences. (4) Analyses of land-use history and the historical vs contemporary structure of the stream channel, riparian zone, and alluvial aquifer are important prerequisites for applying mechanistic temperature models to develop management prescriptions to meet in-channel temperature goals.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000168763300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2Becological%2Bperspective%2Bon%2Bin-stream%2Btemperature%253A%2BNatural%2Bheat%2Bdynamics%2Band%2Bmechanisms%2Bof%2Bhuman-caused%2Bthermal%2Bdegradation%26rft.aufirst%3DGC%26rft.auinit%3DGC%26rft.aulast%3DPoole%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs002670010188%26rft.eissn%3D1432-1009%26rft.epage%3D802%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0364-152X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D787-802%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D787%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMANAGE%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DPoole%252C%2BGC%26rft.au%3DBerman%252C%2BCH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s002670010188,"stream temperature management,shade,hyporheic zone,groundwater,channel morphology,riparian vegetation,anthropogenic influences","LARGE WOODY DEBRIS,SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,CHINOOK SALMON,ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE,CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY,SURFACE-WATER,LAND-USE,RIVER,HABITAT,RIPARIAN",,"Ecometr, 4051 Wildflower Lane, Tucker, GA 30084 USA"
4,4,"Ward, AS",Jan-feb 2016 ,The evolution and state of interdisciplinary hyporheic research,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Hyporheic zones are of broad interest, given their location at the interface between surface and groundwaters, numerous ecological functions, and location as a zone of interdependent physical, chemical, and biological processes. Hyporheic research has been successful in study of individual processes, but our understanding of coupled, interacting processes in hyporheic zones remains limited. Based on an analysis of publications and citations, interest in the hyporhec zone was catalyzed by ecological functions, and interest has become more balanced across disciplines and functions in recent years. Analysis of publications and field studies spanning 12 identified hyporheic processes demonstrates that studies commonly focus on 1-3 processes limiting our ability to characterize interaction or interdependence of hyporheic processes. Analysis of field studies demonstrate that the most frequently studies scales are second- and third-order streams with longitudinal, lateral, and vertical scales of 10-1000+ m, 1-10, and 0-1m, respectively. These studies commonly considered variations spanning timescales of storm events to seasons. I identified a total of 86 variables used to characterize hyporheic processes of which the most frequently reported 14 variables represent more than 50% of all variables found in this analysis. Thus, a relatively small suite of variables may hold key information to enable cross-site comparison of findings. Future hyporheic research should address the challenges of (1) defining common metadata to support interdisciplinary research and cross-site comparison and (2) quantifying spatial and temporal heterogeneity in hyporheic functions to enable multi-scale assessment and prediction of hyporheic processes.

5,5,"Mitton, A",Mar 28 2022 ,Aquifer-Stream Exchanges and the Importance of Groundwater Discharge for Maintaining Instream Habitat and Benthic Macroinvertebrates,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"Periods of streamflow cessation and stream drying are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions of the world due to climate change, land-use change, and increased groundwater pumping. Thus, streams with intermittent flow will likely continue to grow in their global extent, which is thought to already surpass that of perennial streams. Yet, variability in streamflow and aquifer-stream exchange associated with flow cessation and drying is not well understood, nor is the influence of hydrological variability on aquatic communities and their habitat. This study aimed to characterize the heterogeneity of physical and chemical characteristics of habitat and the associated variability in benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities in relation to spatial and temporal variability in streamflow and aquifer-stream exchange. Habitat conditions and BMI communities varied between individual sites, riffle and pool habitat, and between an intermittent riffle and a perennial riffle maintained by groundwater discharge. Unlike other studies, BMI richness, diversity, and abundance were consistently higher at intermittent riffle sites than perennial riffle sites, which were similar in BMI community composition to pool sites. High velocity distinguished the intermittent riffle sites, while two flow-loving BMI taxa distinguished their communities. This suggests that site-specific heterogeneity in habitat conditions was a key control on spatial and temporal variability in BMI communities due to the habitat preferences of certain BMI taxa. Low richness, diversity, and high dominance of highly tolerant taxa across the site suggested long-term patterns of extreme variability in habitat conditions associated with flow cessation and drying were the primary control on BMI communities. Thus, the interactive effects of these controls may produce unexpected patterns in BMI community richness, diversity, and composition in relation to longitudinal patterns of groundwater discharge and flow persistence. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering the influence of heterogeneity in environmental conditions at multiple spatial and temporal scales when interpreting relationships between hydrological and abiotic or biotic ecological variable in streams with intermittent flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000805211400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B768836%26rft.atitle%3DAquifer-Stream%2BExchanges%2Band%2Bthe%2BImportance%2Bof%2BGroundwater%2BDischarge%2Bfor%2BMaintaining%2BInstream%2BHabitat%2Band%2BBenthic%2BMacroinvertebrates%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMitton%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffeart.2022.768836%26rft.eissn%3D2296-6463%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BEARTH%2BSC-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DMitton%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DAllen%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+EARTH+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/feart.2022.768836,"groundwater,instream habitat,benthic macroinvertebrates,aquifer-stream exchange,groundwater dependent ecosystem (GDE),flow cessation,intermittent stream","COMMUNITY RESPONSES,INTERMITTENT RIVERS,EPHEMERAL STREAMS,HEADWATER STREAMS,SURFACE-WATER,FLOW,DROUGHT,INVERTEBRATES,ASSEMBLAGES,HYDROLOGY",,"Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada"
6,6,"Zhou, T",Apr 2018 ,Riverbed Hydrologic Exchange Dynamics in a Large Regulated River Reach,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydrologic exchange flux (HEF) is an important hydrologic component in river corridors that includes both bidirectional (hyporheic) and unidirectional (gaining/losing) surface water-groundwater exchanges. Quantifying HEF rates in a large regulated river is difficult due to the large spatial domains, complexity of geomorphologic features and subsurface properties, and the great stage variations created by dam operations at multiple time scales. In this study, we developed a method that combined numerical modeling and field measurements for estimating HEF rates across the riverbed in a 7 km long reach of the highly regulated Columbia River. A high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling framework was developed and validated by field measurements and other modeling results to characterize the HEF dynamics across the riverbed. We found that about 85% of the time from 2008 to 2014 the river was losing water with an annual average net HEF rates across the riverbed (Q(z)) of -2.3 m(3) s(-1) (negative indicating downwelling). June was the only month that the river gained water, with monthly averaged Qz of 0.8 m(3) s(-1). We also found that the daily dam operations increased the hourly gross gaining and losing rate over an average year of 8% and 2%, respectively. By investigating the HEF feedbacks at various time scales, we suggest that the dam operations could reduce the HEF at seasonal time scale by decreasing the seasonal flow variations, while also enhance the HEF at subdaily time scale by generating high-frequency discharge variations. These changes could generate significant impacts on biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone.Plain Language Summary Dam operations regulate downstream water flow and modify the surface water and groundwater interactions. In this study, we simulated river and groundwater dynamics in a 7 km long reach of Columbia River using a high-resolution numerical model. Due to the upstream dam regulations, the daily river stage variation of our study reach could be as high as 2 m. We found that about 85% of the time from 2008 to 2014 the river was losing water with an annual average net HEF rates across the riverbed of 2.3 m(3) s(-1). June was the only month that the river gained water, with gaining rate of 0.8 m(3) s(-1). We also found that the daily dam operations enhanced the losing and gaining activities, which may lead to great impact on riverbed biogeochemical processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434186400012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiverbed%2BHydrologic%2BExchange%2BDynamics%2Bin%2Ba%2BLarge%2BRegulated%2BRiver%2BReach%26rft.aufirst%3DTian%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DZhou%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR020508%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D2730%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2715-2730%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2715%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DBao%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DZachara%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017WR020508,,"DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,FRESH-WATER ZONE,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,HEADWATER STREAMS,FLOW,SURFACE,MODEL,NETWORK,DENITRIFICATION",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99354 USA"

The residence time of transient storage and retardation factor varied a factor of 8 and 27, respectively, with the choice of method. Methods that emphasize the tail of the tracer breakthrough, such as optimization of log-concentrations, are required to provide accurate estimates of transient storage parameters, whereas optimization using normal values can lead to substantial errors. Moment matching techniques require a solute mass-recovery higher than about 70% for a reliable estimate of the storage capacity. The pumping model provided good estimates of the storage in the hyporheic zone under different stream discharges at two tracer test events with tritiated water in the Hobol River, Norway. The accuracy of the evaluation of the transient storage parameters decreases with distance in the stream caused primarily by decreasing precision in the measurements and insufficient mass-recovery. With distance, more and more time-scales representing the hyporheic zone flow are also manifested as signatures of the tracer breakthrough. In a stream-landscape groundwater system that is characterized by multiple residence time-scales, stream tracer results are limited to specific reach distances and need to be supported by theory or other data when generalized to longer distances.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000250048500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW10405%26rft.atitle%3DReach%2Bscale%2Band%2Bevaluation%2Bmethods%2Bas%2Blimitations%2Bfor%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Bproperties%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Band%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DAnders%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DWorman%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2006WR005808%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DWorman%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DWachniew%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2006WR005808,,"SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,SEASONAL-VARIATION,MOUNTAIN STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,BED FORMS,MODEL,TRACER",,"Royal Inst Technol, Dept Land & Water Resources Engn, Stockholm, Sweden"
8,8,"Grant, SB",May 19 2012 ,Effective diffusivity and mass flux across the sediment-water interface in streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of water between a stream and its hyporheic zone (defined as the sediment beneath and immediately adjacent to a stream) underpins many ecological and hydrological functions in turbulent streams. Hyporheic exchange can be parameterized in terms of an effective diffusion coefficient D-eff and considerable effort has gone into developing process-based models and empirical correlations for predicting the value of this transport parameter. In this paper we demonstrate previous laboratory estimates for D-eff can be biased by as much as a factor of 10, due to errors in the equations and/or ambiguities in the variables used to reduce data from transient tracer experiments in flow-through and recirculating flumes. After correcting these problems, an analysis of 93 previously published flume experiments reveals D-eff depends on properties of the tracer (molecular diffusivity), flow field (shear velocity, kinematic viscosity), and sediment bed (permeability and depth). The shear velocity depends implicitly on the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, which captures the influence of bed roughness and bed forms on hyporheic exchange in both laboratory and field studies. The dependence of D-eff on sediment bed depth is consistent with the hypothesis that coherent turbulence in the water column drives mass transport across the sediment-water interface. Furthermore, the dependence of D-eff on sediment bed depth raises the possibility that hyporheic exchange rates measured in the laboratory are not representative of hyporheic exchange rates in the field.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000304253700002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW05548%26rft.atitle%3DEffective%2Bdiffusivity%2Band%2Bmass%2Bflux%2Bacross%2Bthe%2Bsediment-water%2Binterface%2Bin%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DStanley%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DGrant%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011148%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DGrant%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DStewardson%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DMarusic%252C%2BI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2011WR011148,,"HYPORHEIC ZONE,BED FORMS,GROUNDWATER INTERACTIONS,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSPORT,MODEL,RIVER,FLOW,COEFFICIENTS",,"Univ Calif Irvine, Henry Samueli Sch Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E4130 Engn Gateway, Irvine, CA 92697 USA"
9,9,"Kim, H",Aug 1 2018 ,Combining pyrosequencing and isotopic approaches to assess denitrification in a hyporheic zone,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Hyporheic zones are considered hot spots for numerically vast and phylogenetically diverse microbial communities. However, biogeochemical effects of hyporheic zones have rarely been investigated in detail because of the difficulty in accurately measuring denitrification in these zones. To date, little is known about the hydroecology of hyporheic zones. The effect of changes in hydraulic conditions on the community variations of indigenous microorganisms and water quality was examined based on the depth of the hyporheic zone. In particular, we report on the use of the pyrosequencing technique to elucidate denitrifying bacteria (DNB) community profiles combined with the stable isotope composition of nitrate and hydrological patterns in the hyporheic zones to reveal whether denitrification occurs. delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3 values of nitrate were analyzed to evaluate the transformation processes of nitrate in upwelling and downwelling areas and mixed zones. The isotope values indicated different origins of water in upwelling and downwelling zones and that denitrification occurred predominantly in the upwelling areas. Analyses of microbial communities in the hyporheic zone showed that the new genera, species, and isotope data were associated with the hydrological uniqueness of the hyporheic zones. The 16S rRNA sequences were determined and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the DNB communities distributed and gathered the genus Comamonas denitrificans within the mixing patterns of the hyporheic zones and that the relative scarcity of these microbes in these zones was caused by the lack of appropriate substrates. The delineation of the surface water-groundwater mixing zone was quantitatively determined by systematically combining the hydrological and heat transfer analyses and by comparing denitrifying bacteria communities and N isotope data. This study showed that pyrosequencing and isotopic approaches are useful for evaluating the transformation processes of nitrate at the upwelling and downwelling points of a hyporheic zone.

10,10,"Palumbo-Roe, B",Aug 2017 ,Limitations on the role of the hyporheic zone in chromium natural attenuation in a contaminated urban stream,APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY,"The urban hyporheic zone may offer natural attenuation potential for contaminants. This potential is contaminant-specific and may be spatially and temporally variable. The aim of this study was the assessment of the natural attenuation potential of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream receiving hexavalent chromium (Cr)-rich effluents from the historical land disposal of chromite ore processing residue (COPR) in Glasgow, Scotland. The evidence based approach involved the use of a network of multilevel piezometers for best capturing potential anoxic field conditions and fine-scale spatial gradients in solute concentrations of surface water and porewater. In-situ porewater sampling was integrated with sediment sampling and reach-scale monitoring of stream water quality. The results show a sharp decrease of total dissolved (filtered <0.45 gm) Cr concentrations at the surface water sediment boundary in all profiles, from Cr mean values of 1100 mu g l(-1) in surface water to 5 mu g l(-1) in porewater. Chromium speciation analysis indicates that no Cr(VI) was detectable in the neutral pH, moderately reducing porewater, while it was the dominant species in surface water. Evidence of historical COPR detrital grains contributed to the total Cr concentrations (size fraction <150 mu m) up to 8800 mg kg(-1) in the streambed sediment. The abundance in the porewater of Fe (mean value = 1700 mu g l(-1)), mainly as Fe(II), a natural electron donor for Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III), indicates a high natural attenuation potential of the hyporheic zone for downwelling dissolved Cr, through Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) and the formation of Cr(III) solids of low solubility. Authigenic Cr-rich rims on particles also documented active Cr precipitation from solution in the fine sediments. Large short-term changes of stream stage and stream water composition were not reflected in the hyporheic conservative (chloride) and reactive solute composition. This result indicates only limited surface water infiltration and suggests that small advective exchange might limit the effectiveness of the hyporheic zone for enhancing Cr surface water quality at the reach-scale. This is supported by further evidence from preliminary surface water quality synoptic sampling which shows only moderate to low downstream decrease in surface water Cr concentrations. The surface water investigation needs to be supported by combined water quality-flow monitoring and to be extended to a wider range of temporal and spatial scales to corroborate the reach-scale findings.

11,11,"Pretty, JL",Oct 30 2006 ,Nutrient dynamics in relation to surface-subsurface hydrological exchange in a groundwater fed chalk stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Mini-piezometers were used to assess surface-subsurface hydrological exchange and biogeochemical processing in different patches on the river bed (coarse gravel, fine gravel/sand, silt/sand) at two sites on the River Lambourn (Berkshire, UK). Positive vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) dominated the riverbed, indicating potentially upwelling subsurface water. Hydraulic conductivity was highly variable in the shallow sediments, but was generally low at greater depths, suggesting that positive VHG may not translate to the rapid movement of subsurface water. Well defined areas of downwelling were not identified, although negative VHG did occur at the low/intermediate depths (similar to 10-20 cm). Furthermore, steep temperature gradients within the top 30 cm suggested that connectivity with the surface water was restricted to a shallow layer within the sediments.The three patch types differed in biogeochemical activity, largely as a function of their sediment size distribution, organic content and surface-subsurface exchange dynamics. Nitrate reduction was associated with hypoxic (< 90 mu M oxygen), organically rich silt/sand deposits and, at one site, with fine gravel/sand. Nitrate reduction was related to the depth of the silt/sand, and did not occur in the deep samples (> 30 cm) that contained oxygen > 90 mu M. A high background concentration of nitrous oxide (similar to 180 nM) occurred within the river bed, regardless of patch type and depth into the bed. In the nitrate reduction zone, N2O concentration was highly variable, with production and reduction of N2O. Ammonium concentration was higher within the river bed than in surface water and decreased with depth, particularly in the organically rich silt/sand and coarse gravels, where organic matter may get trapped.From a hydrological/biogeochemicat perspective, the Lambourn differs from many other rivers. Despite being hypernutrified (surface and subsurface nitrate > 400 mu M), the bed of the Lambourn is predominantly aerobic and does not serve as a significant nitrate sink. In addition, despite the permeable geology of the catchment, biogeochemical processing of nutrients may be restricted to the thin, but biologically productive, layer in the shallow river bed sediments.

12,12,"TREMOLIERES, M",Mar 26 1993 ,THE EXCHANGE PROCESS BETWEEN RIVER AND GROUNDWATER ON THE CENTRAL ALSACE FLOODPLAIN (EASTERN FRANCE) .1. THE CASE OF THE CANALISED RIVER RHINE,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The recent canalisation (in the nineteen sixties) of the upper Rhine has modified the exchange processes between the river and its groundwater in the floodplain of Alsace. The Rhine seeps through its gravelly bed and in this way feeds the nearby groundwater table by means of the so-called 'Rhine filtrates'. Using a few groundwater stream examples, this paper presents the characterization and localisation of these infiltrations. The Rhine filtrates are characterized by a high level of chloride and a low level of nitrate, these compounds being hydrological tracers, specific for the Alsatian floodplain (chloride resulting from contamination by the potash mines in the south of Alsace). They are also defined by high levels of phosphate and mercury (very localized injection). Phosphate is responsible for eutrophication which is observable in the appearance of specific aquatic macrophyte communities. Groundwater contamination by mercury is reflected by its accumulation in the bryophyte Fontinalis antipyretica sampled in groundwater streams. Thus aquatic vegetation, and more particularly the distribution of macrophyte communities, is used as an ecological descriptor of the exchange between the Rhine and its groundwater. The maximum injection of Rhine filtrates occurs between two areas of stillwater (hydroelectric dams), where the Rhine dominates its plain and where the substrate is constituted of coarse gravels.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1993LA40700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTHE%2BEXCHANGE%2BPROCESS%2BBETWEEN%2BRIVER%2BAND%2BGROUNDWATER%2BON%2BTHE%2BCENTRAL%2BALSACE%2BFLOODPLAIN%2B%2528EASTERN%2BFRANCE%2529%2B.1.%2BTHE%2BCASE%2BOF%2BTHE%2BCANALISED%2BRIVER%2BRHINE%26rft.aufirst%3DM%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DTREMOLIERES%26rft.date%3D1993%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00014108%26rft.epage%3D148%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D133-148%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D133%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D254%26rft.au%3DTREMOLIERES%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DEGLIN%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DCARBIENER%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/BF00014108,"RIVER-GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,FLOODPLAIN,PHOSPHATE,MERCURY,MACROPHYTE COMMUNITY,CANALISED RIVER,RHINE","EUTROPHICATION,BIOINDICATORS,COMMUNITIES,WATERS,PLAIN,ZONE",,"FAC PHARM ILLKIRCH,CEREG,CNRS,URA 95,BP 24,F-67401 ILLKIRCH GRAFFENS,FRANCE"
13,13,"Barragan, VM",Feb 15 2006 ,Streaming potential across cation-exchange membranes in methanol-water electrolyte solutions,JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE,"Streaming potential measurements across charged membranes separating two equal solutions have been carried out. Two cation-exchange membranes with different cross-linked and swelling properties (Ionics and Nafion membranes) and methanol-water electrolyte solutions of KCl have been used in the experiments. The obtained results show that the streaming potential is higher for the Ionics membrane and that the values depend on the methanol content of the solutions. A different behavior is found in the dependence of the streaming potential on the methanol percentage for each membrane. The study of the relaxation times in the decay of electrokinetic steady states of streaming potential has been carried out from the time dependence of the streaming potential when the pressure difference through the membrane is suppressed. The results show the existence of two different parts or partial relaxations, mechanical and electric. A different behavior of the mechanical relaxation time with the methanol percentage has been found for the two membranes, but any significant difference between their electric relaxation times. These differences have been explained in terms of the different degree of swelling of the membranes used. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Variations in the discharge measured at four fixed gauges in the catchment, coupled with information on the length of flowing channel over the period 1983-2001, are used to describe regional patterns in flow accretion. Mean catchment accretion generally exceeds 0.15 m(3) s(-1) km(-1), but there are significant differences between perennial reaches indicating how the combination of local structural controls and seasonal changes in the drainage net affect flow accretion. Data from current meter surveys were used to determine the spatial variability in flow accretion: 505 paired observations along 12 reaches between 1 and 2.95 kin in length indicated a consistent spatial trend in accretion. Accretion was high in upstream and downstream channel reaches, and in middle reaches where dry valleys intersected the main valley. A flow accretion index was developed to describe the relationship of flow accretion in each of the 12 study reaches to catchment discharge. The relationship varied from a strong positive correlation with catchment discharge (two reaches), a weak positive correlation (three reaches), a strong negative correlation (two reaches), to no relationship to catchment discharge (four reaches). The results highlight the need to reconsider the usual assumption of uniform, or uniformly increasing, flow accretion in chalk catchments. Moreover, they emphasize the importance of catchment topography, and illustrate how flow accretion in individual reaches may vary between high and low groundwater levels.

15,15,"Xie, YQ",Sep 2017 ,Limits of heat as a tracer to quantify transient lateral river-aquifer exchanges,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The application of heat as a tracer for assessing river-aquifer exchanges has been mainly limited to vertical flow through the riverbed. Lateral river-aquifer exchanges become more important than vertical riverbed exchanges if the river is deeply incised into an aquifer. Few studies have examined lateral river-aquifer exchanges and the ability of heat to constrain such exchanges. This study aims to perform a robust assessment of the limits of heat as a tracer to quantify lateral river-aquifer exchanges. The study is based on a section of the Meuse River in Belgium, a river predominantly gaining in the studied area and becoming intermittently losing in the winter time. A calibrated transect model shows that river temperature can affect groundwater temperature up to 9 m into the aquifer. An accompanying synthetic modeling investigation using Monte Carlo simulation shows that heat data for distances between 4 and 9 m from the river can reduce the uncertainty of river-aquifer exchanges for conditions similar to those of the transect model. The ability of heat to reduce the river-aquifer exchange uncertainty improves with distance from the river because of the reduction in the number of acceptable model realizations. The optimal distance is 8 m from the river where the groundwater temperature is no longer affected by the river temperature. The synthetic modeling also indicates that heat alone cannot constrain river-aquifer exchanges better than the commonly used hydraulic head. However, when combined with hydraulic head, heat can significantly reduce the uncertainty of river-aquifer lateral exchanges under gaining conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000413484200014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLimits%2Bof%2Bheat%2Bas%2Ba%2Btracer%2Bto%2Bquantify%2Btransient%2Blateral%2Briver-aquifer%2Bexchanges%26rft.aufirst%3DYueqing%26rft.auinit%3DYQ%26rft.aulast%3DXie%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR021120%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7755%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7740-7755%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7740%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DXie%252C%2BYQ%26rft.au%3DBatlle-Aguilar%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2017WR021120,"heat as a tracer,groundwater-surface water interaction,lateral river-aquifer exchanges,urban hydrogeology,artificial riverbank","SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,TIME-SERIES MEASUREMENTS,GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,SEDIMENT TEMPERATURE,STREAM TEMPERATURE,FLOW,DYNAMICS,MODEL,ZONE,FLUX",,"Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Natl Ctr Groundwater Res & Training, Adelaide, SA, Australia"
16,16,"Romeijn, P",Apr 20 2021 ,Macrophyte Controls on Urban Stream Microbial Metabolic Activity,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Urban rivers worldwide are affected directly by macrophyte growth, causing reduced flow velocity and risks of flooding. Therefore, cutting macrophytes is a common management practice to ensure free drainage. The impacts of macrophyte removal on transient storage dynamics and microbial metabolic activity of wastewater-fed urban streams are unknown, preventing any assessment of the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical consequences of this management practice. Slug tracer injections were performed with the conservative tracer uranine and the reactive tracer resazurin to quantify the implications of macrophyte cutting on stream flow dynamics and metabolism. Macrophyte cutting reduced mean tracer arrival times in managed stream reaches but did not significantly decrease whole-stream microbial metabolic activity. In fact, transient storage indices were found to have increased after cutting, suggesting that macrophyte removal and the resulting increase in flow velocity may have enhanced hyporheic exchange flow through streambed sediments. Our results evidence that macrophyte cutting in nutrient-rich urban streams does not necessarily lead to lower in-stream storage and metabolism but that the gain in hyporheic exchange and streambed microbial metabolic activity can compensate for reduced in-stream storage. Increased stream flow resulting from macrophyte removal may therefore even enhance nutrient and pollutant attenuation capacity of streambed sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000643546400039,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMacrophyte%2BControls%2Bon%2BUrban%2BStream%2BMicrobial%2BMetabolic%2BActivity%26rft.aufirst%3DPaul%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DRomeijn%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Facs.est.0c02854%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D4596%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4585-4596%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4585%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DRomeijn%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DHannah%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1021/acs.est.0c02854,,"AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT,REACTIVE TRACER TESTS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES,WATER MANAGEMENT,LOWLAND RIVER,FLOW,COMMUNITIES,FLUOROMETRY",,"Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England"
17,17,"Kim, H",Apr 2019 ,Culturable bacteria diversity in surface water-groundwater exchange zones by 16S rRNA gene analysis,JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA,"This study identified 16S rRNA genes using PCR to find out culturable microorganisms living in the samples of surface water, surface water-groundwater exchange zones (hyporheic zones), ground water collected in the Haean bain, Yanggu-gun, Gangwon-do. Bacterial count of culturable microorganisms was 2.5x10(5) CFU/ml in the hyporheic water, which was over 10 times higher than those in the surface water and the ground water. Moreover, measurements of bacterial counts by separation into aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms found 10-100 times more aerobic bacteria than anaerobic bacteria. Identification through sequencing of 16S rRNA gene resulted in 40 genera of aerobic bacteria and 21 genera of anaerobic bacteria in the hyporheic water. Of the aerobic bacteria, the Pseudomonas genus was most dominant with about 29.3% in proportion, followed by the Flavobacterium genus with about 15.3%. Excluding genera separated from the surface water and the ground water, a total of 31 aerobic genera and 16 anaerobic genera were identified in the hyporheic water. It is expected that a comparative analysis between metagenomics data obtained from samples in the hyporheic water by pyrosequencing and culturable microorganisms of the present study should be able to provide more solid fundamental data on physiological characteristics and roles of microorganisms living in hyporheic zones and would enable to conduct more quantitative study.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000467085900007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCulturable%2Bbacteria%2Bdiversity%2Bin%2Bsurface%2Bwater-groundwater%2Bexchange%2Bzones%2Bby%2B16S%2BrRNA%2Bgene%2Banalysis%26rft.aufirst%3DHeejung%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DKim%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.14770%252Fjgsk.2019.55.2.237%26rft.eissn%3D2288-7377%26rft.epage%3D246%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0435-4036%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BGEOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%2BOF%2BKOREA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D237-246%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D237%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOL%2BSOC%2BKOREA%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DKim%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BJY%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BKK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+GEOLOGICAL+SOCIETY+OF+KOREA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.14770/jgsk.2019.55.2.237,"surface water-groundwater exchange zones (hyporheic),culturable bacteria,16S rRNA","HYPORHEIC-ZONE,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,HAEAN BASIN,COMMUNITY,CONTAMINATION,BIOFILMS,RIVERS",,"Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea"
18,18,"Akhtar, N",Feb 2022 ,Upscaling of Surface Water and Groundwater Interactions in Hyporheic Zone from Local to Regional Scale,WATER,"The groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) interaction (SW-GW) through the hyporheic zone is a significant component in sustainable water resource management. The complexities in SW-GW interactions increase from a local to a regional scale and are affected by variation in hydraulic, hydrologic, and hydrogeologic (3H) processes. Controlling factors and their upscaling of these processes to assess SW-GW interaction have not been addressed sufficiently in previous studies. Additionally, it is unclear what the effective factors are at different scales during the upscaling. Therefore, the present review focused on controlling factors of 3H processes in SW-GW interaction and their upscaling techniques. Relevancy of controlling factors was identified at different scales. Applications of different approaches and their uncertainties were also discussed for the characterization of SW-GW interactions. The study revealed that the improved data from different approaches is crucial for machine learning training and its application in the SW and GW assessment at local, sub-catchment, and catchment scales. Based on the outcomes, a framework has been proposed to execute modalities of controlling factors using remote sensing, geophysics, and artificial intelligence. The proposed framework could help in handling big data and accurate upscaling for water resource management.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000764309000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B647%26rft.atitle%3DUpscaling%2Bof%2BSurface%2BWater%2Band%2BGroundwater%2BInteractions%2Bin%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bfrom%2BLocal%2Bto%2BRegional%2BScale%26rft.aufirst%3DNaseem%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DAkhtar%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw14040647%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DAkhtar%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DSyakir%252C%2BMI%26rft.au%3DYusuff%252C%2BMSM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w14040647,"surface water,groundwater,hyporheic exchange,hyporheic zone,upscaling","FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,STREAMBED HETEROGENEITY,DAILY PRECIPITATION,AQUIFER INTERACTION,FIELD-MEASUREMENTS,SPATIAL ESTIMATION,RIVER BATHYMETRY,CONJUNCTIVE USE,EXCHANGE",,"Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Ind Technol, Minden 11800, Malaysia"
19,19,"Cheng, ZL",Jul 2022 ,Recession and hysteresis effects of hyporheic zone permeability changes on baseflow in seasonal freeze-thaw mountainous areas,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Baseflow is the main groundwater discharge mode from mountainous areas to rivers and is an important component of river runoff. Temperature changes in the hyporheic zone in seasonal freeze-thaw areas cause changes in its permeability, which then affect the recession of baseflow. It is critical to study underground surface water transformation processes in cold regions to explore baseflow recession and hysteresis effects caused by permeability changes in the hyporheic zone under variable temperatures. In this study, we investigated the Hanyangtun Basin in the Changbai Mountain District to determine the functional relationship between permeability and temperature in the hyporheic zone using theoretical analysis combined with laboratory saturated permeability experiments using medium-and fine-grained sand at variable temperatures. We then calculated and analyzed the recession amplitude and hysteresis time of the baseflow caused by permeability changes in the hyporheic zone of this freeze-thaw mountainous area using water temperature and reference baseflow data. The results indicate that owing to large temperature changes in the study area, the permeability of the hyporheic zone changed substantially. Lower permeability leads to the blocking of groundwater discharging to surface water, i. e., the baseflow hysteresis effect. The recession amplitude of the baseflow caused by lower permeability increased with decreasing temperatures, reaching a maximum of 41.67%. The groundwater discharge hysteresis time increased with decreasing temperature. The hysteresis effect was most obvious during the stable melting period, with a maximum hysteresis time of 16 days, while the total annual hysteresis time was 60 days. This study provides a new perspective for qualitative and quantitative studies of the relationship between groundwater and surface water in the mountainous areas that experience seasonal freeze-thaw.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000807294200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B127925%26rft.atitle%3DRecession%2Band%2Bhysteresis%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bpermeability%2Bchanges%2Bon%2Bbaseflow%2Bin%2Bseasonal%2Bfreeze-thaw%2Bmountainous%2Bareas%26rft.aufirst%3DZhongle%26rft.auinit%3DZL%26rft.aulast%3DCheng%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2022.127925%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D610%26rft.au%3DCheng%252C%2BZL%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BFG%26rft.au%3DYu%252C%2BCT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127925,"Hyporheic zone,Seasonal freeze-thaw area,Changbai Mountains,Baseflow,Hysteresis effect,Permeability change","GROUNDWATER,VISCOSITY,BASIN,SOIL,ALGORITHM,EXCHANGE,RECHARGE,STREAM,FLOW",,"2519 Jiefang Rd, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China"

Here we present a combined experimental-numerical study to explain physical processes involved in disconnected stream-aquifer systems. A stream-aquifer sand box was built to measure the infiltration rate through the stream bed during aquifer drainage. The pressures in the saturated zone of the aquifer and the infiltration rate were measured in order to quantify the fluid flow in this system. The transient transitional stage between connected and disconnected flow regimes, which was obtained experimentally, is characterised by a maximum infiltration rate across the stream bed before a decrease towards a constant value. This behaviour is analysed by means of transient numerical simulations using relevant hydrodynamic parameters. The importance of the drainage kinematics and unsaturated zone parameters for the temporal variation of the infiltration rate is demonstrated.

21,21,"Costa, D",Dec 2016 ,Coupling spatially distributed river and groundwater transport models to investigate contaminant dynamics at river corridor scales,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,"Rivers and aquifers are mutually dependent components of the hydrological cycle, typically characterised by temporal dynamics that are a few orders of magnitude apart. This characteristic is often advocated to justify the use of independent single-system models to maximise the outcome for the available computational resources. However, the rapid increase in computational power presently provides means to explore new and more complex modelling schemes, which better reflect the complex physical reality. We present a new modelling framework, FLUXOS, developed from the full coupling of modified versions of state-of-the-art standalone river and groundwater flow and transport models. The model is validated against analytical solutions and applied to real world scenarios in the complex urban corridor of the Ciliwung River in Jakarta to show its flexibility for practical applications and its capabilities as an exploratory tool for realistic investigation of contamination sources and pathways determining nonlinear behaviours of river-aquifer interactions.

22,22,"Irawan, DE",Feb 2015 ,"Groundwater-surface water interactions of Ciliwung River streams, segment Bogor-Jakarta, Indonesia",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"CiliwungRiver water quality and its vicinity have been continuously degraded with the increasing population. The objective of this research is to understand the association between river and groundwater, and the water quality profile. Field measurements ware taken from 65 stations from Bogor to Jakarta. Water level, temperature, pH, and TDS were measured to build the water flow map and hydrochemical profile. Small-scale geoelectrical survey was conducted at five locations to capture the aquifer's geometry. We identified three types of stream relationships between river and groundwater: effluent from Bogor to Katulampa (Segment 1), perched at the University of Indonesia (UI) area (Segment 2), and influent from UI to Muara (Segment 3), with low gradient from <0.1 to 0.3. The temperature profile of river and groundwater shows similar pattern as well as TDS profile. All similarities support close connection of river and groundwater. The increasing TDS towards downstream shows increasing enrichment and contamination. The erratic pattern of pH indicates chemical instability due to high contamination. This study highlights the benefit of understanding the hydrodynamic relationship between river water and groundwater. Such interaction triggers water quality exchange between both water bodies. Therefore, a similar study should also be done on other riverbanks in Indonesia to protect water quality.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000348340900030,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Binteractions%2Bof%2BCiliwung%2BRiver%2Bstreams%252C%2Bsegment%2BBogor-Jakarta%252C%2BIndonesia%26rft.aufirst%3DD.%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DDE%26rft.aulast%3DIrawan%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-014-3482-4%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.epage%3D1302%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1295-1302%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1295%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D73%26rft.au%3DIrawan%252C%2BDE%26rft.au%3DSilaen%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DPuradimaja%252C%2BDJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-014-3482-4,"River-groundwater interaction,Hydrodynamic,Hydrochemistry Ciliwung River","KATHMANDU VALLEY,NEPAL",,"Inst Teknol Bandung, Fac Earth Sci & Technol, Appl Geol Res Grp, Jl Ganesa 10, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia"
23,23,"Frei, S",Sep 15 2009 ,Patterns and dynamics of river-aquifer exchange with variably-saturated flow using a fully-coupled model,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The parallel physically-based surface-subsurface model PARFLOW was used to investigate the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of river-aquifer exchange in a heterogeneous alluvial river-aquifer system with deep water table. Aquifer heterogeneity at two scales was incorporated into the model. The architecture of the alluvial hydrofacies was represented based on conditioned geostatistical indicator simulations. Subscale variability of hydraulic conductivities (K) within hydrofacies bodies was created with a parallel Gaussian simulation. The effects of subscale heterogeneity were investigated in a Monte Carlo framework. Dynamics and patterns of river-aquifer exchange were simulated for a 30-day flow event. Simulation results show the rapid formation of saturated connections between the river channel and the deep water table at preferential flow zones that are characterized by high conductivity hydrofacies. Where the river intersects low conductivity hydrofacies shallow perched saturated zones immediately below the river form, but seepage to the deep water table remains unsaturated and seepage rates are low. Preferential flow zones, although only taking up around 50% of the river channel, account for more than 98% of total seepage. Groundwater recharge is most efficiently realized through these zones. Subscale variability of K-sat slightly increased seepage volumes, but did not change the general seepage patterns (preferential flow zones versus perched zones). Overall it is concluded that typical alluvial heterogeneity (hydrofacies architecture) is an important control of river-aquifer exchange in rivers overlying deep water tables. Simulated patterns and dynamics are in line with field observations and results from previous modeling studies using simpler models. Alluvial heterogeneity results in distinct patterns and dynamics of river-aquifer exchange with implications for groundwater recharge and the management of riparian zones (e.g. river channel-floodplain connectivity via saturated zones).

Given the coupling of high-frequency hydraulic head gradient and temperature measurements, its innovation when compared to currently available monitoring systems is to operate under transient conditions and to allow the quantification of coupled water and heat exchanges with an unprecented fine temporal resolution, such as the rainfall event time scale. The LOMOS-mini is low-cost, easy to construct from individual microelectronic components and has an autonomy of several months in the field. Its robust implementation protocol makes it suitable for a wide variety of geological environments, from soft loamy, sandy, clayey streambeds to compact colluvial environments. Hydraulic head gradients are measured using the pressure sensor technology presented in Greswell et al. (2009). The sensibility of pressure estimates to ambient temperature is demonstrated; the measurement error is evaluated to decrease by up to one order of magnitude when accounting for temperature in the calibration relationship. Coupled with a physically-based hydrothermal model, the LOMOS-mini provides transient estimates of vertically distributed Darcy fluxes, conductive and advective heat fluxes. The methodology is illustrated on a colluvial streambed case study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the framework of a LIFE+ European restoration program, we have investigated the potential for airborne thermal-infrared remote sensing to map surface water-groundwater exchanges and to identify their driving factors. We focused our attention on anastomosing channels on an artificial island of the Upper Rhine River (Rohrschollen), where a new channel was excavated from the floodplain to reconnect an older channel in its upstream part. These hydraulic engineering works led to an increased inflow from the Rhine Canal. Here, we propose an original data treatment chain to (a) georeference the thermal-infrared images in geographic information system based on visible images, (b) detect and correct data errors, and (c) identify and locate thermal anomalies attributed to groundwater inputs and hyporheic upwellings. Our results, which have been compared to morpho-sedimentary data, show that groundwater upwelling in the new channel is controlled by riffle-pool sequences and bars. This channel is characterized by large bedload transport and morphodynamic activity, forming riffles and bars. In the old channel, where riffle-pool sequences no longer exist, due to impacts of engineering works and insufficient morphodynamic effects of the restoration, thermal anomalies appeared to be less pronounced. Groundwater inputs seem to be controlled by former gravel bars outcropping on the banks, as well as by local thinning of the low-permeability clogging layer on the channel bed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000394901800012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThermal-infrared%2Bremote%2Bsensing%2Bof%2Bsurface%2Bwater-groundwater%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Ba%2Brestored%2Banastomosing%2Bchannel%2B%2528Upper%2BRhine%2BRiver%252C%2BFrance%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DDavid%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DEschbach%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.11100%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D1124%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1113-1124%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1113%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DEschbach%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DPiasny%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DSerradj%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.11100,"airborne thermal-infrared (TIR) remote sensing,functional restoration,hydromorphology,hyporheic processes,Upper Rhine anastomosing channel","STREAM TEMPERATURE,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,LOTIC ECOSYSTEMS,FLOW,DYNAMICS,SALMON,HETEROGENEITY,PATTERNS,GEOMORPHOLOGY,CONNECTIVITY",,"Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, LIVE UMR 7362, LTER Zone Atelier Environm Urbaine, 3 Rue Argonne, F-67083 Strasbourg, France"

Despite the presence of mountain streams worldwide, we lack basic understanding of gas exchange through their turbulent surfaces, making global estimates of outgassing from streams and rivers difficult to constrain. Here we combine new estimates of gas transfer velocities from tracer gas additions in mountain streams with published data to cover streams differing in geomorphology and hydraulics. We find two different scaling relationships between the turbulence-induced energy dissipation rate and gas transfer velocity for low- and high-channel slope streams, indicating that gas exchange in streams exists in two states. We suggest that turbulent diffusion drives gas transfer velocity in low-energy streams; whereas turbulence entrains air bubbles in high-energy streams, and the resulting bubble-mediated gas exchange accelerates with energy dissipation rate. Gas transfer velocities in the high-energy streams are among the highest reported. Our findings offer a framework to include mountain streams in future estimates of gas fluxes from streams and rivers at the global scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000462621700010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDistinct%2Bair-water%2Bgas%2Bexchange%2Bregimes%2Bin%2Blow-%2Band%2Bhigh-energy%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAmber%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DUlseth%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41561-019-0324-8%26rft.eissn%3D1752-0908%26rft.epage%3D%252B%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1752-0894%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURE%2BGEOSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D259-%252B%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D259%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BGEOSCI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DUlseth%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO%26rft.au%3DBattin%252C%2BTJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=NATURE+GEOSCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1038/s41561-019-0324-8,,"CARBON-DIOXIDE,TRANSFER VELOCITY,NONUNIFORM FLOW,CO2 EVASION,REAERATION,METABOLISM,DYNAMICS,STEEP,REGRESSION,TURBULENCE",,"Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Stream Biofilm & Ecosyst Res Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland"
27,27,"Godsey, SE",Nov 15 2014 ,"Dynamic, discontinuous stream networks: hydrologically driven variations in active drainage density, flowing channels and stream order",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Despite decades of research on the ecological consequences of stream network expansion, contraction and fragmentation, surprisingly little is known about the hydrological mechanisms that shape these processes. Here, we present field surveys of the active drainage networks of four California headwater streams (4-27km(2)) spanning diverse topographic, geologic and climatic settings. We show that these stream networks dynamically expand, contract, disconnect and reconnect across all the sites we studied. Stream networks at all four sites contract and disconnect during seasonal flow recessions, with their total active network length, and thus their active drainage densities, decreasing by factors of two to three across the range of flows captured in our field surveys. The total flowing lengths of the active stream networks are approximate power-law functions of unit discharge, with scaling exponents averaging 0.27 +/- 0.04 (range: 0.18-0.40). The number of points where surface flow originates obey similar power-law relationships, as do the lengths and origination points of flowing networks that are continuously connected to the outlet, with scaling exponents averaging 0.36-0.48. Even stream order shifts seasonally by up to two Strahler orders in our study catchments. Broadly, similar stream length scaling has been observed in catchments spanning widely varying geologic, topographic and climatic settings and spanning more than two orders of magnitude in size, suggesting that network extension/contraction is a general phenomenon that may have a general explanation. Points of emergence or disappearance of surface flow represent the balance between subsurface transmissivity in the hyporheic zone and the delivery of water from upstream. Thus the dynamics of stream network expansion and contraction, and connection and disconnection, may offer important clues to the spatial structure of the hyporheic zone, and to patterns and processes of runoff generation.

28,28,"Naegeli, MW",Sep 1996 ,Ground penetrating radar for assessing sediment structures in the hyporheic zone of a prealpine river,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used to investigate the structure of the sediments in a floodprone gravel-bed river. Measurements were made on 2 gravel bars and in the adjacent channel. We buried a metallic object to calibrate depth and to visualize changes in GPR-profiles taken before and after digging. In addition, along 2 GPR-profiles the structure of the alluvial sediment of a gravel bar was visually verified by digging a trench down to the groundwater table. The GPR method enables,ne to distinguish sedimentary units of different texture with a vertical resolution of about 0.25 m. The investigation showed the depth of the alluvial valley fill, and it revealed geomorphological features such as lateral point bar accretion, fills of former pools, or open framework textures. These structures form a complex 3-dimensional mosaic of sediment patches. The GPR method also allowed us to document the changes resulting from bed-moving floods, such as in the formation of homogeneous gravel sheets during high magnitude floods. At some sites we observed intercalations of coarse organic matter between adjacent sedimentary units. Based on GPR data and the analysis of geomorphological structures near the study site, we developed a diagrammatic model of the sediments of this site in the lower Necker Valley.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1996VG35800007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGround%2Bpenetrating%2Bradar%2Bfor%2Bassessing%2Bsediment%2Bstructures%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bprealpine%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DMW%26rft.auinit%3DMW%26rft.aulast%3DNaegeli%26rft.date%3D1996%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1467282%26rft.epage%3D366%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D353-366%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D353%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DNaegeli%252C%2BMW%26rft.au%3DHuggenberger%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DUehlinger%252C%2BU&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1467282,"hyporheic zone,ground penetrating radar,gravel bar,sediment structure,texture,flood,prealpine river,Switzerland","DESERT STREAM ECOSYSTEM,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,INTEGRATING HYDROLOGY,WATER,PERSPECTIVE,DYNAMICS,FLOW,METABOLISM,DEPOSITS,PATTERNS",,"SWISS FED INST ENVIRONM SCI & TECHNOL,CH-8600 DUBENDORF,SWITZERLAND"
29,29,"Ward, AS",Sep 2013 ,How does rapidly changing discharge during storm events affect transient storage and channel water balance in a headwater mountain stream?,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Measurements of transient storage in coupled surface-water and groundwater systems are widely made during base flow periods and rarely made during storm flow periods. We completed 24 sets of slug injections in three contiguous study reaches during a 1.25 year return interval storm event (discharge ranging from 21.5 to 434 L s(-1)) in a net gaining headwater stream within a steep, constrained valley. Repeated studies over a 9 day period characterize transient storage and channel water from prestorm conditions through storm discharge recession. Although the valley floor was always gaining from the hillslopes based on hydraulic gradients, we observed exchange of water from the stream to the valley floor throughout the study and flow conditions. Interpretations of transient storage and channel water balance are complicated by dynamic in-stream and near-stream processes. Metrics of transient storage and channel water balance were significantly different (95% confidence level) between the three study reaches and could be identified independently of stream discharge via analysis of normalized breakthrough curves. These differences suggest that the morphology of each study reach was the primary control on solute tracer transport. Unlike discharge, metrics of transient storage and channel water balance did not return to the prestorm values. We conclude that discharge alone is a poor predictor of tracer transport in stream networks during storm events. Finally, we propose a perceptual model for our study site that links hydrologic dynamics in 3-D along the hillslope-riparian-hyporheic-stream continuum, including down-valley subsurface transport.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000325991100027,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2Bdoes%2Brapidly%2Bchanging%2Bdischarge%2Bduring%2Bstorm%2Bevents%2Baffect%2Btransient%2Bstorage%2Band%2Bchannel%2Bwater%2Bbalance%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bmountain%2Bstream%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DAS%26rft.aulast%3DWard%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20434%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D5486%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5473-5486%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5473%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/wrcr.20434,"solute transport,channel water balance,modeling,transient storage,hyporheic,storm","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE FLOW,SANTA-CLARA COUNTY,COBBLE-BED STREAM,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MASS-TRANSFER,UVAS CREEK,ZONE,GROUNDWATER,DYNAMICS,MODELS",,"Univ Iowa, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 36 Trowbridge Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA"
30,30,"Rodriguez-Ramos, JA",Aug 30 2022 ,Genome-Resolved Metaproteomics Decodes the Microbial and Viral Contributions to Coupled Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling in River Sediments,MSYSTEMS,"Rivers have a significant role in global carbon and nitrogen cycles, serving as a nexus for nutrient transport between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Although rivers have a small global surface area, they contribute substantially to worldwide greenhouse gas emissions through microbially mediated processes within the river hyporheic zone. Despite this importance, research linking microbial and viral communities to specific biogeochemical reactions is still nascent in these sediment environments. To survey the metabolic potential and gene expression underpinning carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in river sediments, we collected an integrated data set of 33 metagenomes, metaproteomes, and paired metabolomes. We reconstructed over 500 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), which we dereplicated into 55 unique, nearly complete medium- and high-quality MAGs spanning 12 bacterial and archaeal phyla. We also reconstructed 2,482 viral genomic contigs, which were dereplicated into 111 viral MAGs (vMAGs) of >10 kb in size. As a result of integrating gene expression data with geochemical and metabolite data, we created a conceptual model that uncovered new roles for microorganisms in organic matter decomposition, carbon sequestration, nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification. We show how these metabolic pathways, integrated through shared resource pools of ammonium, carbon dioxide, and inorganic nitrogen, could ultimately contribute to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes from hyporheic sediments. Further, by linking viral MAGs to these active microbial hosts, we provide some of the first insights into viral modulation of river sediment carbon and nitrogen cycling.IMPORTANCE Here we created HUM-V (hyporheic uncultured microbial and viral), an annotated microbial and viral MAG catalog that captures strain and functional diversity encoded in these Columbia River sediment samples. Demonstrating its utility, this genomic inventory encompasses multiple representatives of dominant microbial and archaeal phyla reported in other river sediments and provides novel viral MAGs that can putatively infect these. Furthermore, we used HUM-V to recruit gene expression data to decipher the functional activities of these MAGs and reconstruct their active roles in Columbia River sediment biogeochemical cycling. Ultimately, we show the power of MAG-resolved multi-omics to uncover interactions and chemical handoffs in river sediments that shape an intertwined carbon and nitrogen metabolic network. The accessible microbial and viral MAGs in HUM-V will serve as a community resource to further advance more untargeted, activity-based measurements in these, and related, freshwater terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000830006500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B00516-22%26rft.atitle%3DGenome-Resolved%2BMetaproteomics%2BDecodes%2Bthe%2BMicrobial%2Band%2BViral%2BContributions%2Bto%2BCoupled%2BCarbon%2Band%2BNitrogen%2BCycling%2Bin%2BRiver%2BSediments%26rft.aufirst%3DJosue%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DJA%26rft.aulast%3DRodriguez-Ramos%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1128%252Fmsystems.00516-22%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2379-5077%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DMSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DMSYSTEMS%26rft.volume%3D7%26rft.au%3DRodriguez-Ramos%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DBorton%252C%2BMA%26rft.au%3DWrighton%252C%2BKC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=MSYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1128/msystems.00516-22,"hyporheic zone,Binatia,microbiome,metagenomics,mineralization,greenhouse gas,viruses,auxiliary metabolic genes,Thermoproteota","HYPORHEIC ZONE,ORGANIC-MATTER,PREDICTION,NITRIFICATION,BACTERIAL,ALIGNMENT,FLOW,TOOL,CO2",,"Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA"

The experimental wells receiving conservative (Cl- and Br) and reactive ((NO3-)-N-15) solute tracers had hyporheic median residence times of 7.0 to 13.1 h, nominal flowpath lengths of 0.7 to 3.7 m, and hypoxic conditions (<1.5 mg O-2 L-1). All receiving wells demonstrated N-15(2) production during ambient conditions, indicating that the hyporheic zone was an environment with active denitrification. The subsequent addition of AcO- stimulated more denitrification as evidenced by significant delta N-15(2) increases by factors of 2.7 to 26.1 in receiving wells and significant decreases of NO3- and DO in the two wells most hydrologically connected to the injection. The rate of nitrate removal in the hyporheic zone increased from 218 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) to 521 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) under elevated AcO- conditions. In all receiving wells, increases of bromide and N-15(2) occurred without concurrent increases in AcO-, indicating that 100% of AcO- was retained or lost in the hyporheic zone. These results support the hypothesis that denitrification in anaerobic portions of the hyporheic zone is limited by labile DOC supply.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000298747800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG04036%26rft.atitle%3DLabile%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bsupply%2Blimits%2Bhyporheic%2Bdenitrification%26rft.aufirst%3DJay%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DZarnetske%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011JG001730%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D116%26rft.au%3DZarnetske%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DHaggerty%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DBaker%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2011JG001730,,"STREAM ECOSYSTEM,MOUNTAIN STREAM,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,HEADWATER STREAMS,NITRATE REMOVAL,DESERT STREAM,RICH STREAM,ZONE,METABOLISM,SEDIMENTS",,"Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06513 USA"
32,32,"Rathore, SS",May 2021 ,On the Reliability of Parameter Inferences in a Multiscale Model for Transport in Stream Corridors,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Nonreacting tracer tests capture information about physical processes in transient storage zones including the hyporheic zone (HZ). However, reliably extracting this information from breakthrough curves (BTCs) and distinguishing the effects of in-channel dispersion and transient storage are well-known challenges. Using BTCs from a nonreacting tracer test monitored at multiple locations, we explore ways for reliable parameter estimations. The identifiability of parameters is greatly influenced by the choice of forward and inverse modeling frameworks in addition to the quality of the data. Our forward model is a recently proposed multiscale model that uses subgrid transport models written in the Lagrangian form to represent transport along a diverse set of HZ pathways with a shape-free distribution of travel times. Joint distributions of HZ and channel parameters are estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. Numerical experiments show ambiguity between channel dispersion and HZ transport when the reach length is too short to allow significant solute-HZ interaction, the observation period is too brief to observe the tailing behavior, or the solute source is spread in time. In contrast, we obtained reliable parameter estimates by simultaneously fitting BTCs observed at different locations in the test reach using a single set of HZ parameters and section-specific channel areas and dispersion coefficients. This study demonstrates the estimation of travel time distributions, HZ exchange rates, and channel parameters in a new multiscale approach and offers guidance for extracting reliable parameter estimates from multiple BTCs.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000654464300056,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028908%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2Bthe%2BReliability%2Bof%2BParameter%2BInferences%2Bin%2Ba%2BMultiscale%2BModel%2Bfor%2BTransport%2Bin%2BStream%2BCorridors%26rft.aufirst%3DSaubhagya%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DSS%26rft.aulast%3DRathore%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028908%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DRathore%252C%2BSS%26rft.au%3DJan%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DPainter%252C%2BSL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR028908,"hyporheic zone,modeling,parameter estimation,stream corridor","TRANSIENT STORAGE MODEL,REACTIVE TRACER TESTS,CONTAMINATED STREAM,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,NONSORBING SOLUTES,RESIDENCE TIME,SURFACE-WATER,RIVER,ZONE,TEMPERATURE",,"Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, POB 2008, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA"
33,33,"Wang, XY",Dec 2017 ,Maintaining the connected river-lake relationship in the middle Yangtze River reaches after completion of the Three Gorges Project,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH,"After operation of the Three Gorges Project (TGP), there is a new evolution tendency for rivers and lakes in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (i.e. the Ching River reaches). In recent years, the weakening connection relationship between the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake has resulted in a series of problems for flood regulation, water resources utilization, and aquatic ecosystem protection in the river-lake joint area. In this paper, the hydrological characteristics and fluvial processes within the river-lake joint area are studied, and possible management strategies to maintain the connected river-lake relationship are proposed. To achieve this objective, the evolution tendency, such as the zero-flow problem and river regime for three major outlets (i.e. the Songzi Outlet, Taiping Outlet, and Ouchi Outlet) to Dongting Lake from the Yangtze River, is analyzed. It is believed that the Songzi Outlet has a comparative advantage in flow diversion over the other two outlets. The Range of Variability Approach is introduced to identify hydrological characteristics at the Songzi Outlet. Several characteristic values of flow diversion from this outlet during drought periods are determined. Then, the fluvial processes in the river-lake joint area are studied by comparing topographic maps and using control gauge station data of various years. The water and sediment flux are analyzed before and after operation of the TGP. Finally, based on the results obtained, two possible management strategies are recommended and corresponding parameters are estimated to strengthen and maintain the connected river-lake relationship. This analysis takes into account operation of the TGP, mainstream shift and increasing riverbed scour in the Ching River channel. To restore the flow diversion condition to that in the 1950s or 1960s (i.e. 140 m(3)/s of flow diversion corresponding to 5500 m(3)/s of flow at the Zhicheng station), it is estimated that the river channel around the Songzi Outlet should be dredged 1.4 m under the current riverbed situation, and other corresponding improvement measures for Songzi River channels should also be implemented.

The boron adsorbed on the ion exchange column was at a flow rate of about 1 cm(3) min(-1) washed with 20 cm(3) of 1 mol dm(-3) nitric acid, and then eluted with 20 cm(3) of 6.5 mol dm(-3) nitric acid. After the effluent was collected in a 100 cm(3) quartz beaker, 10 cm(3) of 1.47 mol dm(-3) H3PO4 was added and evaporated to about 2 cm(3) on a hotplate. Any organic materials in the affluent were decomposed with mixed H3PO4-HClO4-HNO3. The content in the beaker was then transfered a 25 cm(3) PTFE standard flask, and diluted to the mark with water. The boron contents were determined by ICP-AES(182.6 nm). The present method was successfully applied to the analysis of standard reference materials(JAC0032) and to samples from Doshi river. The determination of boron in the standard reference materials showed good agreement and precision with already published values. The boron contents in the upper, middle and lower reaches in the river were 3.5 +/- 0.1 mug/l (n = 3), 5.1 +/- 0.1 mug/l (n = 6) and 9.4 +/- 0.6 mug/l (n = 4), respectively.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000167681300008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDetermination%2Bof%2Bboron%2Bin%2Briver-water%2Bby%2BICP-AES%2Bcoupled%2Bwith%2Banion-exchange%2Bpreconcentration%26rft.aufirst%3DN%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DYoshikuni%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2116%252Fbunsekikagaku.50.203%26rft.epage%3D208%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0525-1931%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBUNSEKI%2BKAGAKU%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D203-208%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D203%26rft.stitle%3DBUNSEKI%2BKAGAKU%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DYoshikuni%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DSeki%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DOguma%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=BUNSEKI+KAGAKU&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2116/bunsekikagaku.50.203,"boron,ion exchange,ICP-AES",ATOMIC EMISSION-SPECTROMETRY,,"Chiba Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Technol, Inage Ku, 1-33 Yayoi Cho, Chiba 2638522, Japan"
35,35,"Heindel, RC",Feb 2021 ,"Diatoms in Hyporheic Sediments Trace Organic Matter Retention and Processing in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"In low-nutrient streams in cold and arid ecosystems, the spiraling of autochthonous particulate organic matter (POM) may provide important nutrient subsidies downstream. Because of its lability and the spatial heterogeneity of processing in hyporheic sediments, the downstream transport and fate of autochthonous POM can be difficult to trace. In Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valley (MDV) streams, any POM retained in the hyporheic zone is expected to be derived from surface microbial mats that contain diatoms with long-lasting silica frustules. We tested whether diatom frustules can be used to trace the retention of autochthonous POM in the hyporheic zone and whether certain geomorphic locations promote this process. The accumulation of diatom frustules in hyporheic sediments, measured as biogenic silica, was correlated with loss-on-ignition organic matter and sorbed ammonium, suggesting that diatoms can be used to identify locations where POM has been retained and processed over long timescales, regardless of whether the POM remains intact. In addition, by modeling the upstream sources of hyporheic diatom assemblages, we found that POM was predominantly derived from N-fixing microbial mats of the genus Nostoc. In terms of spatial variability, we conclude that the hyporheic sediments adjacent to the stream channel that are regularly inundated by daily flood pulses are where the most POM has been retained over long timescales. Autochthonous POM is retained in hyporheic zones of low-nutrient streams beyond the MDVs, and we suggest that biogenic silica and diatom composition can be used to identify locations where this transfer is most prevalent.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000624413700016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020JG006097%26rft.atitle%3DDiatoms%2Bin%2BHyporheic%2BSediments%2BTrace%2BOrganic%2BMatter%2BRetention%2Band%2BProcessing%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMcMurdo%2BDry%2BValleys%252C%2BAntarctica%26rft.aufirst%3DRuth%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DRC%26rft.aulast%3DHeindel%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020JG006097%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D126%26rft.au%3DHeindel%252C%2BRC%26rft.au%3DDarling%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020JG006097,"benthic processes,biogeochemical cycles,processes,and modeling,carbon cycling,groundwater,surface water interactions,nitrogen cycling,biogenic silica,diatoms,hyporheic zone,McMurdo Dry Valleys,particulate organic matter","VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,NITROGEN DYNAMICS,MELTWATER STREAMS,TAYLOR VALLEY,LAKE FRYXELL,ZONE,COMMUNITIES,METABOLISM,AMMONIUM",,"Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA"
36,36,"Stewardson, MJ",Apr 15 2016 ,Variation in reach-scale hydraulic conductivity of streambeds,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Streambed hydraulic conductivity is an important control on flow within the hyporheic zone, affecting hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes essential to river ecosystem function. Despite many published field measurements, few empirical studies examine the drivers of spatial and temporal variations in streambed hydraulic conductivity. Reach-averaged hydraulic conductivity estimated for 119 surveys in 83 stream reaches across continental France, even of coarse bed streams, are shown to be characteristic of sand and finer sediments. This supports a model where processes leading to the accumulation of finer sediments within streambeds largely control hydraulic conductivity rather than the size of the coarse bed sediment fraction. After describing a conceptual model of relevant processes, we fit an empirical model relating hydraulic conductivity to candidate geomorphic and hydraulic drivers. The fitted model explains 72% of the deviance in hydraulic conductivity (and 30% using an external cross-validation). Reach hydraulic conductivity increases with the amplitude of bedforms within the reach, the bankfull channel width-depth ratio, stream power and upstream catchment erodibility but reduces with time since the last streambed disturbance. The correlation between hydraulic conductivity and time since a streambed mobilisation event is likely a consequence of clogging processes. Streams with a predominantly suspended load and less frequent streambed disturbances are expected to have a lower streambed hydraulic conductivity and reduced hyporheic fluxes. This study suggests a close link between streambed sediment transport dynamics and connectivity between surface water and the hyporheic zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

37,37,"Vergnes, JP",Nov 2018 ,Impact of river water levels on the simulation of stream-aquifer exchanges over the Upper Rhine alluvial aquifer (France/Germany),HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,"This study aims to assess the sensitivity of river level estimations to the stream-aquifer exchanges within a hydrogeological model of the Upper Rhine alluvial aquifer (France/Germany), characterized as a large shallow aquifer with numerous hydropower dams. Two specific points are addressed: errors associated with digital elevation models (DEMs) and errors associated with the estimation of river level. The fine-resolution raw Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission dataset is used to assess the impact of the DEM uncertainties. Specific corrections are used to overcome these uncertainties: a simple moving average is applied to the topography along the rivers and additional data are used along the Rhine River to account for the numerous dams. Then, the impact of the river-level temporal variations is assessed through two different methods based on observed rating curves and on the Manning formula. Results are evaluated against observation data from 37 river-level points located over the aquifer, 190 piezometers, and a spatial database of wetlands. DEM uncertainties affect the spatial variability of the stream-aquifer exchanges by inducing strong noise and unrealistic peaks. The corrected DEM reduces the biases between observations and simulations by 22 and 51% for the river levels and the river discharges, respectively. It also improves the agreement between simulated groundwater overflows and observed wetlands. Introducing river-level time variability increases the stream-aquifer exchange range and reduces the piezometric head variability. These results confirm the need to better assess river levels in regional hydrogeological modeling, especially for applications in which stream-aquifer exchanges are important.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000448697800023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2Briver%2Bwater%2Blevels%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bsimulation%2Bof%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bexchanges%2Bover%2Bthe%2BUpper%2BRhine%2Balluvial%2Baquifer%2B%2528France%252FGermany%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DJean-Pierre%26rft.auinit%3DJP%26rft.aulast%3DVergnes%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10040-018-1788-0%26rft.eissn%3D1435-0157%26rft.epage%3D2457%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1431-2174%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROGEOLOGY%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2443-2457%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2443%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROGEOL%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D26%26rft.au%3DVergnes%252C%2BJP%26rft.au%3DHabets%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=HYDROGEOLOGY+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10040-018-1788-0,"Groundwater,surface-water relations,Numerical modeling,Transboundary aquifer,Wetlands,France,Germany","RADAR TOPOGRAPHY MISSION,LAND-SURFACE SCHEME,SHUTTLE RADAR,GROUNDWATER,MODELS,REPRESENTATION,DYNAMICS,RECHARGE,HEIGHT,FRANCE",,"BRGM French Geol Survey, Water Environm & Ecotechonol Div, 3 Ave C Guillemin,BP 36009, F-45060 Orleans 2, France"

Specifically, convolution representations used to model exchange of solute with the hyporheic zone are shown to be equivalent to solving one-dimensional subgrid models in Lagrangian form coupled to the advection dispersion equation for the stream channel. Unlike the convolution-based representations of previous travel time-based stream transport models, the subgrid model generalizes to include multicomponent reactive transport with general nonlinear reactions. An example involving biomass growth, the establishment of redox zonation, and the resulting impact on denitrification rates demonstrate reach-scale application of the new approach. Although simplified, those example simulations show some of the key phenomena associated with hyporheic zone denitrification that are not represented with conventional first-order estimates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000450726000007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMultiscale%2BFramework%2Bfor%2BModeling%2BMulticomponent%2BReactive%2BTransport%2Bin%2BStream%2BCorriders%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DSL%26rft.aulast%3DPainter%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR022831%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7230%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7216-7230%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7216%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR022831,,"RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE FLOWS,TRANSIENT STORAGE MODEL,NONSORBING SOLUTES,MOUNTAIN STREAM,RIVER,ZONE,DENITRIFICATION,BEDFORMS,NITROGEN",,"Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA"

We implemented these empirical relationships in a numerical network model and simulated stream water gains and losses and subsequent fractional hydrologic turnover across the stream network. We found that stream gains and losses from and to groundwater can influence source water contributions and stream water compositions across stream networks.

Unlike headwater stream reaches with continuous surface flow, the hydrology and ecology of subsurface stream reaches are poorly studied and not factored into existing wetland legislation. We assessed subsurface habitats and associated biota in a 435-m reach of a first-order, intermittent stream draining a riparian zone dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in north central Massachusetts. Stream flow was found only in subsurface flowpaths beneath large boulders and surface root mats over approximately 70% of the total stream length at summer base flow. Temperature, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations of subsurface water were similar to surface water. Macroinvertebrates were found in subsurface habitats but at a lower abundance and richness per unit area compared to surface habitats. Collectors such as Chironomidae, Polycentropodidae, and Ephemerellidae were generally the most abundant families in both surface and subsurface habitats. Our findings indicate that in some glaciated watersheds, intermittent streams with no visual evidence of surface flow may contain subsurface flowpaths with water chemistry and biota comparable to coupled perennial surface flow reaches. The prevalence and importance of subsurface habitats in some headwater streams may warrant review or revision of existing state and local regulatory definitions of intermittent and headwater streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000247423000011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSubsurface%2Bflowpaths%2Bin%2Ba%2Bforested%2Bheadwater%2Bstream%2Bharbor%2Ba%2Bdiverse%2Bmacroinvertebrate%2Bcommunity%26rft.aufirst%3DBridget%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DBM%26rft.aulast%3DCollins%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1672%252F0277-5212%25282007%252927%255B319%253ASFIAFH%255D2.0.CO%253B2%26rft.epage%3D325%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0277-5212%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWETLANDS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D319-325%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D319%26rft.stitle%3DWETLANDS%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DCollins%252C%2BBM%26rft.au%3DSobczak%252C%2BWV%26rft.au%3DColburn%252C%2BEA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WETLANDS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[319:SFIAFH]2.0.CO;2,"hyporheic zone,intermittent streams,stream macroinvertebrates,wetland delineation","HEMLOCK TSUGA-CANADENSIS,HYPORHEIC INVERTEBRATES,EASTERN HEMLOCK,FLOW PATHS,ASSEMBLAGES,DISTURBANCE,CATCHMENT,HABITAT,WATER,RESPONSES",,"Coll Holy Cross, Dept Biol, 1 Coll St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA"
41,41,"Riedel, JW",Sep 2022 ,Investigating Thermal Controls on the Hyporheic Flux as Evaluated Using Numerical Modeling of Flume-Derived Data,HYDROLOGY,"The flux of water through the hyporheic zone (HZ) is controlled by stream bedforms, sinuosity, surface water velocity, local water table, seasonality, and hydraulic conductivity (K) of the bed material. Dependent on both the kinematic viscosity and density of water, K values are a function of temperature. In most studies, changes in temperature have been neglected because of the limited effect either density or viscosity has on K values. However, these variations are important given the role of K in HZ flux, which lead to the hypothesis that flow into the HZ would be more efficient (faster rate and greater depth) under warmer conditions than under cool conditions. To discern how water temperature affects flow depth in the HZ, VS2DHI simulations were created to map flow under both warm and cool thermal conditions. The models employed data collected from a series of varying temperature hydrologic flume tests in which the effects of hyporheic flow altering variables such as sinuosity, surface water velocity and volume, and bed-forms were controlled.

During the selection of different modelling methods, optimization techniques and management scenarios, several pareto fronts can be generated. In the present work, an attempt has been made by performing intensive comparisons between different pareto fronts to compare the efficiency and convergence of different S-O models. In this process, groundwater models were developed to simulate the River-Aquifer (R-A) exchanges for the study area as groundwater pumping influences the rate of R-A exchanges and alters the flow dynamics. The developed models were coupled with optimization models and were executed to solve the multi-objective optimization problems based on the maximization of discharge through pumping wells and maximization of groundwater input into the river through R-A exchanges. The distinctive features of the paper include a pareto front comparison where fronts developed by different S-O models were compared and analysed based on various parameters. The results show the dominance of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) over other optimization algorithms and concluded that the maximization of pumping rate significantly changes after considering the R-A exchanges-based objective functions. This study concludes that the model domain also alters the output of simulation-optimization. Therefore, model domain and corresponding boundary conditions should be selected carefully for the field application of management models. The artificial neural network (ANN) models have been also developed to deal with the computationally expensive simulation models by reducing the processing time and found efficient.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000783442400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOptimization%2Bof%2BGroundwater%2BPumping%2Band%2BRiver-Aquifer%2BExchanges%2Bfor%2BManagement%2Bof%2BWater%2BResources%26rft.aufirst%3DMayank%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DBajpai%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-022-03112-5%26rft.eissn%3D1573-1650%26rft.epage%3D1878%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1863-1878%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1863%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DBajpai%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DMishra%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DGraillot%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11269-022-03112-5,"Simulation-optimization,Multi-objective optimization,Artificial neural network,River-Aquifer exchanges","SURFACE-WATER,STREAM TEMPERATURES,UNCERTAINTY,FLOW,ACCURACY",,"Indian Inst Technol BHU, Dept Civil Engn, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India"
43,43,"Clow, DW",Sep 2021 ,Spatiotemporal Dynamics of CO2 Gas Exchange From Headwater Mountain Streams,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Mountain streams play an important role in the global carbon cycle by transporting, metabolizing, and exchanging carbon they receive from the terrestrial environment. The rates at which these processes occur remain highly uncertain because of a paucity of observations and the difficulty of measuring gas exchange rates in steep, turbulent mountain streams. This uncertainty is compounded by large temporal and spatial variability in stream carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in mountain environments. In this study, we measured diel, seasonal, and annual variations in CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) in seven headwater streams and a groundwater spring in the Colorado Rocky Mountains to determine how CO2 exchange fluxes (FCO2) vary with time, annual precipitation, and landscape characteristics. Our results show that temporal variability in pCO(2) and FCO2 in mountain streams is large and is strongly influenced by solar radiation, the accumulation and melting of seasonal snowpacks, and interannual variations in precipitation. Spatial variations in pCO(2) and FCO2 were related to landscape characteristics, with soil organic matter, wetlands, and likely groundwater discharge zones having a positive influence. Periglacial features, such as ice and rock glaciers, had a negative influence on stream pCO(2) and FCO2. Estimated FCO2 from streams in an alpine/subalpine region of Colorado was 3.4 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) normalized to stream surface area (95% CI: 2.1-5.0 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)), consistent with recent work on CO2 exchange from mountain streams in the Swiss Alps. Our results highlight the importance of mountain streams as substantial contributors in the global carbon cycle.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000703067000033,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021JG006509%26rft.atitle%3DSpatiotemporal%2BDynamics%2Bof%2BCO2%2BGas%2BExchange%2BFrom%2BHeadwater%2BMountain%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DD.%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DDW%26rft.aulast%3DClow%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021JG006509%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D126%26rft.au%3DClow%252C%2BDW%26rft.au%3DStriegl%252C%2BRG%26rft.au%3DDornblaser%252C%2BMM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2021JG006509,"carbon,CO2,evasion,exchange,fluxes","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,CATCHMENT,DIOXIDE,EVASION,COLORADO,EMISSIONS,PCO(2),EXPORT,DEPOSITION",,"US Geol Survey, Denver Fed Ctr, Box 25046, Denver, CO 80225 USA"
44,44,"Marion, A",Oct 14 2008 ,Solute transport in rivers with multiple storage zones: The STIR model,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Solute transport in rivers is controlled by surface hydrodynamics and by mass exchanges between the surface stream and distinct retention zones. This paper presents a residence time model for stream transport of solutes, Solute Transport in Rivers (STIR), that accounts for the effect of the stream-subsurface interactions on river mixing. A stochastic approach is used to derive a relation between the in-stream solute concentration and the residence time distributions (RTDs) in different retention domains. Particular forms of the RTD are suggested for the temporary storage within surface dead zones and for bed form-induced hyporheic exchange. This approach is advantageous for at least two reasons. The first advantage is that exchange parameters can generally be expressed as functions of physical quantities that can be reasonably estimated or directly measured. This gives the model predictive capabilities, and the results can be generalized to conditions different from those directly observed in field experiments. The second reason is that individual exchange processes are represented separately by appropriate residence time distributions, making the model flexible and modular, capable of incorporating the effects of a variety of exchange processes and chemical reactions in a detailed way. The capability of the model is illustrated with an example and with an application to a field case. Analogies and differences with other established models are also discussed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000260181800002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW10406%26rft.atitle%3DSolute%2Btransport%2Bin%2Brivers%2Bwith%2Bmultiple%2Bstorage%2Bzones%253A%2BThe%2BSTIR%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarion%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007037%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DMarion%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DZaramella%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DBottacin-Busolin%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2008WR007037,,"ADVECTION-DISPERSION EQUATION,RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION,SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,HYPORHEIC-EXCHANGE,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,MOUNTAIN STREAM,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,FRACTIONAL DIFFUSION,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT",,"Univ Padua, Dept Hydraul Maritime Environm & Geotech Engn, Via Loredan 20, I-35131 Padua, Italy"
45,45,"Wade, J",Dec 2020 ,Beaver dam analogues drive heterogeneous groundwater-surface water interactions,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Beaver dam analogues (BDAs) are a cost-effective stream restoration approach that leverages the recognized environmental benefits of natural beaver dams on channel stability and local hydrology. Although natural beaver dams are known to exert considerable influence on the hydrologic conditions of a stream system by mediating geomorphic processes, nutrient cycling, and groundwater-surface water interactions, the impacts of beaver-derived restoration methods on groundwater-surface water exchange are poorly characterized. To address this deficit, we monitored hyporheic exchange fluxes and streambed porewater biogeochemistry across a sequence of BDAs installed along a central Wyoming stream during the summer of 2019. Streambed fluxes were quantified by heat tracing methods and vertical hydraulic gradients. Biogeochemical activity was evaluated using major ion porewater chemistry and principal component analysis. Vertical fluxes of approximately 1.0 m/day were observed around the BDAs, as was the development of spatially heterogeneous zones of nitrate production, groundwater upwelling, and anaerobic reduction. Strong contrasts in hyporheic zone processes were observed across BDAs of differing sizes. This suggests that structures may function with size-dependent behaviour, only altering groundwater-surface water interactions after a threshold hydraulic step height is exceeded. Patterns of hyporheic exchange and biogeochemical cycling around the studied BDAs resemble those around natural beaver dams, suggesting that BDAs may provide comparable benefits to channel complexity and near-stream function over a 1-year period.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000582622900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBeaver%2Bdam%2Banalogues%2Bdrive%2Bheterogeneous%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Binteractions%26rft.aufirst%3DJeffrey%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DWade%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13947%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D5353%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D26%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5340-5353%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5340%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DWade%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DLautz%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DPearce%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.13947,"beaver dam,groundwater–,surface water interactions,heat tracing,hyporheic zone,redox,stream restoration","HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE FLOWS,STREAM WATER,FLUX,ZONE,DIFFUSIVITY,PATTERNS,ECOLOGY,IMPACT,RIVERS,HEAT",,"Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA"

The scale of drainage areas contributing to the stream reaches studied in the Willamette Basin ranges from 10 to 12,000 km(2). A transient storage assessment of the tracer studies has been completed using the U.S. Geological Survey's One-dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage (OTIS) model, which incorporates storage exchange and decay functions along with the traditional dispersion and advection transport equation. The analysis estimates solute transport of the dye. It identifies first-order decay coefficients to be on the order of 10(-5)/sed for the nonconservative Rhodamine WT. On an individual subreach basis, the first-order decay is slower (typically by an order of magnitude) than the transient storage process, indicating that nonconservative tracers may be used to evaluate transient storage in rivers. In the transient storage analysis, a dimensionless parameter (A(S)/A) expresses the spatial extent of storage zone area relative to stream cross section. In certain reaches of Willamette Basin pool-and-riffle, gravel-bed rivers, this parameter was as large as 0.5. A measure of the storage exchange flux was calculated for each stream subreach in the simulation analysis. This storage exchange is shown subjectively to be higher at higher stream discharges. Hyporheic linkage between streams and subsurface flows is the probable physical mechanism contributing to a significant part of this inferred active transient storage. Hyporheic linkages are further suggested by detailed measurements of river discharge with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler system delineating zones in two large rivers where water alternately enters and leaves the surface channels through gravel-and-cobble riverbeds. Measurements show patterns of hyporheic exchange that are highly variable in time and space.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000171459900010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTransient%2Bstorage%2Bassessments%2Bof%2Bdye-tracer%2Binjections%2Bin%2Brivers%2Bof%2Bthe%2BWillamette%2BBasin%252C%2BOregon%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DLaenen%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1752-1688.2001.tb00975.x%26rft.epage%3D377%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D367-377%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D367%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D37%26rft.au%3DLaenen%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBencala%252C%2BKE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2001.tb00975.x,,"SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,RHODAMINE-WT DYE,MOUNTAIN STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,CHANNEL,NITRATE,MODEL",,"US Geol Survey, 120 NE Billingher Dr, Portland, OR 97220 USA"
47,47,"Roche, KR",May 2018 ,Turbulence Links Momentum and Solute Exchange in Coarse-Grained Streambeds,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of solutes between surface and pore waters is an important control over stream ecology and biogeochemistry. Free-stream turbulence is known to enhance transport across the sediment-water interface (SWI), but the link between turbulent momentum and solute transport within the hyporheic zone remains undetermined due to a lack of in situ observations. Here, we relate turbulent momentum and solute transport using measurements within a streambed with 0.04 m diameter sediment. Pore water velocities were measured using endoscopic particle image velocimetry and used to generate depth profiles of turbulence statistics. Solute transport was observed directly within the hyporheic zone using an array of microsensors. Solute injection experiments were used to assess turbulent fluxes across the SWI and patterns of hyporheic mixing. Depth profiles of fluctuations in solute concentration were compared with profiles of turbulence statistics, and profiles of mean solute concentration were compared to an effective dispersion model. Fluorescent visualization experiments at a Reynolds number of Re >= 27,000 revealed the presence of large-scale motions that ejected tracer from the pore waters, and that these events were not present at Re = 13,000. Turbulent shear stresses and high-frequency concentration fluctuations decayed greatly within 1-2 grain diameters below the SWI. However, low-frequency concentration fluctuations penetrated to greater depths than high-frequency fluctuations. Comparison with a constant-coefficient dispersion model showed that hyporheic mixing was enhanced in regions where turbulent stresses were observed. Together, these results show that the penetration of turbulence into the bed directly controls both interfacial exchange and mixing within a transition layer below the SWI.Plain Language Summary Streams and rivers continuously exchange water with their underlying sediments in a region called the hyporheic zone. This zone is a hotspot of transformation for many societally relevant chemicals, including carbon, nutrients, and contaminants. Accurate predictions for how much transformation occurs in the hyporheic zone requires an improved understanding of how reactive chemicals are transported into, and within, this region of a riverbed. Although fluid turbulence can be the dominant process controlling surface-subsurface exchange in gravel-bed streams, its influence is poorly understood due to the difficulty of measuring turbulent fluid velocities and concentrations within the streambed. In this experimental study, we show that turbulence strongly couples surface waters with hyporheic waters in a thin layer where the water column and stream sediments meet. As a result, fluid transport and mixing are enhanced several centimeters into the hyporheic zone of gravel-bed streams. These findings support recent theoretical arguments that surface and subsurface waters are not independent and must instead be treated as a single unit to accurately model solute, particulate and pollutant transport in streams and rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000442351300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTurbulence%2BLinks%2BMomentum%2Band%2BSolute%2BExchange%2Bin%2BCoarse-Grained%2BStreambeds%26rft.aufirst%3DK.%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DKR%26rft.aulast%3DRoche%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2017WR021992%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D3242%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3225-3242%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3225%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DRoche%252C%2BKR%26rft.au%3DBlois%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2017WR021992,,"HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,BED FORMS,SEDIMENT TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSIENT STORAGE,CHANNEL FLOW,PERMEABILITY,SURFACE,MODEL,WATER",,"Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA"
48,48,"Kim, H",Apr 16 2014 ,Numerical verification of hyporheic zone depth estimation using streambed temperature,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hyporheic zone is the active region of groundwater and surface water mixing, and consequently, through which the contaminants released to surface water are transferred to groundwater. Because of the high energy demand and expense associated with the remediation of contaminated groundwater, it has become a matter of primary concern to find an efficient and cost-effective way to restore the contaminated groundwater. Therefore delineating the hyporheic zone is of vital importance for the prevention and management of groundwater contamination. This paper proposes a method to estimate the depth of the hyporheic zone using heat transfer analysis for a streambed. In order to assess the adequacy of the proposed method, the sensitivity of the results of heat transfer analyses to the hyporheic flux was evaluated. Due to the high sensitivity to the hyporheic zone depth, the heat transfer analysis was determined to be appropriate to delineate the hyporheic zone depth. The depth estimated from the heat transfer analysis was comparable with that from a conventional tracer test. The proposed method has an advantage over existing methods of determining the hyporheic zone depth due to the fact that it only requires field temperature measurements.

49,49,"Liu, BJ",Dec 2020 ,Improved dynamic simulation technique for hydrodynamics and water quality of river-connected lakes,WATER SUPPLY,"In this study, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic water-quality model is proposed for river-connected lakes in an effort to improve calibration accuracy and reduce computational burden. To achieve this, the sensitivity of parameters involved in the hydrodynamic model is analyzed using stepwise rank regression and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), and the roughness coefficient, wind drag coefficient and wind resistance coefficient are identified as the most important parameters affecting the hydrodynamics of the Hongze Lake. Then, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used to assimilate observations to the proposed hydrodynamic and water quality model. It is found that assimilation of both state variables and model parameters results in a significant improvement of the simulation of the water level, flow velocity and pollutant concentration in the Hongze Lake.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000617140800068,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImproved%2Bdynamic%2Bsimulation%2Btechnique%2Bfor%2Bhydrodynamics%2Band%2Bwater%2Bquality%2Bof%2Briver-connected%2Blakes%26rft.aufirst%3DBojun%26rft.auinit%3DBJ%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2166%252Fws.2020.125%26rft.eissn%3D1607-0798%26rft.epage%3D3767%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1606-9749%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BSUPPLY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3752-3767%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3752%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BSUPPLY%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BBJ%26rft.au%3DXia%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BTS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4D64MNiGDjkSiHuyRMDRH&SrcJTitle=WATER+SUPPLY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2166/ws.2020.125,"dynamic simulation,hydrodynamics,model assimilation,river-connected lake,water quality",MODEL,,"Yellow River Engn Consulting Co Ltd, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, Peoples R China"
