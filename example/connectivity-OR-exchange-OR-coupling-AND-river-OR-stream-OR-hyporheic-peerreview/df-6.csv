0,"Dole-Olivier, MJ",2011 ,The hyporheic refuge hypothesis reconsidered: a review of hydrological aspects,MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is thought to serve multiple functions for lotic invertebrates, but its role in the persistence of benthic assemblages after disturbances ('hyporheic refuge hypothesis', HRH) has never been clearly demonstrated since its initial proposal in 1953. Water exchanges through the HZ appear to be crucial in determining most hyporheic processes and subsequently, in controlling directly or indirectly the distribution of hyporheic assemblages. At present, it seems that the distribution of hyporheic refugia would also be controlled by hyporheic flowpaths, explaining the non-uniform response to the HRH documented in the literature. In light of recent developments in hyporheic hydrology, it is timely to propose research directions for understanding the distribution and patchiness of hyporheic refugia. This review proposes a framework of hypotheses, based on the recognition of hyporheic flowpaths across several scales and predicting the highest refugial capacity in large-scale upwelling zones. Outcomes from this framework include the development of physical indicators measuring the ability of the HZ to protect invertebrates, the identification of river areas demonstrating the highest refuge capacity (hyporheic hotspots) and the promotion in restoration projects of suitable hydrologic exchanges for enhancing the development of hyporheic hotspots.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000296440400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bhyporheic%2Brefuge%2Bhypothesis%2Breconsidered%253A%2Ba%2Breview%2Bof%2Bhydrological%2Baspects%26rft.aufirst%3DMarie-Jose%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DDole-Olivier%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1071%252FMF11084%26rft.eissn%3D1448-6059%26rft.epage%3D1302%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1323-1650%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1281-1302%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1281%26rft.stitle%3DMAR%2BFRESHWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D62&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Tonina, D",Oct 2016 ,Does streambed heterogeneity matter for hyporheic residence time distribution in sand-bedded streams?,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Stream water residence times within streambed sediments are key values to quantify hyporheic processes including sediment thermal regime, solute transient storage, dilution rates and biogeochemical transformations, such as those controlling degassing nitrous oxide. Heterogeneity of the streambed sediment hydraulic properties has been shown to be potentially an important factor to characterize hyporheic processes. Here, we quantify the importance of streambed heterogeneity on residence times of dune-like bedform induced hyporheic fluxes at the bedform and reach scales. We show that heterogeneity has a net effect of compression of the hyporheic zone (HZ) toward the streambed, changing HZ volume from the homogenous case and thus inducing remarkable differences in the flow field with respect to the homogeneous case. We unravel the physical conditions for which the commonly used homogenous field assumption is applicable for quantifying hyporheic processes thus explaining why predictive measures based on a characteristic residence time, like the Damkohler number, are robust in heterogeneous sand bedded streams.

We determined ecosystem respiration hyporheic community respiration, and respiration of the epilithic community at the sediment surface in the Necker, a gravel-bed river, during August 1994. Ecosystem respiration, assessed using single-station diel oxygen curves, varied between 4.6 and 7.0 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1). To estimate the respiration of the epilithic community, stones were collected from the surface layer and enclosed in flow-through respiration chambers. The respiration of the epilithic community (mainly algae) ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1), contributing 4-19% of the river ecosystem respiration. Two different methods were used for measuring hyporheic community respiration First, chambers were incubated at 30 cm sediment depth for direct assessment of respiration rates. Respiration rates of the hyporheic sediment were measured using a closed chamber system and extrapolated for comparison over 0.5 m and 1 m sediment depth. Second, the difference between whole-ecosystem respiration and respiration of the epilithic community was used for calculating the hyporheic contribution. Hyporheic respiration rates ranged from 3.9 to 5.9 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1), contributing 76-96% of ecosystem respiration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000071795200006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DContribution%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bto%2Becosystem%2Bmetabolism%2Bin%2Ba%2Bprealpine%2Bgravel-bed%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DMW%26rft.auinit%3DMW%26rft.aulast%3DNaegeli%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468172%26rft.epage%3D804%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D794-804%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D794%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D16%26rft.au%3DNaegeli%252C%2BMW%26rft.au%3DUehlinger%252C%2BU&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
3,"Lee, A",Mar 2021 ,Hyporheic Exchange in Sand Dunes Under a Freely Deforming River Water Surface,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Bedform-driven hyporheic exchange is conditioned by the head gradients at the sediment water interface. Local exchange phenomena between the surface and the subsurface are often driven by the dynamic forces related to the velocity distributions around sediment waves. In open channels, the static forces are represented by the water depth, yet most computational fluid dynamics models use a rigid-lid approximation. We investigated whether and when the deformation of the river's free-surface influences bedform-driven hyporheic exchange. This was done through simulations of coupled open channel and hyporheic flows with the air-water interface modeled either as a free-surface or a rigid-lid across increasing subcritical Froude numbers from similar to 0.05 to similar to 0.95. The normalized hyporheic flux was higher when considering free-surface deformation across most of the range of Froude numbers considered. When the Froude number was larger than 0.6 and smaller than 0.85, both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic-driven fluxes increased significantly compared to the rigid-lid approach and the total flux was about five times that predicted with the rigid-lid. These results indicate that bedform-driven hyporheic fluxes are underestimated in most studies that use a rigid-lid assumption in subcritical flows.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000635680800027,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028817%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bin%2BSand%2BDunes%2BUnder%2Ba%2BFreely%2BDeforming%2BRiver%2BWater%2BSurface%26rft.aufirst%3DAnzy%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DLee%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028817%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DAubeneau%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Packman, AI",Apr 18 2003 ,"Interplay of stream-subsurface exchange, clay particle deposition, and streambed evolution",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] Hyporheic exchange ( mixing of stream water with pore water beneath the stream) is responsible for the transport of many ecologically relevant substances across the stream-subsurface interface. This process is dependent on both the streamflow conditions and sedimentary properties, but the complex nature of fluvial systems has presented a barrier to the development of mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of stream-subsurface interactions. This work presents the results of a controlled study to examine in detail the relationship between stream-subsurface exchange fluxes, delivery of suspended sediments to the hyporheic region, fine particle accumulation in the streambed, and alteration of sedimentary properties. Laboratory flume experiments were used to observe kaolinite clay deposition in a sand bed and the resulting alteration of hyporheic exchange fluxes. Solute and suspended sediment exchange with clean sand beds is predicted well by a fundamental model for bed form-driven advective pumping exchange. However, substantial accumulation of clay in the bed causes an alteration of the pore water flow environment, which reduces both water flux across the stream-subsurface interface and subsequent particle deposition. Measurement of bulk solute exchange and direct observation of clay accumulation in the bed both indicate that transported fine particles are preferentially removed near the stream-subsurface interface. Clogging of inflow regions produces heterogeneous subsurface clay deposits even when the bed is initially homogeneous. This behavior is also predicted by the fundamental colloid pumping model. These results contradict the accepted view that suspended sediments will generally deposit in the deepest regions of the bed and thus clog the bed from the bottom upward. Our results indicate that clogging of the streambed surface will often isolate deeper regions of the bed from the streamflow, so that even relatively low amounts of suspended sediments can substantially degrade streambed habitat.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000182596500002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1097%26rft.atitle%3DInterplay%2Bof%2Bstream-subsurface%2Bexchange%252C%2Bclay%2Bparticle%2Bdeposition%252C%2Band%2Bstreambed%2Bevolution%26rft.aufirst%3DAI%26rft.auinit%3DAI%26rft.aulast%3DPackman%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2002WR001432%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DMacKay%252C%2BJS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"Datry, T",Aug 2007 ,Responses of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages to large-scale variation in flow permanence and surface-subsurface exchange,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Flow permanence (the proportion of time that flowing water is present) strongly influences benthic invertebrate assemblages in ephemeral and intermittent river reaches. Effects of varying flow permanence on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages are not well understood, and have not previously been studied at large spatial scales.2. We used a 52-km long flow-permanence gradient in the alluvial Selwyn River, New Zealand to assess hyporheic assemblage responses to variation in flow permanence and surface-subsurface exchange. The Selwyn mainstem consists of perennial and temporary reaches embedded in longer downwelling (losing) and upwelling (gaining) sections.3. We predicted that hyporheic invertebrate diversity, density and assemblage stability would increase with increasing flow permanence. We further predicted that assemblage structure would be influenced by the relative contribution of downwelling and upwelling water at the reach-scale.4. Hyporheic invertebrates were collected at 15 river cross-sections over a 13-month period. As predicted, hyporheic taxon richness, density and assemblage stability varied directly with flow permanence. The distribution of taxa along the flow permanence gradient appeared to be related to desiccation resistance. However, it is possible that proximity to colonist sources also contributed to distribution patterns.5. Taxon richness was significantly higher at sites in the gaining section compared with the losing section. Sites with high flow permanence in the gaining and losing sections supported distinct hyporheic assemblages, characterised by amphipods and isopods in the gaining section, and ostracods, Hydra sp. and the mayfly Deleatidium spp. in the losing section.6. Results of the study suggest an expansion of the scope of the Hyporheic Corridor Concept to include large hyporheic flowpaths associated with unbounded alluvial plains rivers. Hyporheic assemblages in alluvial rivers are strongly influenced by large-scale flow permanence gradients, large-scale surface water-groundwater exchange, and their interactions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000247905900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DResponses%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Binvertebrate%2Bassemblages%2Bto%2Blarge-scale%2Bvariation%2Bin%2Bflow%2Bpermanence%2Band%2Bsurface-subsurface%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DThibault%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DDatry%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2007.01775.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1462%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1452-1462%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1452%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DLarned%252C%2BST%26rft.au%3DScarsbrook%252C%2BMR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
6,"Vervier, P",Jun 15 2009 ,"Influence of the hyporheic zone on the phosphorus dynamics of a large gravel-bed river, Garonne River, France",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Phosphorus (P) concentrations in sediments and in surface and interstitial water from three gravel bars in a large river (Garonne River, southern France) were measured daily, downstream of a wastewater treatment plant for a city of 740000 inhabitants (Toulouse). Measurements were made of vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG), total dissolved phosphor-us (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) in water and of three extractable forms of phosphorus (water extractable, NaOH extractable and H2SO4 extractable) in hyporheic sediments from the gravel bars. Dissolved phosphorus was the major contributor to TP (74-79%) in both interstitial and surface waters on all sampling dates, and in most cases surface water P concentrations were significantly higher than interstitial concentrations. Hyporheic sediment TP concentrations ranged between 269 and 465 mu g g(-1) and were highest in fine sediment fractions. Acid-extractable P, a non-bioavailable form, represented at least 95% of sediment TP. A positive relationship was observed between VHG and TP in two of the gravel bars, with wells that were strongly downwelling having lower TP concentrations. These results suggest that in downwelling zones, hyporheic sediments can trap surface-derived dissolved P, and that much of this P becomes stored in refractory particulate forms. Bioavailable P is mainly present in dissolved form and only occupies a small fraction of total P, with particulate P comprising the majority of total P.

7,"Takahashi, G",May 15 2008 ,Hyporheic flow as a potential geomorphic agent in the evolution of channel morphology in a gravel-bed river,CATENA,"Morphologic and hydrologic properties of head-cut gullies formed in meandering bends of a gravel-bed river in northern Japan were examined to investigate their topographic development. head-cut gullies had incised to 2 in below the floodplain surface and had perennial seepage outflows. Because no surface runoff was observed across the meandering necks, we hypothesized that hyporheic flow erosion cutting into the down-river edge of the meandering necks is one factor for the development of head-cut gullies. Several topographic features caused by sapping and piping erosion were observed within the head-cut gullies. A tracer experiment and examination of the water table, water chemistry, and water table responses in wells on the floodplain and within the head-cut gully revealed that significant preferential hyporheic flow occurred between coarse cobble and fine sediment layers of the floodplain materials. During a storm event, water tables around the head-cut gully quickly responded to changes in the water table of the stream channel; this result also suggests that hyporheic flow occurred across the meandering bends. Hyporheic flow around the head-cut gullies had higher hydraulic conductivities and preferential flow paths that may relate to buried beds of paleochannels. An erosion model suggests that it is unlikely that hyporheic flow alone had enough energy to account for all the soil erosion. Thus, a combination of hyporheic flow (sapping erosion) and channel erosion (bank erosion) appeared to contribute to the formation of the head-cut gullies. Hyporheic flow is an important component in the geomorphic evolution of channels and the floodplain in a gravel-bed river. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Particulate organic matter (POM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity and temperature were sampled from wells in a riparian terrace on the Queets River, Washington, U.S.A. on 25 March, 15 May, 20 July and 09 October 1999. Dissolved nitrate, ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus were also collected on 20 July and 09 October 1999. Wells were characterised by their associated overlying vegetation: bare cobble/young alder, mid-aged alder (8-20 years) and old alder/old-growth conifer (25 to > 100 years). POM was analysed for the ash-free dry mass and the activities of eight exoenzymes (alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, beta -N-acetylglucosaminidase, xylosidase, phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, esterase and endopeptidase) using fluorogenic substrates.3. Exoenzyme activities in the Queets River hyporheic zone indicated the presence of an active microbial community metabolising a diverse array of organic molecules. Individual exoenzyme activity (mean +/- standard error) ranged from 0.507 +/- 0.1547 to 22.8 +/- 5.69 mu mol MUF (g AFDM)-1 h-1, was highly variable among wells and varied seasonally, with the lowest rates occurring in March. Exoenzyme activities were weakly correlated with DO, DOC and inorganic nutrient concentrations.4. Ratios of leucine aminopeptidase : beta-glucosidase were low in March, May and October and high in July, potentially indicating a switch from polysaccharides to proteins as the dominant component of microbial metabolism.5. Principal components analysis indicated that there were patch effects and that these effects were strongest in the summer.6. DOM degradation patterns did not change systematically along hyporheic flowpaths but varied with overlying forest patch type in the Queets River hyporheic zone, suggesting that additional carbon inputs exist. We hypothesise that the most likely input is the downward movement of DOM from overlying riparian soils. Understanding this movement of DOM from soils to subsurface water is essential for understanding both the hyporheic metabolism and the carbon budget of streams and rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000279734300002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExoenzyme%2Bactivities%2Bas%2Bindicators%2Bof%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bmatter%2Bcomposition%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bfloodplain%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DSandra%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DClinton%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2009.02383.x%26rft.epage%3D1615%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1603-1615%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1603%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DClinton%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DEdwards%252C%2BRT%26rft.au%3DFindlay%252C%2BSEG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
9,"VALETT, HM",Mar 1994 ,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE AND ECOLOGICAL STABILITY OF A DESERT STREAM ECOSYSTEM,ECOLOGY,The influence of hydrologic linkage between hyporheic and surface subsystems was investigated in sand-bottomed reaches of a desert stream. Direction of hydrologic exchange was measured as vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) using mini-piezometers. Maps of VHG indicated upwelling (discharge from the interstitial regions into surface water) at the bases of riffles and heads of runs; downwelling (infiltration of surface water into the hyporheic zone) occurred at the bases of runs. Dissolved NO3-N in surface water was higher over or immediately downstream from upwelling zones. Loss of continued supply from the hyporheic zone and intense assimilatory demand by surface autotrophs generated longitudinal declines in NO3-N and lower nutrient concentrations in downwelling zones. Algal standing crop (as chlorophyll a) was significantly higher in upwelling zones than in areas without positive VHG. Postflood trajectories of chlorophyll a indicated that algae at upwelling zones recovered from disturbance significantly faster than those at downwelling zones. Recovery rate was related to supply of NO3-N from enriched interstitial water in the hyporheic zone. Hydrologic linkage integrates surface and hyporheic subsystems and increases ecosystem stability by enhancing resilience of primary producers following flash flood disturbance.Show less,https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1994MZ45400025,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVERTICAL%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BEXCHANGE%2BAND%2BECOLOGICAL%2BSTABILITY%2BOF%2BA%2BDESERT%2BSTREAM%2BECOSYSTEM%26rft.aufirst%3DHM%26rft.auinit%3DHM%26rft.aulast%3DVALETT%26rft.date%3D1994%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1939557%26rft.epage%3D560%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-9658%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D548-560%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D548%26rft.stitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D75%26rft.au%3DVALETT%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DFISHER%252C%2BSG%26rft.au%3DCAMILL%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Cuthbert, MO",Nov 2010 ,Impacts of river bed gas on the hydraulic and thermal dynamics of the hyporheic zone,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Despite the presence of gas in river beds being a well known phenomenon, its potential feedbacks on the hydraulic and thermal dynamics of the hyporheic zone has not been widely studied. This paper explores hypotheses that the presence of accumulated gas impacts the hydraulic and thermal dynamics of a river bed due to changes in specific storage, hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, and thermal diffusivity. The hypotheses are tested using data analysis and modelling for a study site on the urban River Tame, Birmingham, UK. Gas, predominantly attributed to microbial denitrification, was observed in the river bed up to around 14% by volume, and to at least 0.8 m depth below river bed. Numerical modelling indicates that, by altering the relative hydraulic conductivity distribution, the gas in the river bed leads to an increase of groundwater discharge from the river banks (relative to river bed) by a factor of approximately 2 during river low flow periods. The increased compressible storage of the gas phase in the river bed leads to an increase in the simulated volume of river water invading the river bed within the centre of the channel during storm events. The exchange volume can be more than 30% greater in comparison to that for water saturated conditions. Furthermore, the presence of gas also reduces the water-filled porosity, and so the possible depth of such invading flows may also increase markedly, by more than a factor of 2 in the observed case. Observed diurnal temperature variations within the gaseous river bed at 0.1 and 0.5 m depth are, respectively, around 1.5 and 6 times larger than those predicted for saturated sediments. Annual temperature fluctuations are seen to be enhanced by around 4 to 20% compared to literature values for saturated sediments. The presence of gas may thus alter the bulk thermal properties to such a degree that the use of heat tracer techniques becomes subject to a much greater degree of uncertainty. Although the likely magnitude of thermal and hydraulic changes due to the presence of gas for this site have been demonstrated, further research is needed into the origins of the gas and its spatial and temporal variability to enable quantification of the significance of these changes for chemical attenuation and hyporheic zone biology.

11,"Lu, CP",Jul 2018 ,The Influences of a Clay Lens on the Hyporheic Exchange in a Sand Dune,WATER,"A laboratory flume simulating a riverbed sand dune containing a low-permeability clay lens was constructed to investigate its influence on the quality and quantity of hyporheic exchange. By varying the depths and spatial locations of the clay lens, 24 scenarios and one blank control experiment were created. Dye tracers were applied to visualize patterns of hyporheic exchange and the extent of the hyporheic zone, while NaCl tracers were used to calculate hyporheic fluxes. The results revealed that the clay lens reduces hyporheic exchange and that the reduction depends on its spatial location. In general, the effect was stronger when the lens was in the center of the sand dune. The effect weakened when the lens was moved near the boundary of the sand dune. A change in horizontal location had a stronger influence on the extent of the hyporheic zone compared with a change in depth. The size of the hyporheic zone changed with the depth and position of the clay lens. There was a maximum of hyporheic extent with the lens at a depth of 0.1 m caused by changes of water flow paths.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000442579700009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B826%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BInfluences%2Bof%2Ba%2BClay%2BLens%2Bon%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2Bin%2Ba%2BSand%2BDune%26rft.aufirst%3DChengpeng%26rft.auinit%3DCP%26rft.aulast%3DLu%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw10070826%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BCP%26rft.au%3DYao%252C%2BCC%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BMM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
12,"Gomez-Velez, JD",Oct 2017 ,Flow and Residence Times of Dynamic River Bank Storage and Sinuosity-Driven Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) vary significantly along river corridors due to spatiotemporal changes in discharge and geomorphology. This variability results in the emergence of biogeochemical hot-spots and hot-moments that ultimately control solute and energy transport and ecosystem services from the local to the watershed scales. In this work, we use a reduced-order model to gain mechanistic understanding of river bank storage and sinuosity-driven hyporheic exchange induced by transient river discharge. This is the first time that a systematic analysis of both processes is presented and serves as an initial step to propose parsimonious, physics-based models for better predictions of water quality at the large watershed scale. The effects of channel sinuosity, alluvial valley slope, hydraulic conductivity, and river stage forcing intensity and duration are encapsulated in dimensionless variables that can be easily estimated or constrained. We find that the importance of perturbations in the hyporheic zone's flux, residence times, and geometry is mainly explained by two-dimensionless variables representing the ratio of the hydraulic time constant of the aquifer and the duration of the event (Gamma(d)) and the importance of the ambient groundwater flow (Delta h*). Our model additionally shows that even systems with small sensitivity, resulting in small changes in the hyporheic zone extent, are characterized by highly variable exchange fluxes and residence times. These findings highlight the importance of including dynamic changes in hyporheic zones for typical HEF models such as the transient storage model.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000418736000026,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFlow%2Band%2BResidence%2BTimes%2Bof%2BDynamic%2BRiver%2BBank%2BStorage%2Band%2BSinuosity-Driven%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DGomez-Velez%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2017WR021362%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D8595%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D8572-8595%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D8572%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DWilson%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"Hartwig, M",Mar 2012 ,Suspended sediments in the Kharaa River catchment (Mongolia) and its impact on hyporheic zone functions,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"A previous study investigating the ecological status of the Kharaa River in Northern Mongolia reported fine-grained sediments as being a major stress factor causing adverse impacts on the benthic ecology. However, the source of these sediments within the catchment as well as the specific impact on hyporheic zone functions in the Kharaa River remained unclear. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to investigate the underlying source-receptor system and implement an integrated monitoring approach. Suspended sediment sources within the Kharaa catchment were identified by using extensive spatially distributed sediment sampling and geochemical and isotope fingerprinting methods. On the receptor side, the ecological implications across a gradient of fine-grained sediment influx were analyzed using a distinct hyporheic zone monitoring scheme at three representative river reaches along the Kharaa River. Results of suspended sediment source monitoring show that during snowmelt runoff, riverbank and gully erosion were the dominant sources. During the summer period, upland erosion contributed a substantial share of suspended sediment. Fine-grained sediment influx proved to be the cause of habitat loss in the hyporheic zone and benthic oxygen production limitation. This combined catchment and in-stream monitoring approach will allow for a better understanding and spatially explicit analysis of the interactions of suspended sediment transport and hyporheic zone functioning. This information has built the basis for a coupled modeling framework that will help to develop efficient management measures within the Kharaa River basin with special emphasis on rapidly changing land-use and climatic conditions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000300251600015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSuspended%2Bsediments%2Bin%2Bthe%2BKharaa%2BRiver%2Bcatchment%2B%2528Mongolia%2529%2Band%2Bits%2Bimpact%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bfunctions%26rft.aufirst%3DMelanie%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DHartwig%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-011-1198-2%26rft.epage%3D1546%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1535-1546%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1535%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D65%26rft.au%3DHartwig%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DTheuring%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DBorchardt%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

15,"Danczak, RE",Dec 2016 ,Seasonal hyporheic dynamics control coupled microbiology and geochemistry in Colorado River sediments,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Riverbed microbial communities play an oversized role in many watershed ecosystem functions, including the processing of organic carbon, cycling of nitrogen, and alterations to metal mobility. The structure and activity of microbial assemblages depend in part on geochemical conditions set by river-groundwater exchange or hyporheic exchange. To assess how seasonal changes in river-groundwater mixing affect these populations in a snowmelt-dominated fluvial system, vertical sediment and pore water profiles were sampled at three time points at one location in the hyporheic zone of the Colorado River and analyzed by using geochemical measurements, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and ecological modeling. Oxic river water penetrated deepest into the subsurface during peak river discharge, while under base flow conditions, anoxic groundwater dominated shallower depths. Over a 70 cmthick interval, riverbed sediments were therefore exposed to seasonally fluctuating redox conditions and hosted microbial populations statistically different from those at both shallower and deeper locations. Additionally, microbial populations within this zone were shown to be the most dynamic across sampling time points, underlining the critical role that hyporheic mixing plays in constraining microbial abundances.

However, while the small-scale exchange induced by bed forms has been thoroughly investigated, the role of the larger features remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the hyporheic flows driven by the channel sinuosity in the intrameander zone. A physically based model is adopted to simulate the morphodynamic evolution of three different meandering rivers, from the first stages of the meander evolution until the incipient meander cutoff. For each stage, the sinuosity-driven intrameander hyporheic flow is computed. In this way, the hyporheic flow field, the fluxes exchanged with the river, and the residence times are described during the whole meander evolution. The main result concerns the existence of a remarkable zonation induced by the flow field in the intrameander zone. The more the meander evolves, the more the zonation becomes pronounced, and the probability distribution of the residence times shows a bimodal shape with an intermediate power law behavior. Some general rules governing the typical timescales of the intrameander hyporheic flow and the mean exchanged flux are also deduced.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000261889700005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW12428%26rft.atitle%3DIntra-meander%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bin%2Balluvial%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DRoberto%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DRevelli%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2008WR007081%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D44%26rft.au%3DRevelli%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DBoano%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DRidolfi%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"Lotts, WS",Apr 2022 ,Pipe Dreams: The Effects of Stream Bank Soil Pipes on Hyporheic Denitrification Caused by a Peak Flow Event,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Peak flow events in gaining stream/river channels cause lung model hyporheic exchange with the banks (bank storage), which fosters beneficial reactions as polluted channel water cycles through riparian groundwater. Soil pipes are common along stream/riverbanks, and enhance exchange, yet their effect on reactions such as denitrification is unknown. We used MODFLOW with the Conduit Flow Package to simulate lung model exchange during a peak flow event in a section of stream bank/riparian soil with soil pipes, and MT3D-USGS to estimate nitrate transport and denitrification. We varied soil matrix hydraulic conductivity (K) and first-order reaction constant (k), as well as soil pipe density, length, and height above the initial channel water surface elevation (H). The addition of soil pipes enhanced stream bank (riparian) denitrification relative to banks without pipes, e.g., a 76% increase due to adding a single 1.5 m pipe. Denitrification increased linearly with pipe density but exhibited nonlinear trends with other parameters. Sensitivity analysis revealed length and density to be most influential. Soil pipe enhancement of denitrification was governed by hyporheic volume in most cases in our study. Exceptions included (a) coarse soil (K = 10(-3) m/s) and (b) low k and H > 0. Scaling our results to the stream corridor scale estimated that five soil pipes per m cumulatively induced 3% nitrate removal along a 1 km reach. Overall, soil pipes enhanced advection of nitrate into the banks, and also increased residence times of that nitrate under certain conditions, which together enhanced denitrification. This enhancement has implications for excess nitrate management in watersheds.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000780888000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030312%26rft.atitle%3DPipe%2BDreams%253A%2BThe%2BEffects%2Bof%2BStream%2BBank%2BSoil%2BPipes%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BDenitrification%2BCaused%2Bby%2Ba%2BPeak%2BFlow%2BEvent%26rft.aufirst%3DW.%2BSeth%26rft.auinit%3DWS%26rft.aulast%3DLotts%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030312%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DLotts%252C%2BWS%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
18,"Pryshlak, TT",Nov 2015 ,Multiscale hyporheic exchange through strongly heterogeneous sediments,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity (K) and channel morphology both control surface water-groundwater exchange (hyporheic exchange), which influences stream ecosystem processes and bio-geochemical cycles. Here we show that heterogeneity in K is the dominant control on exchange rates, residence times, and patterns in hyporheic zones with abrupt lithologic contrasts. We simulated hyporheic exchange in a representative low-gradient stream with 300 different bimodal K fields composed of sand and silt. Simulations span five sets of sand-silt ratios and two sets of low and high K contrasts (1 and 3 orders of magnitude). Heterogeneity increases interfacial flux by an order of magnitude relative to homogeneous cases, drastically changes the shape of residence time distributions, and decreases median residence times. The positioning of highly permeable sand bodies controls patterns of interfacial flux and flow paths. These results are remarkably different from previous studies of smooth, continuous K fields that indicate only moderate effects on hyporheic exchange. Our results also show that hyporheic residence times are least predictable when sand body connectivity is low. As sand body connectivity increases, the expected residence time distribution (ensemble average for a given sand-silt ratio) remains approximately constant, but the uncertainty around the expectation decreases. Including strong heterogeneity in hyporheic models is imperative for understanding hyporheic fluxes and solute transport. In streams with strongly heterogeneous sediments, characterizing lithologic structure is more critical for predicting hyporheic exchange metrics than characterizing channel morphology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000368420000026,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMultiscale%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bthrough%2Bstrongly%2Bheterogeneous%2Bsediments%26rft.aufirst%3DTimothy%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DTT%26rft.aulast%3DPryshlak%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017293%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D9140%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D9127-9140%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D9127%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DPryshlak%252C%2BTT%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DSoltanian%252C%2BMR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We studied the relative contributions of the magnitude and direction of vertical hydrological exchange, subsurface sediment composition and interstitial physicochemistry in determining the distribution of hyporheic invertebrates in the Kye Burn, a fourth order gravel-bed stream in New Zealand.2. In winter 2000 and summer 2001, we measured vertical hydrological gradient (VHG), dissolved oxygen, water temperature and water chemistry using mini-piezometers, each installed in a different upwelling or downwelling zone. Next to every piezometer, a freeze core sample was taken to quantify the sediment, particulate organic matter and invertebrates.3. Dissolved oxygen concentration at 25 cm was high on both occasions (>9 mg L-1) but was higher in winter than summer. Interstitial water temperature was higher in down than upwellings and was substantially higher in summer than winter. Other features of the subsurface sediments and interstitial nitrate-nitrite concentrations were similar on both occasions and in up and downwellings. Interstitial ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorous concentrations were higher in winter than summer and ammonium was higher in up than downwelling areas.4. The proportion of fine sediment (63 mum(-1) mm), sediment heterogeneity and VHG accounted for the greatest proportion of variance in invertebrate distributions in both summer and winter.5. The hyporheos was numerically dominated by early instar leptophlebiid mayfly nymphs and asellotan isopods. Water mites were a taxonomically diverse group with 13 genera. Taxonomic diversity (Shannon-Weaver), but not taxon richness, was higher in upwelling areas, reflecting lower numerical dominance by a few taxa in these locations.6. Sediment composition (particularly the amount of fine sediments) and vertical hydrological exchange determined the composition and distribution of the hyporheos.

20,"Lewandowski, J",Nov 2019 ,Is the Hyporheic Zone Relevant beyond the Scientific Community?,WATER,"Rivers are important ecosystems under continuous anthropogenic stresses. The hyporheic zone is a ubiquitous, reactive interface between the main channel and its surrounding sediments along the river network. We elaborate on the main physical, biological, and biogeochemical drivers and processes within the hyporheic zone that have been studied by multiple scientific disciplines for almost half a century. These previous efforts have shown that the hyporheic zone is a modulator for most metabolic stream processes and serves as a refuge and habitat for a diverse range of aquatic organisms. It also exerts a major control on river water quality by increasing the contact time with reactive environments, which in turn results in retention and transformation of nutrients, trace organic compounds, fine suspended particles, and microplastics, among others. The paper showcases the critical importance of hyporheic zones, both from a scientific and an applied perspective, and their role in ecosystem services to answer the question of the manuscript title. It identifies major research gaps in our understanding of hyporheic processes.

21,"Taleb, A",Feb 2008 ,"The role of the hyporheic zone in the nitrogen dynamics of a semi-arid gravel bed stream located downstream of a heavily polluted reservoir (Tafna Wadi, Algeria)",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Nitrogen retention was measured along the Tafna wadi downstream of a heavily polluted reservoir in North-West Algeria to understand the role of the hyporheic zone (HZ) in nitrogen dynamics. Nutrient concentrations were measured monthly for 2 years within the bed sediments of a 300m reach located 20km downstream from the dam. Due to strong hydrological fluctuations hyporheic water was analysed during natural low and high water (HW) periods, and during water reservoir releases. Nutrient concentrations in surface water (SW) increased during water releases and in the HZ during the low water (LW) periods. Surface/hyporheic water interactions were characterized by determining the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and the chemical signature of the ground water (GW). The latter was obtained from regional GW monitoring. Hyporheic chemistry was strongly influenced by patterns of surface flow. Hyporheic and SWs had similar chloride concentrations during high flow when they were significantly lower than those of the regional GW. GW was generally richer in nitrates and nitrites, but was lower in ammonium concentrations than interstitial and river waters. Nitrates decreased significantly from upstream to downstream within the HZ throughout the hydrological period even though temporal fluctuations were high. Ammonium concentrations in interstitial water (IW) were significantly higher than in SW and generally increased from upstream to downstream. This study demonstrates the importance of the HZ in altering the dissolved inorganic nitrogen composition and concentrations of heavily polluted arid streams. The study is of interest because it documents a large 'natural experiment' that being the effect of periodic water release from a reservoir with serious water quality problems on the water quality dynamics (particularly nitrogen) of subsurface and SWs downstream.

22,"Chow, R",Jan 2020 ,Evaluating Subsurface Parameterization to Simulate Hyporheic Exchange: The Steinlach River Test Site,GROUNDWATER,"Hyporheic exchange is the interaction of river water and groundwater, and is difficult to predict. One of the largest contributions to predictive uncertainty for hyporheic exchange has been attributed to the representation of heterogeneous subsurface properties. Our study evaluates the trade-offs between intrinsic (irreducible) and epistemic (reducible) model errors when choosing between homogeneous and highly complex subsurface parameter structures. We modeled the Steinlach River Test Site in Southwest Germany using a fully coupled surface water-groundwater model to simulate hyporheic exchange and to assess the predictive errors and uncertainties of transit time distributions. A highly parameterized model was built, treated as a ""virtual reality"" and used as a reference. We found that if the parameter structure is too simple, it will be limited by intrinsic model errors. By increasing subsurface complexity through the addition of zones or heterogeneity, we can begin to exchange intrinsic for epistemic errors. Thus, the appropriate level of detail to represent the subsurface depends on the acceptable range of intrinsic structural errors for the given modeling objectives and the available site data. We found that a zonated model is capable of reproducing the transit time distributions of a more detailed model, but only if the geological structures are known. An interpolated heterogeneous parameter field (cf. pilot points) showed the best trade-offs between the two errors, indicating fitness for practical applications. Parameter fields generated by multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) produce transit time distributions with the largest uncertainties, however, these are reducible by additional hydrogeological data, particularly flux measurements.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000506131400014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluating%2BSubsurface%2BParameterization%2Bto%2BSimulate%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%253A%2BThe%2BSteinlach%2BRiver%2BTest%2BSite%26rft.aufirst%3DReynold%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DChow%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12884%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D109%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D93-109%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D93%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DChow%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DBennett%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DNowak%252C%2BW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
23,"Kruegler, J",Feb 2020 ,Dynamic Evapotranspiration Alters Hyporheic Flow and Residence Times in the Intrameander Zone,WATER,"Hyporheic zones (HZs) influence biogeochemistry at the local reach scale with potential implication for water quality at the large catchment scale. The characteristics of the HZs (e.g., area, flux rates, and residence times) change in response to channel and aquifer physical properties, as well as to transient perturbations in the stream-aquifer system such as floods and groundwater withdraws due to evapotranspiration (ET) and pumping. In this study, we use a numerical model to evaluate the effects of transient near-stream evapotranspiration (ET) on the area, exchange flux, and residence time (RT) of sinuosity-induced HZs modulated by regional groundwater flow (RGF). We found that the ET fluxes (up to 80 mm/day) consistently increased HZ area and exchange flux, and only increased RTs when the intensity of regional groundwater flow was low. Relative to simulations without ET, scenarios with active ET had more than double HZ area and exchange flux and about 20% longer residence times (as measured by the median of the residence time distribution). Our model simulations show that the drawdown induced by riparian ET increases the net flux of water from the stream to the nearby aquifer, consistent with field observations. The results also suggest that, along with ET intensity, the magnitude of the HZ response is influenced by the modulating effect of both gaining and losing RGF and the sensitivity of the aquifer to daily cycles of ET withdrawal. This work highlights the importance of representing near-stream ET when modeling sinuosity-induced hyporheic zones, as well as the importance of including riparian vegetation in efforts to restore the ecosystem functions of streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000519846500115,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B424%26rft.atitle%3DDynamic%2BEvapotranspiration%2BAlters%2BHyporheic%2BFlow%2Band%2BResidence%2BTimes%2Bin%2Bthe%2BIntrameander%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DKruegler%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12020424%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DKruegler%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DGomez-Velez%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BTA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

25,"Folegot, S",Feb 2018 ,Mesocosm experiments reveal the direction of groundwater-surface water exchange alters the hyporheic refuge capacity under warming scenarios,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Climate change is expected to affect hydrologic and thermal regimes of river ecosystems. During dry periods when river flows decrease and water temperatures increase, the hyporheic zone (HZ) can provide a refuge to surface aquatic invertebrates and enhance the resilience capacity of riverine ecosystems. However, shifts from up- to downwelling flow conditions in the HZ could jeopardise this capacity. Using laboratory mesocosms and high-resolution fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing, we explored the combined effects of five different increased surface water temperature treatments (from 15 to 27 degrees C at 3 degrees C intervals) and the direction of water exchange on the ability of Gammarus pulex (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Gammaridae) to migrate into the HZ as a response to warming. We determined the survival rates of this ubiquitous hyporheic dweller and its rates of consumption of alder (Alnus glutinosa; Betulaceae) leaf litter in the HZ. Results showed that at increasing surface water temperature, leaf-litter breakdown was observed at a greater depth in the sediments under downwelling flow conditions, that is, G.pulex migrated deeper into the HZ compared with upwelling conditions, resulting in greater survival rates (6411 vs. 44 +/- 10%). However, under both upwelling and downwelling conditions, we found evidence for potential use of the hyporheic zone as a thermal refuge for G.pulex. Below sediment depths of 25cm, temperatures remained low (<22 degrees C) even when surface waters were at 27 degrees C, so temperatures deep in the hyporheic zone never exceeded critical thermal thresholds for G.pulex. This study provides evidence that alterations to the direction of groundwater-surface water exchange can alter the capacity of the HZ to provide a refuge for benthic invertebrates, thereby affecting the resilience of river communities to warming under climate change.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000419638400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMesocosm%2Bexperiments%2Breveal%2Bthe%2Bdirection%2Bof%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Balters%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Brefuge%2Bcapacity%2Bunder%2Bwarming%2Bscenarios%26rft.aufirst%3DSilvia%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFolegot%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffwb.13049%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D177%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D165-177%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D165%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D63%26rft.au%3DFolegot%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
26,"Lotts, WS",Feb 2020 ,Filling the Void: The Effect of Stream Bank Soil Pipes on Transient Hyporheic Exchange During a Peak Flow Event,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone is the ecotone between stream and river channel flow and groundwater that can process nutrients and improve water quality. Transient hyporheic zones occur in the riparian zone (bank storage or ""lung model"" exchange) during channel stage fluctuations. Recent studies show that soil pipes are widespread in stream banks and beneath floodplains, creating highly preferential flow between channel and riparian groundwater such that the traditional Darcy model of flow does not apply. We used MODFLOW with the conduit flow package to model a series of stream bank soil pipes and examined soil pipe density (number per m), length, diameter, height above baseflow water surface, connectivity, and matrix hydraulic conductivity on transient particle flow paths and total hyporheic exchange volume (i.e., bank storage) over the course of a peak flow (e.g., storm) event. We found that adding five soil pipes per meter more than doubled hyporheic volume. Soil pipe length was the most important control; adding one 1.5-m-long soil pipe caused a 73.4% increase in hyporheic volume. The effect of increasing soil pipe diameter on hyporheic volume leveled off at similar to 1 cm, as flow limitation switched from pipe flow to pipe-matrix exchange. To validate our approach, we used the model to successfully reproduce trends from field studies. Our results highlight the need to consider soil pipes when modeling, monitoring, or managing bank storage, floodplain connectivity, or hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000535672800067,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR025959%26rft.atitle%3DFilling%2Bthe%2BVoid%253A%2BThe%2BEffect%2Bof%2BStream%2BBank%2BSoil%2BPipes%2Bon%2BTransient%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BDuring%2Ba%2BPeak%2BFlow%2BEvent%26rft.aufirst%3DWilliam%2BSeth%26rft.auinit%3DWS%26rft.aulast%3DLotts%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025959%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DLotts%252C%2BWS%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"Cadbury, SL",Jan 2008 ,Stream temperature dynamics within a New Zealand glacierized river basin,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Knowledge of river thermal dynamics for glacierized basins is limited, despite the high sensitivity of these systems to climatic change/variability. This study examined spatio-temporal water column and streambed temperature dynamics within a New Zealand glacierized river basin over two melt seasons. Water column temperature was recorded at three sites along the mainstem channel and four hill slope/groundwater-fed tributaries. Air temperature, precipitation and stream discharge were monitored to characterize hydroclimatological conditions. Streambed temperature was monitored at the upper and lower main river sites at 0.05, 0.2 and 0.4 m depth. Water column temperature rose on average 0.6 degrees C km(-1) along the glacier-fed mainstem. Temperature was elevated during warmer periods but the downstream increase was reduced clue to greater meltwater production (consequently a larger total stream flow volume for atmospheric heating) plus a proportional reduction in warmer groundwater contributions. Hillslope/groundwater-fed tributaries yielded a range of temperature patterns, indicating variable sourcing (meltwater or rainfall) and residence times. In the upper basin, streambed temperature was warmer than the water column, suggesting groundwater upwelling; however, during high runoff events, water column and streambed temperature converged, indicating downwelling/heat advection by channel water. At the lower site, streambed temperature mirrored the water column, suggesting greater surface water/atmospheric influences. Key drivers of stream thermal regime were: (1) relative water source contributions, (2) prevailing hydroclimatological conditions, (3) distance from source, (4) total stream flow volume and (5) basin factors (specifically, valley/channel geomorphology and riparian forest). High magnitude precipitation events produced a contrasting stream thermal response to that reported elsewhere. In contrast to European alpine research, streams showed a reduced thermal range owing to the relatively mild, wet melt season climate. This New Zealand case study highlights the importance of understanding basin-specific modification of energy and hydrological fluxes for accurate prediction of stream thermal dynamics/habitat and ecological response to climatic variability and change.

28,"Stubbington, R",Jul 2011 ,Benthic and hyporheic invertebrate community responses to seasonal flow recession in a groundwater-dominated stream,ECOHYDROLOGY,"Natural hydrological variability in lotic ecosystems can include prolonged periods of flow recession. A reduction in discharge is accompanied by abiotic changes in benthic and hyporheic habitats, often including reductions in habitat availability. Whilst the benthic invertebrate community response to low flows is well documented, little research has considered how the composition of the community within the hyporheic zone is affected. We examined benthic and hyporheic invertebrate community composition during flow recession in a temperate karst stream, at sites with contrasting historic flow permanence regimes. Changes in benthic invertebrate community composition primarily reflected changes in habitat availability associated with discharge variability; in particular, the population density of the dominant amphipod, Gammarus pulex, increased as the area of submerged benthic sediments declined. Concurrent significant increases in the hyporheic abundance of G. pulex, and moderate increase in the proportion of the total G. pulex population inhabiting the hyporheic zone were recorded. It is postulated that G. pulex migrated into the hyporheic zone to reduce exposure to intensifying biological interactions in the benthic sediments. An increase in the hyporheic abundance of G. pulex was particularly pronounced at sites with historic intermittent flow, which could be attributed to downwelling stream water dominating vertical hydrologic exchange. The increase in G. pulex abundance reduced community diversity in the benthic sediments, but had no apparent detrimental effects on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages.

29,"Marciniak, M",Aug 2022 ,Parametric study of fluidization conditions of bed sediments in the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The phenomenon of fluidization of the bed sediment of the hyporheic zone involves the production of dynamic suspension of solid particles in a stream of water flowing in the direction opposite to gravity. Fluidization may be permanent; then, it becomes a spring or a headwater zone, where groundwater discharge rate is almost unchanged within an entire hydrological year. But it can also occur periodically, depending on the changing hydrodynamic conditions. In such cases, the fluidization of the bed sediment of the hyporheic zone may disturb its functioning by changing the conditions of surface water and groundwater exchange. The disturbances affect hydrodynamic and hydrochemical processes connected with water exchange, but first of all, the living conditions of hyporheic zone flora and fauna. Therefore, the phenomenon of fluidization is significant for broadly understood ecology of the hyporheic zone. The paper presents the analysis of conditions of fluidization occurrence depending on the main hydrodynamic parameters that may affect this process. The authors analysed the influence of the difference in water level between the drained aquifer and the river, the hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy of the aquifer, the vertical hydraulic conductivity in the hyporheic zone, thickness of the hyporheic zone, and the width of the river on the possibility of fluidization of the bed sediment of the hyporheic zone. The range of variability of particular parameters corresponds to the actual variability of those parameters in natural conditions. It was proved that the fluidization of the bed sediment of the hyporheic zone mostly depends on: water level difference, hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, and value of vertical hydraulic conductivity in the hyporheic zone. The other parameters have little influence on this process.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000849925200007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14650%26rft.atitle%3DParametric%2Bstudy%2Bof%2Bfluidization%2Bconditions%2Bof%2Bbed%2Bsediments%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DMarek%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DMarciniak%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14650%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DMarciniak%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DKaczmarek%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DSzczucinska%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
30,"Pepin, DM",Sep 2002 ,Benthic responses to groundwater-surface water exchange in 2 alluvial rivers in northwestern Montana,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"We tested the hypotheses that groundwater-surface water exchange regimes affect spatial distribution of algal biomass and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa in main-channel riffle habitats of 2 northwestern Montana rivers flowing through alluvial flood plains. We used a stratified random design to sample riffles with contrasting groundwater-surface water exchange regimes, but with similar bedform, current velocity, and substrata grain size. We examined general patterns of exchange between river channel and hyporheic zone waters by measuring vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) and hydraulic conductivities using mini-piezometers. Riffles near the upstream limit of each flood plain were characterized by strong, hyporheic recharge (-VHG, down-welling), whereas riffles throughout the lower half of each flood plain were characterized by weak, dispersed hyporheic discharge (+VHG, upwelling). There were no differences in mean seston concentrations between riffles on either flood plain within any season. Although mean algal biomass was not significantly different across seasons, maximum biomass was generally higher in upwelling zone riffles (+VHG) than in downwelling zone riffles (-VHG). Variation in algal standing crop in upwelling riffles was similar to30% greater than in downwelling riffles. There was no difference in mean EPT density between upwelling and downwelling sites. However, there were species-specific responses to differential hyporheic exchange, which were correlated with differences in algal biomass and VHG. The results of our study suggest that hyporheic exchange patterns influence physical habitat structure of main-channel riffles, and affect the distribution and abundance of algae and EPT macroinvertebrates in these habitats.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000177578100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBenthic%2Bresponses%2Bto%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bin%2B2%2Balluvial%2Brivers%2Bin%2Bnorthwestern%2BMontana%26rft.aufirst%3DDM%26rft.auinit%3DDM%26rft.aulast%3DPepin%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468476%26rft.epage%3D383%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D370-383%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D370%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DPepin%252C%2BDM%26rft.au%3DHauer%252C%2BFR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
31,"Hoagland, B",Dec 11 2020 ,Groundwater-Stream Connectivity Mediates Metal(loid) Geochemistry in the Hyporheic Zone of Streams Impacted by Historic Mining and Acid Rock Drainage,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"High concentrations of trace metal(loid)s exported from abandoned mine wastes and acid rock drainage pose a risk to the health of aquatic ecosystems. To determine if and when the hyporheic zone mediates metal(loid) export, we investigated the relationship between streamflow, groundwater-stream connectivity, and subsurface metal(loid) concentrations in two similar to 1-km stream reaches within the Bonita Peak Mining District, a US Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site located near Silverton, Colorado, USA. The hyporheic zones of reaches in two streams-Mineral Creek and Cement Creek-were characterized using a combination of salt-tracer injection tests, transient-storage modeling, and geochemical sampling of the shallow streambed (<0.7m). Based on these data, we present two conceptual models for subsurface metal(loid) behavior in the hyporheic zones, including (1) well-connected systems characterized by strong hyporheic mixing of infiltrating stream water and upwelling groundwater and (2) poorly connected systems delineated by physical barriers that limit hyporheic mixing. The comparatively large hyporheic zone and high hydraulic conductivities of Mineral Creek created a connected stream-groundwater system, where mixing of oxygen-rich stream water and metal-rich groundwater facilitated the precipitation of metal colloids in the shallow subsurface. In Cement Creek, the precipitation of iron oxides at depth (similar to 0.4m) created a low-hydraulic-conductivity barrier between surface water and groundwater. Cemented iron oxides were an important regulator of metal(loid) concentrations in this poorly connected stream-groundwater system due to the formation of strong redox gradients induced by a relatively small hyporheic zone and high fluid residence times. A comparison of conceptual models to streamconcentration-discharge relationships exhibited a clear link between geochemical processes occurring within the hyporheic zone of the well-connected system and export of particulate Al, Cu, Fe, and Mn, while the poorly connected system did not have a notable influence on metal concentration-discharge trends. Mineral Creek is an example of a hyporheic system that serves as a natural dissolved metal(loid) sink, whereas poorly connected systems such as Cement Creek may require a combination of subsurface remediation of sediments and mitigation of upstream, iron-rich mine drainages to reduce metal export.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000659452300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B600409%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater-Stream%2BConnectivity%2BMediates%2BMetal%2528loid%2529%2BGeochemistry%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2Bof%2BStreams%2BImpacted%2Bby%2BHistoric%2BMining%2Band%2BAcid%2BRock%2BDrainage%26rft.aufirst%3DBeth%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DHoagland%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2020.600409%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D2%26rft.au%3DHoagland%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DNavarre-Sitchler%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DSingha%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
32,"JONES, JB",Apr 1995 ,VERTICAL HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE AND ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM IN A SONORAN DESERT STREAM,ECOLOGY,"Hyporheic metabolism in a Sonoran Desert stream was examined, focusing on the sources of detritus supporting hyporheic respiration. Two alternative hypotheses were specifically addressed: (1) organic matter derived from the surface stream supports hyporheic respiration, and (2) detritus buried during flash floods supports hyporheic respiration. As predicted for the surface-derived organic matter hypothesis, respiration was lowest immediately following flash floods and increased significantly with time after flood (P < 0.001). Hyporheic respiration ranged from 0.05 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) immediately following a flash flood to as high as 4.41 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1) late in algal succession. Respiration was significantly correlated with surface algal biomass during two spring/summer successional sequences (P < 0.05; partial correlation coefficients 0.58 and 0.88). Respiration was also consistently higher in downwelling than upwelling zones with overall mean rates of 1.12 and 0.46 mgO(2) . L sediments(-1). h(-1), respectively. Respiration exhibited a distinct diel pattern with highest rate coinciding with time of maximum photosynthesis and was also significantly correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentration (P < 0.05), further supporting the hypothesis of hyporheic dependence on algal production. Flash floods bury organic matter that is also respired in the hyporheic zone; however, based upon storage of organic carbon immediately following floods, an average of only 15% of the observed respiration could be supported. We conclude that hyporheic respiration in Sycamore Creek is tightly linked to surface production. It is spatially distributed in biotic ''hot spots'' where surface waters enter hyporheic sediments and is most likely supported by organic matter that is supplied as dissolved organic carbon, perhaps from algal production.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1995QU35800023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVERTICAL%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BEXCHANGE%2BAND%2BECOSYSTEM%2BMETABOLISM%2BIN%2BA%2BSONORAN%2BDESERT%2BSTREAM%26rft.aufirst%3DJB%26rft.auinit%3DJB%26rft.aulast%3DJONES%26rft.date%3D1995%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1939358%26rft.epage%3D952%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-9658%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D942-952%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D942%26rft.stitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D76%26rft.au%3DJONES%252C%2BJB%26rft.au%3DFISHER%252C%2BSG%26rft.au%3DGRIMM%252C%2BNB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Hyporheic macroinvertebrates were sampled using a series of PVC wells driven into parafluvial bars in the three stream types. Benthic invertebrates were collected using Hess samples from the stream channel adjacent to parafluvial well locations to compare surface macroinvertebrate communities to that of the hyporheic communities. Temperature, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and total nitrogen concentrations were significantly higher in the brownwater stream compared to the other stream types. Hyporheic macroinvertebrate density was 88% higher in the brownwater stream, despite significantly lower dissolved oxygen concentrations, Benthic macroinvertebrate density was 95% greater in the brownwater stream type than the benthos of the two other stream types. Benthic and hyporheic samples were collector-gatherer driven and the hyporheic zone was functionally more diverse than the benthic habitat with a similar taxa composition across all habitats and stream types. The study of aquatic ecosystems is especially important in Southeast Alaska, where the temperate rainforests are still relatively un-disturbed, and most watersheds still have healthy salmon runs.

A network of wells was established to measure water table elevations and to collect water samples to analyze dissolved nitrogen concentrations. Hydraulic conductivity and the depth to bedrock were surveyed. We parameterized the groundwater flow model, MODFLOW, to quantify subsurface flows of both stream water and soil water through the hyporheic zone. MODFLOW simulations suggest that soil water inflow from the adjacent hill slope increased by 1.7-fold during a small storm. Dissolved organic nitrogen ( DON) and ammonium NH4+ in soil water from the hill slope were the dominant nitrogen inputs to the riparian zone. DON was consumed via mineralization to NH4+ in the hyporheic zone. NH4+ was the dominant nitrogen species in the subsurface, and showed a net release during both base and storm flow. Nitrate appeared to be lost to denitrification or immobilized by microorganisms and/or vegetation in the riparian zone.

Hyporheic physico-chemistry and invertebrates were compared among small streams draining hill-country catchments under pasture, exotic pine forest, and native forest near Hamilton, New Zealand. In streams draining native forest, the hyporheic zone harboured a relatively diverse invertebrate fauna comprising mostly taxa common in the surface benthos, although a few apparently obligate hyporheic taxa (ostracods, blind amphipods) were collected. Few individuals and taxa occupied the hyporheic zones of streams draining pasture with some groups such as water mites conspicuously absent. The hyporheos of the stream in exotic pine forest was similar in richness and abundance to that of the pasture streams. Hyporheic water temperatures were significantly higher in the pasture streams than those in pine or native forest. There were strong positive correlations between percentage saturation of dissolved oxygen in the hyporheic zones of all streams and both species richness and total invertebrate abundance. We suggest that land clearance for pasture leads to hill slumping and siltation that bury the lateral bars along the stream channels, rendering this habitat unsuitable for hyporheic invertebrates. Channel narrowing and incision may physically remove further hyporheic habitat, and the reduction of flushing flows to remove interstitial silt and clay leads to low hyporheic dissolved oxygen concentrations and reduced colonisation by surface benthos.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000071947900004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLand-use%2Beffects%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Becology%2Bof%2Bfive%2Bsmall%2Bstreams%2Bnear%2BHamilton%252C%2BNew%2BZealand%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F00288330.1997.9516793%26rft.epage%3D622%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0028-8330%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DNEW%2BZEALAND%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMARINE%2BAND%2BFRESHWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D609-622%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D609%26rft.stitle%3DNEW%2BZEAL%2BJ%2BMAR%2BFRESH%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DScarsbrook%252C%2BMR%26rft.au%3DBurrell%252C%2BGP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=NEW+ZEALAND+JOURNAL+OF+MARINE+AND+FRESHWATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Water samples were collected monthly from the stream and a well network during base flow periods. We examined the potential for mixing of different source waters to explain concentrations of DOC and DIC. We did not find convincing evidence that either inputs of deep groundwater or lateral inputs of shallow soil water influenced carbon dynamics. Rather, carbon dynamics appeared to be controlled by local processes in the hyporheic zone and overlying riparian soils. DOC concentrations were low in stream water (0.04-0.09 mM), and decreased with nominal travel time through the hyporheic zone (0.02-0.04 mM lost over 100 h). Conversely, stream water DIC concentrations were much greater than DOC (0.35-0.7 mM) and increased with nominal travel time through the hyporheic zone (0.2-0.4 mM gained over 100 h). DOC in stream water could only account for 10% of the observed increase in DIC. In situ metabolic processing of buried particulate organic matter as well as advection of CO2 from the vadose zone likely accounted for the remaining 90% of the increase in DIC. Overall, the hyporheic zone was a source of DIC to the stream. We suggest that, in mountain stream networks, hyporheic exchange facilitates the transformation of particulate organic carbon buried in floodplains and transports the DIC that is produced back to the stream where it can be evaded to the atmosphere.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000388493400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCarbon%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Bmountain%2Bstream%2Bin%2Bthe%2BCascade%2BMountains%252C%2BOregon%26rft.aufirst%3DHayley%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DHA%26rft.aulast%3DCorson-Rikert%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR019303%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7576%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7556-7576%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7556%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D52%26rft.au%3DCorson-Rikert%252C%2BHA%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DSantelmann%252C%2BMV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
38,"Calles, O",Oct 2007 ,Temporal and spatial variation in quality of hyporheic water in one unregulated and two regulated boreal rivers,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"This study describes the temporal and spatial variations in hyporheic water quality in three boreal rivers, the River Tobyalven, an unregulated river, the river Mangalven, a regulated river with a minimum discharge requirement and the river Jarperudsalven, a regulated river without any minimum discharge requirements. A total of 43 permanent piezometers were used to measure dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, NO3- and NH4+ in the hyporheic water at 150 mm and 300 mm depth, at monthly intervals from October 2001 to October 2002. Another seven piezometers were installed in brown trout redds and monitored during the incubation period, from December 2001 to April 2002. In the river Tobyalven, temporal patterns in hyporheic water chemistry correlated to variations in surface water chemistry and discharge. In the river Jarperudsalven, the hyporheic water chemistry did not correlate to discharge or surface water chemistry. In the river Mangalven, the water chemistry was dominated by releases from a large upstream lake, and there were weak correlations between surface water chemistry and hyporheic water chemistry at some sites. The incubation conditions for brown trout eggs were most favourable in the unregulated river, characterized by high DO levels that remained high throughout the incubation period. In the river Jarperudsalven the DO levels were variable during spawning, and then gradually declined to critically low levels during incubation, whereas in the river Mangalven the DO conditions were intermediate and stable. Thus we observed a stronger coupling between surface water conditions and hyporheic conditions, i.e. vertical connectivity, in the unregulated river than in the regulated river with minimum flow requirements, which in turn was stronger than in the river without minimum flow requirements.

39,"Jin, GQ",Mar 15 2019 ,Colloid transport and distribution in the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Colloids moving from the stream into the hyporheic zone may have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems as they are potential contaminants or carriers of contaminants. Moreover, retained colloids in the hyporheic zone could not only reduce the exchange flux between the stream and streambed but also change the conditions of the bed, affecting the habitats for aquatic organisms. Previous studies focused on the exchange flux across the sediment-water interface, but the colloid transport processes and distribution of retained colloids in the streambed have received little attention. We conducted experiments within a laboratory flume to examine these processes in a streambed driven by bedform-induced hyporheic flow. Retained colloids measured in the bed at the end of the experiments revealed colloid retention mainly in the shallow layer of hyporheic zone (0-5 cm below the interface). The results demonstrated significant effects of particle trapping and settling on the colloid transport and distribution in the streambed. Retention leads to the formation of a colloid-filled shallow layer in the bed. Particle paths based on model simulations showed that colloid settling in pore water modifies the direction of colloid transport and allows the colloid particles to move more deeply in the bed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000460470500004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DColloid%2Btransport%2Band%2Bdistribution%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DGuangqiu%26rft.auinit%3DGQ%26rft.aulast%3DJin%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13375%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D944%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D932-944%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D932%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D33%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BZT%26rft.au%3DBarry%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
40,"Kaufman, MH",Aug 2017 ,Hyporheic hot moments: Dissolved oxygen dynamics in the hyporheic zone in response to surface flow perturbations,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a key environmental variable that drives and feeds back with numerous processes. In the aquatic sediment that makes up the hyporheic zone, DO may exhibit pronounced spatial gradients and complex patterns which control the distribution of a series of redox processes. Yet, little is known regarding the dynamics of hyporheic zone DO, especially under transitional flow regimes. Considering the natural tendency of rivers to be highly responsive to external forcing, these temporal dynamics are potentially just as important and pronounced as the spatial gradients. Here we use laboratory flume experiments and multiphysics flow and reactive transport modeling to investigate surface flow controls on the depth of oxygen penetration in the bed as well as the area of oxygenated sediment. We show that the hyporheic zone DO conditions respond over time scales of hours-to-days when subjected to practically instantaneous surface flow perturbations. Additionally, the flume experiments demonstrate that hyporheic zone DO conditions respond faster to surface flow acceleration than to deceleration. Finally, we found that the morphology of the dissolved oxygen plume front depends on surface flow acceleration or deceleration. This study thus shows that the highly dynamic nature of typical streams and rivers drives equally dynamic redox conditions in the hyporheic zone. Because the redox conditions and their distribution within the hyporheic zone are important from biological, ecological, and contaminant perspectives, this hyporheic redox dynamism has the potential to impact system scale aquatic chemical cycles.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000411202000018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bhot%2Bmoments%253A%2BDissolved%2Boxygen%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bin%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Bsurface%2Bflow%2Bperturbations%26rft.aufirst%3DMatthew%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DMH%26rft.aulast%3DKaufman%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2016WR020296%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6662%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6642-6662%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6642%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D53%26rft.au%3DKaufman%252C%2BMH%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DCook%252C%2BPLM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Liu, DS",Jun 2018 ,Dynamic processes of hyporheic exchange and temperature distribution in the riparian zone in response to dam-induced water fluctuations,GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL,"We examined the dynamic processes of hyporheic exchange and temperature distribution in a riparian zone in response to low-temperature water fluctuations downstream of the Xin'an River Dam, China, using analytical and mainly hydrodynamic methods. For this purpose, we installed six HM21 piezometers (R, P1-P5) between the river water and the groundwater at an interval of approximately 2 m perpendicular to the flow path. We also installed 20 PT100 thermistors (T1-T20) along the transect at depths of 1.19 m to 3.58 m and monitored the temperatures of river and air. Water levels and temperatures were automatically logged every 5 min by the real-time system from November to December 2014 and sent to the remote platform through the remote terminal unit. Results revealed that the intensity and direction of the hyporheic exchange (Q) between the river water and the groundwater varied periodically (t = 1 d) with the water level of the river. In each cycle, the Q was in a counterclockwise loop curve with the water level of the river and with the non-uniform distribution along the transect perpendicular to the river, which showed that the farther the lateral exchange was away from the river, the lower its intensity and the more hysteretic the alteration of its direction. The daily exchange width and residence time had no necessary connection with the average river stage, but mainly depended on the amplitude of the fluctuating river stage and the duration of river infiltration and established a strong linear relationship with their product. The temperature distribution of the riparian aquifer was mainly affected by the surface radiation and river water infiltration. It was characterized as ""cool on the surface and warm at the bottom"" in the vertical direction and could be divided into low-, medium-, and high-temperature zones along the horizontal direction. The horizontal infiltration distance (L) increased by power functions with the increase in infiltration rate (v) and decrease in river temperature (T).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000431995700008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDynamic%2Bprocesses%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Btemperature%2Bdistribution%2Bin%2Bthe%2Briparian%2Bzone%2Bin%2Bresponse%2Bto%2Bdam-induced%2Bwater%2Bfluctuations%26rft.aufirst%3DDongsheng%26rft.auinit%3DDS%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12303-017-0065-x%26rft.eissn%3D1598-7477%26rft.epage%3D475%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1226-4806%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOSCIENCES%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D465-475%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D465%26rft.stitle%3DGEOSCI%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BDS%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DFeng%252C%2BMM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=GEOSCIENCES+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Singley, JG",May 2021 ,The Role of Hyporheic Connectivity in Determining Nitrogen Availability: Insights From an Intermittent Antarctic Stream,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Due to widespread manipulation of nitrogen (N), much research has focused on processes controlling the fate of anthropogenic N in streams. Yet, in a variety of oligotrophic systems, N fixed by periphyton is a significant driver of ecosystem metabolism. Due to difficulties partitioning allochthonous and autochthonous sources, there is limited information regarding how the latter is processed. Autochthonous N may be particularly important in alpine, arid, or polar environments. We test the hypothesis that the availability of remineralized autochthonous N is controlled by connectivity between the hyporheic zone and main channel due to the contrasting biogeochemical functions of benthic autotrophs (including N-fixing Nostoc) and hyporheic heterotrophs in an intermittent Antarctic stream. There, we collected surface water and hyporheic water concurrently at 4-6 h intervals over a 32.5 h period during one flow season and opportunistically throughout a second. Hyporheic water had 7 to 30 times greater nitrate-N concentrations relative to surface water across all flow conditions. In contrast, ammonium concentrations were generally lower, although similar among locations. Additionally, nitrate in hyporheic water was positively correlated with silica, an indicator of hyporheic residence time. A laboratory assay confirmed prior inferences that hyporheic microbial communities possess the functional potential to perform nitrification. Together, these findings suggest that remineralized autochthonous N accumulates in the hyporheic zone even as streamflow varies and likely subsidizes stream N availability, which supports prior inferences from N stable isotope data at this site. These results highlight the importance of hyporheic connectivity in controlling autochthonous N cycling and availability in streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000655232300007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021JG006309%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BRole%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BConnectivity%2Bin%2BDetermining%2BNitrogen%2BAvailability%253A%2BInsights%2BFrom%2Ban%2BIntermittent%2BAntarctic%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DJG%26rft.aulast%3DSingley%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021JG006309%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D126%26rft.au%3DSingley%252C%2BJG%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BMN%26rft.au%3DHinckley%252C%2BES&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Capderrey, C",Dec 2013 ,Invertebrate distribution across nested geomorphic features in braided-river landscapes,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"River landscapes are increasingly viewed as a collection of nested geomorphic features, the hydrological effects of which juxtapose to create a mosaic of aquatic habitat conditions. We examined how the combined hydrological influences of stream reaches and gravel bars affect the composition of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages along the longitudinal and vertical dimensions of river landscapes. We worked in 12 braided-river valley segments of tributaries to the Rhone River, France. Valley segments were bounded downstream by geological knickpoints so that bedform-induced exchange flows beneath gravel bars and riffles were predictably embedded in exchange flows occurring at the valley-segment scale. In upstream reaches (UR) and downstream reaches (DR) of each valley segment, we collected invertebrates at the heads and tails of gravel bars in the hyporheic zone and at the upstream and downstream ends of riffles in surface channels adjacent to the bars. Patterns of vertical hydraulic gradient and specific conductance and the resulting spatial heterogeneity of temperature, dissolved O-2, and particulate organic C suggested that DR were points of flow convergence and water mixing. Specific conductance increased and temperature decreased more steeply along gravel bars in DR, indicating that water from long hyporheic flow paths or lateral aquifers was discharging at the tails of bars in DR. Density hotspots for insect larvae corresponded to hyporheic patches at the heads of bars in DR, which received the highest organic matter inputs from localized downwelling of surface water and were not affected by inputs of cold water from hyporheic flow paths or lateral aquifers. Density of epigean taxa at the tails of bars decreased more steeply with depth in DR than in UR, and density of hypogean taxa increased more steeply. Viewing local hyporheic assemblages as the outcome of a series of environmental filters operating over multiple exchange flows induced by nested geomorphic features provides a general framework that may foster our understanding of biodiversity patterns in river landscapes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000326930000012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInvertebrate%2Bdistribution%2Bacross%2Bnested%2Bgeomorphic%2Bfeatures%2Bin%2Bbraided-river%2Blandscapes%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DCapderrey%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F12-188.1%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D1204%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1188-1204%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1188%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DCapderrey%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DMalard%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

45,"Shrivastava, S",Dec 2020 ,Distribution of clay-sized sediments in streambeds and influence of fine sediment clogging on hyporheic exchange,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"In this work, the deposition of clay-sized fine particles (d(50) = 0.006 mm) and its subsequent influence on the dune-induced hyporheic exchange are investigated. Fine sand (D-50 = 0.28 mm), coarse sand (D-50 = 1.7 mm), and gravel (D-50 = 5.5 mm) grains were used to form homogenous model streambeds; one control - no clay input, and two treatments - increasing clay inputs for each grain type. The results indicate that the clogging profiles of clay-sized sediments may not be predicted accurately using the previously proposed metric based on the relative sizes of infiltrating and substrate sediments. Further, the depositional patterns vary with the initial concentration of clay particles in the surface water. The assessment of clogging profiles in coarse-grained model streambeds also reveals a preferential infiltration of the clay particles in the hyporheic downwelling regions. The results from the dye tracer test suggest that the accumulation of clay particles altered the exchange characteristics in the treatment flumes. For each grain size, the treatment flumes exhibit lower hyporheic flux and higher median residence times compared to their respective control flumes. The dye penetration depths were lower in treatment flumes with fine and coarse sand compared to their respective control flumes. Interestingly, higher penetration depths were observed in treatment flumes with gravel compared to their respective control flume potentially due to the generation of preferential flow paths in the partially clogged gravel beds. The clogging altered the hyporheic fluxes and residence times in the coarse-grained model beds to a greater degree in comparison to the fine sand beds. Overall, our findings indicate that the properties of both fine and substrate sediments influence the clogging patterns in streambeds, and the subsequent influence of fine sediment clogging on hyporheic exchange and associated processes may vary across stream ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000594079200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDistribution%2Bof%2Bclay-sized%2Bsediments%2Bin%2Bstreambeds%2Band%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bfine%2Bsediment%2Bclogging%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DShivansh%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DShrivastava%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13988%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D5685%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D26%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5674-5685%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5674%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DShrivastava%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DStewardson%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DArora%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Although hyporheic invertebrates contribute little biomass and respiration relative to microbes in stream sediments, invertebrate effects on biogeochemical processes may be disproportionately large. We tested how various interstitial invertebrate assemblages affected N cycling and respiration in flow-through microcosms filled with alluvial sediment in the laboratory. Average invertebrate biomasses in low and high invertebrate treatments were 0.20 and 19 mg dry mass/L sediment, respectively. Average net NO3- regeneration/uptake rate increased with increasing invertebrate biomass, showing invertebrates suppressed NO3- uptake or stimulated in situ NO3- production. Average respiration (normalized for sediment organic matter) and particulate organic matter (POM) increased 51.9% and 33%, respectively, with increasing invertebrate biomass, suggesting direct contribution to hyporheic metabolism and/or stimulation of microbial activity and an accumulation of POM driven by invertebrates.

47,"Menichino, GT",Jun 2014 ,Hydraulic and thermal effects of in-stream structure-induced hyporheic exchange across a range of hydraulic conductivities,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"In-stream structure-induced hyporheic exchange and associated thermal dynamics affect stream ecosystems. Their importance is controlled by spatial variability of sediment hydraulic conductivity (K). We calibrated a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of surface and groundwater hydraulics near a channel-spanning weir (represents log dams, boulder weirs) to field data and varied K from 10(-7) to 10(-2) m/s (silt to gravel). Surface water stopped cresting the weir for K>10(-3) m/s. Non-Darcy hyporheic flow was also prevalent for K > 10(-3) m/s, and velocity errors using non-CFD models ranged up to 32.2%. We also modeled weir-induced heat transport during summer. As K increased from 10(-7) to 10(-3) m/s, weir-induced hyporheic heat advection steadily increased. Cooling and buffering along hyporheic flow paths decreased with increasing K, particularly above K=10(-5) and 10(-4) m/s, respectively. Vertical heat conduction between surface water and groundwater near the weir decreased with increasing K, particularly for K>10(-5) m/s. Conduction between hyporheic flow paths and adjacent groundwater helped cool hyporheic flow. Downstream surface water cooling by hyporheic advection increased steadily with K as increases in hyporheic flow overwhelmed decreases in cooling along hyporheic flow paths. Yet such effects were small (0.016 degrees C) even at K=10(-3) m/s. The largest thermal effect of weir-induced exchange was therefore spatial expansion of subsurface diel variability (particularly for K>10(-5) m/s) which affects benthic habitat and chemical reactions. The specific values of K where such trend shifts occur is likely variable among streams based on flow conditions, but we expect the presence of such trend shifts to be widespread.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000340430400006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydraulic%2Band%2Bthermal%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bin-stream%2Bstructure-induced%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bacross%2Ba%2Brange%2Bof%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivities%26rft.aufirst%3DGarrett%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DGT%26rft.aulast%3DMenichino%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013WR014758%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4661%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4643-4661%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4643%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DMenichino%252C%2BGT%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Buxton, TH",Aug 2015 ,Modeling the influence of salmon spawning on hyporheic exchange of marine-derived nutrients in gravel stream beds,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Salmon that spawn in streams deliver marine-derived nutrients (MDN) that catalyze trophic productivity and support rearing juvenile salmon. Salmon spawning also affects hyporheic exchange and movement of dissolved MDN through the stream bed by creating redd topography that induces pumping exchange and by winnowing fine sediment and loosening the bed, which alters hydraulic conductivity and bed porosity. The spatial extent of spawning within the channel likely governs the volume and rate of dissolved MDN exchanged with the stream bed through this process. To explore this issue, we used a two-dimensional groundwater model to predict changes in hyporheic volume, flux, and mean hydraulic residence time of dissolved MDN as a function of the proportion of the bed surface occupied by redds (P). Predictions indicate that hyporheic volume and flux systematically increase with P, while the mean hydraulic residence time of dissolved MDN in the hyporheic zone decreases sharply with P, from 5.79 h on an unspawned bed (P = 0) to 0.03 h for a mass-spawned bed (P = 1.0). Shorter residence time results from hyporheic flux increasing faster than hyporheic volume with higher P. Implications for uptake of dissolved MDN are explored with Damkohler numbers, defined as the ratio of the mean hydraulic residence time to a biogeochemical rate of interest. Given the considerable influence of spawning on hyporheic exchange, additional research is needed to determine conditions under which bioassimilation of dissolved MDN is limited by nutrient supply, extent of the hyporheic zone, or processing rate of MDN in stream beds.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000358608600003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bthe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bsalmon%2Bspawning%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bof%2Bmarine-derived%2Bnutrients%2Bin%2Bgravel%2Bstream%2Bbeds%26rft.aufirst%3DTodd%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DTH%26rft.aulast%3DBuxton%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252Fcjfas-2014-0413%26rft.eissn%3D1205-7533%26rft.epage%3D1158%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1146-1158%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1146%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D72%26rft.au%3DBuxton%252C%2BTH%26rft.au%3DBuffington%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DYager%252C%2BEM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Hancock, PJ",Dec 1 2005 ,"The effects of an environmental flow release on water quality in the hyporheic zone of the Hunter River, Australia",HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Environmental flow releases have been advocated as a useful rehabilitation strategy for improving river condition but assessments of their success have typically focused on surface water quality and biota. In this study, we investigated the impacts of an environmental flow release on water temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentrations in surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water at upwelling and downwelling zones in three sites along the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. We hypothesised that the flow pulse would 'flush' the sediments with oxygenated water, stimulating hyporheic microbial activity and nitrification, enhancing nitrate concentrations over time. Surface and subsurface samples were collected before, 7 days after, and 49 days after an environmental flow release of 5000 MI for a period of 3 days. No lasting effects on dissolved oxygen or conductivity were evident at most sites although dissolved oxygen declined over time at the downwelling site at Bowmans Crossing. At the downwelling zones at all sites, hyporheic nitrate concentrations declined initially following the release, but then rose or leveled off by Day 49. This initial drop in concentration was attributed to flushing of nitrate from the sediments. At two sites, nitrate concentrations had increased by Day 49 in the upwelling zones while at the third site, it fell significantly, associated with very low dissolved oxygen and likely reductive loss of nitrate. Electrical conductivity data indicate that potential inputs of agriculturally enriched groundwater may contribute to the nitrogen dynamics of the Hunter River. This study highlights the spatial heterogeneity that occurs in the hyporheic zone within and among sites of a regulated river, and emphasises the need for multiple-site surveys and an understanding of groundwater dynamics to assess physicochemical responses of the hyporheic zone to environmental flow releases.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000233567800007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Ban%2Benvironmental%2Bflow%2Brelease%2Bon%2Bwater%2Bquality%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bthe%2BHunter%2BRiver%252C%2BAustralia%26rft.aufirst%3DPJ%26rft.auinit%3DPJ%26rft.aulast%3DHancock%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-005-1506-5%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D85%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D75-85%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D75%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D552%26rft.au%3DHancock%252C%2BPJ%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0C93Y6tWKOlGvmyJSM9iFpX&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
