0,"Iepure, S",Nov 2022 ,Applying Electrical Resistivity Tomography and Biological Methods to Assess the Hyporheic Zone Water Exchanges in Two Mediterranean Stream Reaches,WATER,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) is a critical area of all river ecosystems. It is the area beneath the stream and adjacent to the stream, where the surface water and groundwater are mixed. The HZ extends both vertically and laterally depending on the sediment configuration, namely their porosity and permeability. This influences the hyporheic communities' structural pattern and their active dispersal among distinct rivers compartments and alluvial aquifers. It is still difficult to assess the spatial extent of the HZ and the distribution of the mixing zones. This study applies time-lapse images obtained using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) of 20 m wide and 5 m deep alluvial streams, with regards to the structural pattern of hyporheic communities represented by cyclopoids and ostracods, in order to assess the extent of the HZ in the riverbed and the parafluvial sediment configurations. The ERT images obtained at the hyporheic Site 1 are characterized by alluvial deposits dominated by coarse and very coarse sands with resistivity values ranging from similar to 20 to 80 Ohm.m, indicating a permeable zone up to similar to 0.5 m thick and extending laterally for ca. 5 m from the channel and associated with the hyporheic zone. The sediment configurations, texture, and structure indicate an active surface-hyporheic water exchange and low water retention into the sediments. This is also indicated by the hyporheic copepods and ostracods communities' structure formed by a mixture of non-stygobites (five species) and stygobites (two species). A low-resistivity (<70 Ohm.m) permeable zone located 2.3 m below the streambed and unconnected with the river channel was also detected and associated with the associated alluvial aquifer. In contrast, the resistivity image at Site 2 dominated by coarse, medium, and very fine sands, shows a low-permeability zone in the upper similar to 0.5 m of the profile, with a resistivity value ranging from similar to 45 to 80 Ohm.m, indicating a reduced HZ extension in both vertical and lateral dimensions. Here the sediment configurations indicate that the water retention and interaction with the sediment is higher, reflected by more diverse hyporheic communities and with highly abundant stygobite species. The two examples show that non-invasive ERT images and biological assessments provide complementary and valuable information about the characterization of the sub-channel architecture and its potential hydraulic connection to the floodplain aquifer.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000881396100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B3396%26rft.atitle%3DApplying%2BElectrical%2BResistivity%2BTomography%2Band%2BBiological%2BMethods%2Bto%2BAssess%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BWater%2BExchanges%2Bin%2BTwo%2BMediterranean%2BStream%2BReaches%26rft.aufirst%3DSanda%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DIepure%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw14213396%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D21%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DIepure%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DGomez-Ortiz%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DDi%2BLorenzo%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Boulton, AJ",Apr 2007 ,Hyporheic rehabilitation in rivers: restoring vertical connectivity,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. The hyporheic zone below the channel and banks of many rivers where surface water and ground water exchanges plays a crucial functional role in the biogeochemical transformation of water, mediated by active microbial biofilms. This zone also harbours assemblages of invertebrates that graze biofilms, contribute to secondary production, and can alter the porosity of the hyporheic zone through their movement or burrowing activities.2. Many human activities cause interstitial sedimentation or disrupt surface-groundwater hydrological linkages, impacting upon ecological processes in the hyporheic zone. However, strategies for river rehabilitation seldom explicitly consider the hyporheic zone or seek to restore lost vertical linkages with groundwater. Instead, restoration goals target surface, riparian or floodplain features even though current river ecosystem theory emphasises the three dimensions of hydrological connectivity. To guide effective, holistic river restoration, scientists and managers therefore need information on the mechanisms by which energy and material are transferred in the hyporheic zone and which ecosystem services are thus provided.3. Other gaps in our understanding of hyporheic zone rehabilitation include recruitment processes of the hyporheos and the relative importance of groups of hyporheic invertebrates in rivers differing in substratum size, disturbance frequency and groundwater linkages. Carefully designed experiments that assess responses to hyporheic rehabilitation strategies will provide valuable data at varying scales (e.g. distribution of hyporheic habitat types at the reach scale) for management as well as providing insights into the mechanisms controlling hyporheic invertebrate assemblages and ecological processes. Fully successful river rehabilitation must include restoration of vertical linkages between the river and its shallow groundwater aquifers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000245280600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Brehabilitation%2Bin%2Brivers%253A%2Brestoring%2Bvertical%2Bconnectivity%26rft.aufirst%3DAndrew%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2006.01710.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D650%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D632-650%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D632%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D52&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
2,"Poole, GC",Jan 14 2022 ,"Hyporheic hydraulic geometry: Conceptualizing relationships among hyporheic exchange, storage, and water age",PLOS ONE,"Hyporheic exchange is now widely acknowledged as a key driver of ecosystem processes in many streams. Yet stream ecologists have been slow to adopt nuanced hydrologic frameworks developed and applied by engineers and hydrologists to describe the relationship between water storage, water age, and water balance in finite hydrosystems such as hyporheic zones. Here, in the context of hyporheic hydrology, we summarize a well-established mathematical framework useful for describing hyporheic hydrology, while also applying the framework heuristically to visualize the relationships between water age, rates of hyporheic exchange, and water volume within hyporheic zones. Building on this heuristic application, we discuss how improved accuracy in the conceptualization of hyporheic exchange can yield a deeper understanding of the role of the hyporheic zone in stream ecosystems. Although the equations presented here have been well-described for decades, our aim is to make the mathematical basis as accessible as possible and to encourage broader understanding among aquatic ecologists of the implications of tailed age distributions commonly observed in water discharged from and stored within hyporheic zones. Our quantitative description of ""hyporheic hydraulic geometry,"" associated visualizations, and discussion offer a nuanced and realistic understanding of hyporheic hydrology to aid in considering hyporheic exchange in the context of river and stream ecosystem science and management.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000812798500028,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be0262080%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bhydraulic%2Bgeometry%253A%2BConceptualizing%2Brelationships%2Bamong%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%252C%2Bstorage%252C%2Band%2Bwater%2Bage%26rft.aufirst%3DGeoffrey%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DGC%26rft.aulast%3DPoole%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1371%252Fjournal.pone.0262080%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1932-6203%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DPLOS%2BONE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DPLOS%2BONE%26rft.volume%3D17%26rft.au%3DPoole%252C%2BGC%26rft.au%3DFogg%252C%2BSK%26rft.au%3DOakland%252C%2BHC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=PLOS+ONE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We illustrate this relationship using two case studies from very different lotic ecosystems: a large mesic river in France and an intermittent desert stream in Arizona. In both cases, there are strong correlations between direction and magnitude of hydrologic fluxes and the composition of hyporheic invertebrate assemblages. Hydrologists are likely to find that the distribution and abundance of hyporheos will provide useful corroborative data in studies of hyporheic flow dynamics, while ecologists should recognize the effects of hydrologic exchange between the surface stream and the hyporheic zone at a variety of scales. Thus hydrologic measurements of surface water and ground-water exchange should be included routinely in future studies of hyporheic invertebrate ecology. Such exchange controls the availability of nutrients, food, and dissolved gases to the hyporheos and indicates a mechanism whereby the subsurface component influences processes occurring in the rest of the lotic ecosystem.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1993KR24300010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BTHE%2BDISTRIBUTION%2BOF%2BHYPORHEOS%2B-%2BPERSPECTIVES%2BFROM%2BA%2BMESIC%2BRIVER%2BAND%2BA%2BDESERT%2BSTREAM%26rft.aufirst%3DEH%26rft.auinit%3DEH%26rft.aulast%3DSTANLEY%26rft.date%3D1993%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1467688%26rft.epage%3D83%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D79-83%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D79%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DSTANLEY%252C%2BEH%26rft.au%3DBOULTON%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"LeFebvre, S",Sep 2004 ,Stream regulation and nitrogen dynamics in sediment interstices: Comparison of natural and straightened sectors of a third-order stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Nitrogen dynamics were studied in the interstitial environment (i.e. hyporheic zone) of a sandy-bottom stream in a rural landscape. A third-order stream in Brittany (France) was studied at 11 stations (riffles) to evaluate spatial patterns of water exchange between surface and interstitial habitats. More intensive sampling was conducted in three riffles selected according to their hydrological characteristics. Chemical characteristics (especially nitrogen) and microbial denitrification were studied at 12.5 and 25 cm depth upstream, and 25 cm depth downstream of each riffle. This study confirms that the interstitial habitat of a N-rich stream acts as a sink for the nitrate-nitrogen. Experimental manipulation of sediment cores indicates that denitrification is limited by carbon in surface (i.e. benthic) and by nitrate in hyporheic sediments. River regulation increases inputs of fine sediments, modifies river channel location, and generates changes in the spatial patterns of biogeochemical processes, water origins, and hydrologic exchanges.

Accurately capturing the influence of small-scale features associated with turbulent dispersion on exchange in an upscaled framework is necessary for developing reliable predictive models at the reach scale. In this work, we use high-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) to fully resolve turbulent flow and hyporheic exchange in an open channel. We parameterize a 2D particle tracking model with the average DNS velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles. Breakthrough curves and rate of surface mass loss to the subsurface in both models agree after a sufficient distance downstream from particle injection. Finally we find that the travel time/distance joint pdf contains enough information to parameterize a 1D dual domain coupled Continuous Time Random Walk (ddc-CTRW) model that successfully reproduces the behavior of both the DNS and the 2D particle tracking model, allowing accurate prediction of breakthrough curves. Predicting breakthrough curves with a fully parameterized ddc-CTRW reduces cpu time by orders of magnitude when compared with DNS.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000458695600005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BDual%2BDomain%2Bstochastic%2Blagrangian%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Bpredicting%2Btransport%2Bin%2Bopen%2Bchannels%2Bwith%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DThomas%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DSherman%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2019.01.007%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.epage%3D67%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D57-67%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D57%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D125%26rft.au%3DSherman%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DRoche%252C%2BKR%26rft.au%3DBolster%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
7,"Song, JX",Sep 15 2017 ,Variability in the vertical hyporheic water exchange affected by hydraulic conductivity and river morphology at a natural confluent meander bend,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"River confluences and their associated tributaries are key morphodynamic nodes that play important roles in controlling hydraulic geometry and hyporheic water exchange in fluvial networks. However, the existing knowledge regarding hyporheic water exchange associated with river confluence morphology is relatively scarce. On January 14 and 15, 2016, the general hydraulic and morphological characteristics of the confluent meander bend (CMB) between the Juehe River and the Haohe River in the southern region of Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China, were investigated. The patterns and magnitudes of vertical hyporheic water exchange (VHWE) were estimated based on a one-dimensional heat steady-state model, whereas the sediment vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) was calculated via in situ permeameter tests. The results demonstrated that 6 hydrodynamic zones and their extensions were observed at the CMB during the test period. These zones were likely controlled by the obtuse junction angle and low momentum flux ratio, influencing the sediment grain size distribution of the CMB. The VHWE patterns at the test site during the test period mostly showed upwelling flow dominated by regional groundwater discharging into the river. The occurrence of longitudinal downwelling and upwelling patterns along the meander bend at the CMB was likely subjected to the comprehensive influences of the local sinuosity of the meander bend and regional groundwater discharge and finally formed regional and local flow paths. Additionally, in dominated upwelling areas, the change in VHWE magnitudes was nearly consistent with that in K-v values, and higher values of both variables generally occurred in erosional zones near the thalweg paths of the CMB, which were mostly made up of sand and gravel. This was potentially caused by the erosional and depositional processes subjected to confluence morphology. Furthermore, lower K-v values observed in downwelling areas at the CMB were attributed to sediment clogging caused by local downwelling flow. The confluence morphology and sediment K-v are thus likely the driving factors that cause local variations in the VHWE of fluvial systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000408341800008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariability%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bvertical%2Bhyporheic%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Baffected%2Bby%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Band%2Briver%2Bmorphology%2Bat%2Ba%2Bnatural%2Bconfluent%2Bmeander%2Bbend%26rft.aufirst%3DJinxi%26rft.auinit%3DJX%26rft.aulast%3DSong%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.11265%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D3420%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D19%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3407-3420%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3407%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BGT%26rft.au%3DDou%252C%2BXY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
8,"Lv, JZ",Nov 2022 ,Numerical simulation of hyporheic exchange driven by an emergent vegetation patch,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Vegetation patches increase the pressure gradient of local channels and can create an uneven pressure distribution at the water-sediment interface, thereby driving hyporheic exchange. However, this process has rarely been discussed. We investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of hyporheic exchange under the influence of multiple factors. A bidirectional coupling model of the overlying water and sediment with an emergent vegetation patch was adopted. The results show that hyporheic exchange driven by vegetation patches are spatially heterogeneous. The active area of hyporheic exchange was concentrated directly below the vegetation patch. A finger flow was formed at the edge of the active hyporheic exchange zone as the exchange took place. Furthermore, intermittent downward solute transport path (IDSTP) was formed downstream of the vegetation patch, and the exchange rate was one order of magnitude smaller than that of the hyporheic exchange active zone. Hyporheic exchange occurred at the stem and patch scales when the vegetation density was relatively high. There was a logarithmic relationship between the hyporheic exchange flux and sediment permeability, and a power function relationship existed between the hyporheic exchange flux and Reynolds number. The active area of hyporheic exchange will help predict pollutant transport and understand vegetation's nutrient absorption process.

9,"Long, SL",Mar 30 2014 ,Variation of stream temperature among mesoscale habitats within stream reaches: southern Appalachians,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream mesoscale habitats have systematic topographic relationships to hyporheic flow patterns, which may create predictable temperature variation between mesoscale habitat types. We investigated whether systematic differences in temperature metrics occurred between mesoscale habitats within reaches of small streams tributary to the upper Little Tennessee River, southern Appalachians. Surface water temperature was recorded over three or four mid-summer days in four mesoscale habitat types: riffle, main riffle, pool and alcove in 44 stream segments (sites). Temperature metrics were calculated for each mesoscale habitat relative to the mean value of the metric over the stream: maximum temperature, average maximum temperature and maximum daily variation and also for each site: standard deviation of the maximum temperature and average diurnal variation (ADV). Sites were categorized as fully or partially forested. Pool tailouts had statistically significantly lower maximum temperature and average maximum temperature than riffle tailouts in partially forested sites, although differences were small. This was the opposite of what was expected in the presence of hyporheic exchange, indicating hyporheic exchange is not a dominant driver of mesoscale habitat temperatures at these sites. Temperature differences between mesoscale habitat units were small and unlikely to have ecological significance. We also evaluated relationships between stream temperature and riparian condition, watershed % impervious surfaces, watershed % non-forested and elevation. ADV and standard deviation of the maximum temperature were significantly higher in partially forested sites, indicating that partially forested sites have greater temperature ranges and spatial variation of maximum temperatures. ADV decreased with elevation and increased with % impervious surfaces.

10,"Krause, S",Mar 2022 ,Organizational Principles of Hyporheic Exchange Flow and Biogeochemical Cycling in River Networks Across Scales,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic zones increase freshwater ecosystem resilience to hydrological extremes and global environmental change. However, current conceptualizations of hyporheic exchange, residence time distributions, and the associated biogeochemical cycling in streambed sediments do not always accurately explain the hydrological and biogeochemical complexity observed in streams and rivers. Specifically, existing conceptual models insufficiently represent the coupled transport and reactivity along groundwater and surface water flow paths, the role of autochthonous organic matter in streambed biogeochemical functioning, and the feedbacks between surface-subsurface ecological processes, both within and across spatial and temporal scales. While simplified approaches to these issues are justifiable and necessary for transferability, the exclusion of important hyporheic processes from our conceptualizations can lead to erroneous conclusions and inadequate understanding and management of interconnected surface water and groundwater environments. This is particularly true at the landscape scale, where the organizational principles of spatio-temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) and biogeochemical processes remain largely uncharacterized. This article seeks to identify the most important drivers and controls of HEF and biogeochemical cycling based on a comprehensive synthesis of findings from a wide range of river systems. We use these observations to test current paradigms and conceptual models, discussing the interactions of local-to-regional hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological controls of hyporheic zone functioning. This improved conceptualization of the landscape organizational principles of drivers of HEF and biogeochemical processes from reach to catchment scales will inform future river research directions and watershed management strategies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000834099100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOrganizational%2BPrinciples%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BFlow%2Band%2BBiogeochemical%2BCycling%2Bin%2BRiver%2BNetworks%2BAcross%2BScales%26rft.aufirst%3DStefan%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DKrause%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR029771%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DKrause%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DAbbott%252C%2BBW%26rft.au%3DZarnetzke%252C%2BJP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
11,"Rana, SMM",May 2017 ,Effects of in-stream structures and channel flow rate variation on transient storage,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"In-stream structures can potentially enhance surface and subsurface solute retention. They form naturally in small streams and their installation has gained popularity in stream restoration for multiple purposes, including improved water quality. Yet few studies have quantified the cumulative effect of multiple structures on solute transport at the reach scale, nor how this varies with changing stream flow. We built a series of weirs in a small stream to simulate channel spanning structures such as natural debris dams and stream restoration log dams and boulder weirs. We conducted constant rate conservative (NaCl) tracer injections to quantify the effect of the weirs on solute transport at the reach scale. We used a one dimensional solute transport model with transient storage to quantify the change of solute transport parameters with increasing number of weirs. Results indicate that adding weirs significantly increased the cross-sectional area of the surface stream (A) and transient storage zones (A(s)) while exchange with transient storage (cc) decreased. The increase in A and As is due to backwater behind weirs and increased hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange induced by the weirs, while we surmise that the reduction in alpha is due at least in part to reduced hydrodynamically driven hyporheic exchange in bed ripples drowned by the weir backwater. In order for weir installation to achieve net improvement in solute retention and thus water quality, cumulative reactions in weir backwater and enhanced hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange would have to overcome the reduced hydrodynamically driven exchange. Analysis of channel flow variation over the course of the experiments indicated that weirs change the relationship between transient storage parameters and flow, for example the trend of increasing a with flow without weirs was reversed in the presence of weirs. Effects of flow variation were substantial, indicating that transient storage measurements at a single point in time typically cannot be extrapolated to estimate net annual effects. Thus, rigorous evaluation of water quality effects of stream restoration structures requires measurements at multiple channel flow rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

12,"TRISKA, FJ",Feb 5 1993 ,THE ROLE OF WATER EXCHANGE BETWEEN A STREAM CHANNEL AND ITS HYPORHEIC ZONE IN NITROGEN CYCLING AT THE TERRESTRIAL AQUATIC INTERFACE,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The subsurface riparian zone was examined as an ecotone with two interfaces. Inland is a terrestrial boundary, where transport of water and dissolved solutes is toward the channel and controlled by watershed hydrology. Streamside is an aquatic boundary, where exchange of surface water and dissolved solutes is bi-directional and flux is strongly influenced by channel hydraulics. Streamside, bi-directional exchange of water was qualitatively defined using biologically conservative tracers in a third order stream. In several experiments, penetration of surface water extended 18 m inland. Travel time of water from the channel to bankside sediments was highly variable. Subsurface chemical gradients were indirectly related to the travel time. Sites with long travel times tended to be low in nitrate and DO (dissolved oxygen) but high in ammonium and DOC (dissolved organic carbon). Sites with short travel times tended to be high in nitrate and DO but low in ammonium and DOC. Ammonium concentration of interstitial water also was influenced by sorption-desorption processes that involved clay minerals in hyporheic sediments. Denitrification potential in subsurface sediments increased with distance from the channel, and was limited by nitrate at inland sites and by DO in the channel sediments. Conversely, nitrification potential decreased with distance from the channel, and was limited by DO at inland sites and by ammonium at channel locations. Advection of water and dissolved oxygen away from the channel resulted in an oxidized subsurface habitat equivalent to that previously defined as the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone is viewed as stream habitat because of its high proportion of surface water and the occurrence of channel organisms. Beyond the channel's hydrologic exchange zone, interstitial water is often chemically reduced. Interstitial water that has not previously entered the channel, groundwater, is viewed as a terrestrial component of the riparian ecotone. Thus, surface water habitats may extend under riparian vegetation, and terrestrial groundwater habitats may be found beneath the stream channel.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1993KX96900022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTHE%2BROLE%2BOF%2BWATER%2BEXCHANGE%2BBETWEEN%2BA%2BSTREAM%2BCHANNEL%2BAND%2BITS%2BHYPORHEIC%2BZONE%2BIN%2BNITROGEN%2BCYCLING%2BAT%2BTHE%2BTERRESTRIAL%2BAQUATIC%2BINTERFACE%26rft.aufirst%3DFJ%26rft.auinit%3DFJ%26rft.aulast%3DTRISKA%26rft.date%3D1993%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00007177%26rft.epage%3D184%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1-3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D167-184%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D167%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D251%26rft.au%3DTRISKA%252C%2BFJ%26rft.au%3DDUFF%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DAVANZINO%252C%2BRJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
13,"Stubbington, R",Nov 2011 ,Spatial variability in the hyporheic zone refugium of temporary streams,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"A key ecological role hypothesized for the hyporheic zone is as a refugium that promotes survival of benthic invertebrates during adverse conditions in the surface stream. Many studies have investigated use of the hyporheic refugium during hydrological extremes (spates and streambed drying), and recent research has linked an increase in the abundance of benthic invertebrates within hyporheic sediments to increasing biotic interactions during flow recession in a temporary stream. This study examined spatial variability in the refugial capacity of the hyporheic zone in two groundwater-dominated streams in which flow permanence varied over small areas. Two non-insect taxa, Commands pulex and Polycelis spp. were common to both streams and were investigated in detail. Hydrological conditions in both streams comprised a four-month period of flow recession and low flows, accompanied by reductions in water depth and wetted width. Consequent declines in submerged benthic habitat availability were associated with increases in population densities of mobile benthic taxa, in particular G. pulex. The reduction in the spatial extent of the hyporheic zone was minimal, and this habitat was therefore a potential refugium from increasing biotic interactions in the benthic sediments. Concurrent increases in the hyporheic abundance and hyporheic proportion of a taxon's total (benthic + hyporheic) population were considered as evidence of active refugium use. Such evidence was species-specific and site-specific, with refugium use being observed only for G. pulex and at sites dominated by downwelling water. A conceptual model of spatial variability in the refugial capacity of the hyporheic zone during habitat contraction is presented, which highlights the potential importance of the direction of hydrologic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000296533400005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Bvariability%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Brefugium%2Bof%2Btemporary%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DRachel%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DStubbington%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-011-0203-x%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.epage%3D511%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D499-511%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D499%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D73%26rft.au%3DStubbington%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DWood%252C%2BPJ%26rft.au%3DReid%252C%2BI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
14,"DiStefano, RJ",Mar 2009 ,Imperiled crayfishes use hyporheic zone during seasonal drying of an intermittent stream,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"Despite the prevalence and importance of intermittent streams, few studies have examined their use by crayfishes. We documented persistence in an intermittent stream and use of the hyporheic zone by 2 imperiled crayfishes, Orconectes williamsi and Orconectes meeki meeki, upon stream drying. During 2005 to 2007, we monitored summer flows and crayfish densities in 10 riffles in a Missouri (US) Ozark stream to document stream drying and crayfish persistence. Stream drying variables were riffle wetted area (m(2)) and current velocity (m/s). Crayfish density estimates were obtained with a quadrat sampler. We sampled monthly (May-August 2006) to examine crayfish response to decreased flows, and excavated dry quadrat samples (to 30 cm depth) after surface flows ceased. Over 2 periods during summer 2007, we used baited traps in the stream and a downstream reservoir where the stream terminates to examine whether crayfish migrated from the stream to permanent water in response to drying. Riffles dried significantly by July, few had surface water present by August, and all were rewetted by the following June. Annual June densities of O. williamsi remained stable throughout the study, whereas densities of O. m. meeki were lower in 2007 than 2005. Both species burrowed to the hyporheic zone during drying, and crayfish densities were similar to those estimated in riffles before drying. We found no evidence that either species migrated to permanent water in the reservoir during drying. Use by crayfish of the hyporheic zone during drying and interannual persistence in intermittent streams suggests that hyporheic habitats are important for conservation of these crayfishes. Our study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge that indicates the importance of intermittent streams for conservation of freshwater biodiversity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000263481300013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImperiled%2Bcrayfishes%2Buse%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bduring%2Bseasonal%2Bdrying%2Bof%2Ban%2Bintermittent%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DRJ%26rft.aulast%3DDiStefano%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F08-072.1%26rft.epage%3D152%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D142-152%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D142%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DDiStefano%252C%2BRJ%26rft.au%3DMagoulick%252C%2BDD%26rft.au%3DLarson%252C%2BER&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

16,"Sawyer, AH",Aug 3 2011 ,Hyporheic exchange due to channel-spanning logs,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The flow of river water around large woody debris (LWD) creates pressure gradients along the riverbed that drive a large zone of river-groundwater mixing, or hyporheic exchange. Flume experiments and numerical simulations show that river water downwells into the riverbed upstream of a channel-spanning log and upwells downstream. Exchange rates are greatest near the log and decay exponentially with distance upstream and downstream. We developed equations for bed pressure profiles and hyporheic exchange rates in the vicinity of a channel-spanning log that can be used to evaluate the impact of LWD removal or reintroduction on hyporheic mixing. The magnitude of pressure disturbance along the bed (and thus hyporheic exchange) increases with the fraction of channel depth blocked by the log and channel Froude number. Exchange rates are relatively insensitive to relative depth of the log (gap ratio). At natural densities, LWD in lowland streams drives reach-averaged hyporheic exchange rates similar to a ripple-covered bed. However, the length scales and residence times of hyporheic exchange due to LWD are greater. By removing LWD from streams, humans have altered patterns and rates of hyporheic exchange, which influence habitat distribution and quality for invertebrates and fish.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000293649700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08502%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bdue%2Bto%2Bchannel-spanning%2Blogs%26rft.aufirst%3DAudrey%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DAH%26rft.aulast%3DSawyer%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR010484%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DButtles%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"Gooseff, MN",Oct 15 2005 ,"A modelling study of hyporheic exchange pattern and the sequence, size, and spacing of stream bedforms in mountain stream networks, Oregon, USA (Retracted article. See vol 20, pg 2441, 2006)",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Studies of hyporheic exchange flows have identified physical features of channels that control exchange flow at the channel unit scale, namely slope breaks in the longitudinal profile of streams that generate subsurface head distributions. We recently completed a field study that suggested channel unit spacing in stream longitudinal profiles can be used to predict the spacing between zones of upwelling (flux of hyporheic water into the stream) and downwelling (flux of stream water into the hyporheic zone) in the beds of mountain streams. Here, we use two-dimensional groundwater flow and particle tracking models to simulate vertical and longitudinal hyporheic exchange along the longitudinal axis of stream flow in second-, third-, and fourth-order mountain stream reaches. Modelling allowed us to (1) represent visually the effect that the shape of the longitudinal profile has on the flow net beneath streambeds; (2) isolate channel unit sequence and spacing as individual factors controlling the depth that stream water penetrates the hyporheic zone and the length of upwelling and downwelling zones; (3) evaluate the degree to which the effects of regular patterns in bedform size and sequence are masked by irregularities in real streams. We simulated hyporheic exchange in two sets of idealized stream reaches and one set of observed stream reaches. Idealized profiles were constructed using regression equations relating channel form to basin area. The size and length of channel units (step size, pool length, etc.) increased with increasing stream order. Simulations of hyporheic exchange flows in these reaches suggested that upwelling lengths increased (from 2.7 m to 7.6 m), and downwelling lengths increased (from 2.9 m to 6(.)0 m) with increase in stream order from second to fourth order. Step spacing in the idealized reaches increased from 5.3 m to 13.7 m as stream size increased from second to fourth order. Simulated upwelling lengths increased from 4.3 m in second-order streams to 9.7 m in fourth-order streams with a POOL-RIFFLE-STEP channel unit sequence, and increased from 2.5 m to 6(.)1 m from second- to fourth-order streams with a POOL-STEP-RIFFLE channel unit sequence. Downwelling lengths also increased with stream order in these idealized channels. Our results suggest that channel unit spacing, size, and sequence are all important in determining hyporheic exchange patterns of upwelling and downwelling. Though irregularities in the size and spacing of bedforms caused flow nets to be much more complex in surveyed stream reaches than in idealized stream reaches, similar trends emerged relating the average geomorphic wavelength to the average hyporheic wavelength in both surveyed and idealized reaches.

18,"Harvey, J",Sep 2015 ,River corridor science: Hydrologic exchange and ecological consequences from bedforms to basins,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Previously regarded as the passive drains of watersheds, over the past 50 years, rivers have progressively been recognized as being actively connected with off-channel environments. These connections prolong physical storage and enhance reactive processing to alter water chemistry and downstream transport of materials and energy. Here we propose river corridor science as a concept that integrates downstream transport with lateral and vertical exchange across interfaces. Thus, the river corridor, rather than the wetted river channel itself, is an increasingly common unit of study. Main channel exchange with recirculating marginal waters, hyporheic exchange, bank storage, and overbank flow onto floodplains are all included under a broad continuum of interactions known as hydrologic exchange flows. Hydrologists, geomorphologists, geochemists, and aquatic and terrestrial ecologists are cooperating in studies that reveal the dynamic interactions among hydrologic exchange flows and consequences for water quality improvement, modulation of river metabolism, habitat provision for vegetation, fish, and wildlife, and other valued ecosystem services. The need for better integration of science and management is keenly felt, from testing effectiveness of stream restoration and riparian buffers all the way to reevaluating the definition of the waters of the United States to clarify the regulatory authority under the Clean Water Act. A major challenge for scientists is linking the small-scale physical drivers with their larger-scale fluvial and geomorphic context and ecological consequences. Although the fine scales of field and laboratory studies are best suited to identifying the fundamental physical and biological processes, that understanding must be successfully linked to cumulative effects at watershed to regional and continental scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000363391300004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRiver%2Bcorridor%2Bscience%253A%2BHydrologic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Becological%2Bconsequences%2Bfrom%2Bbedforms%2Bto%2Bbasins%26rft.aufirst%3DJud%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DHarvey%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015WR017617%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6922%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6893-6922%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6893%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DGooseff%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Kasahara, T",Oct 2007 ,"Lateral hyporheic zone chemistry in an artificially constructed gravel bar and a re-meandered stream channel, southern Ontario, Canada",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"The effect of stream restoration on hyporheic functions has been neglected, although channel rehabilitation projects have a potential to alter stream- ground- water interactions. The present study examined the effect of an artificially constructed gravel bar and re- meandered stream channel on lateral hyporheic exchange flow and chemistry in two lowland N- rich streams in southern Ontario, Canada. Nitrate concentrations were relatively high, ranging from 0.5 to 1.3 mg N/ l in both streams during spring through fall months. However, nitrate concentrations showed a steep decline as stream water entered the gravel bar and the meander bends. Differences between observed and predicted nitrate concentrations based on conservative ion concentration patterns indicated that 40- 100 and 68- 98% of the nitrate entering the hyporheic zone was removed in the gravel bar and meanders, respectively. Rapid depletion of dissolved oxygen concentrations along lateral hyporheic flow paths and denitrifying potentials assayed by the acetylene block technique in hyporheic sediments suggests that denitrification was an important mechanism of nitrate depletion. Despite the high rate of nitrate removal, the flux of stream water laterally entering the constructed gravel bar and meander bends was very small, and hyporheic nitrate removal was < 0.015% of the daily stream load during base- flow periods in summer and fall. The effects of restoration projects on hyporheic zone dynamics are often limited in lowland streams by low channel gradients and fine floodplain sediments with low interstitial flows that restrict the magnitude of the stream-hyporheic connection.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000249488500015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLateral%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bchemistry%2Bin%2Ban%2Bartificially%2Bconstructed%2Bgravel%2Bbar%2Band%2Ba%2Bre-meandered%2Bstream%2Bchannel%252C%2Bsouthern%2BOntario%252C%2BCanada%26rft.aufirst%3DTamao%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DKasahara%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1752-1688.2007.00108.x%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D1269%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1257-1269%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1257%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DKasahara%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DHill%252C%2BAR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Sawyer, AH",Oct 23 2012 ,Effect of experimental wood addition on hyporheic exchange and thermal dynamics in a losing meadow stream,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream restoration structures such as large wood can enhance shallow river-groundwater exchange, or hyporheic exchange, and alter temperature dynamics in restored reaches. We added and then removed channel-spanning logs in a second-order mountain meadow stream to test short-term impacts on hyporheic exchange, streambed temperatures, and surface water temperatures. Based on vertical seepage measurements and numerical simulations of hyporheic fluid and heat flow, large wood addition increased hyporheic exchange and altered streambed temperatures. In this losing stream, meter-scale hyporheic exchange cells formed beneath large wood. Upwelling pore water downstream of logs stabilized diel temperature cycles across <8% of the streambed, creating localized but potentially valuable thermal refuge. Exchange rates were <0.1% of channel discharge-too small to impact the range of diel temperature signals in surface water. However, the lag between downstream and upstream diel temperature signals was slightly greater with large wood, which may indicate that surface storage zones rather than hyporheic storage zones increased thermal retardation. Losing conditions limited the spatial extent and rates of hyporheic exchange near large wood. Impacts of large wood reintroduction on hyporheic exchange depend on ambient groundwater discharge or recharge, streambed permeability, channel Froude number, large wood blockage ratio, and large wood spacing. In many streams, large wood reintroduction may increase hyporheic habitat volume and complexity but may not increase exchange rates enough to alter surface water temperature or chemistry. Surface storage zones such as eddies and pools can still influence heat and solute retention in the channel.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000310346100002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW10537%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Bexperimental%2Bwood%2Baddition%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bthermal%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Ba%2Blosing%2Bmeadow%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DAudrey%2BH.%26rft.auinit%3DAH%26rft.aulast%3DSawyer%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011776%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
21,"Hester, ET",Jun 2019 ,Effect of Surface Water Stage Fluctuation on Mixing-Dependent Hyporheic Denitrification in Riverbed Dunes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The hyporheic zone, where surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) interact in shallow sediments beneath rivers, is uniquely reactive and attenuates pollutants. Mixing of reactants from SW and GW enables mixing-dependent (MD) reactions, which may be the last opportunity for GW contaminants to react before entering SW. Yet little is known about hyporheic MD reactions, particularly how they respond to daily or seasonal SW fluctuations or sediment heterogeneity. We used MODFLOW and SEAM3D to simulate non-mixing-dependent (NMD) aerobic respiration and MD denitrification in a riverbed dune with nitrate from SW and dissolved organic carbon from GW. We varied SW heads and heterogeneity of sediment hydraulic conductivity. For longer-term fluctuations (i.e., seasons), increasing SW depth from 0.1 to 1.0 m increased NMD aerobic respiration by 270% and MD denitrification by 78% in homogeneous sediment. MD reactions thus were controlled by mixing zone length or size and would be stronger when SW stage is elevated, for example, during wintertime. Adding sediment heterogeneity to the long-term scenarios, particularly by increasing hydraulic conductivity correlation length, increased flow focusing and consequently increased MD denitrification by 20-30%. By contrast, the net effect of daily SW fluctuations on MD denitrification in homogeneous sediment was minor. In sum, SW fluctuations are an important control on hyporheic MD reactions, primarily by controlling mixing zone length. The hyporheic zone may attenuate nitrate in upwelling GW plumes, but temporal fluctuations may be considerable as quantified above.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000477616900010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2BSurface%2BWater%2BStage%2BFluctuation%2Bon%2BMixing-Dependent%2BHyporheic%2BDenitrification%2Bin%2BRiverbed%2BDunes%26rft.aufirst%3DErich%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DET%26rft.aulast%3DHester%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR024198%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4687%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4668-4687%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4668%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET%26rft.au%3DEastes%252C%2BLA%26rft.au%3DWiddowson%252C%2BMA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Pacioglu, O",Mar 2016 ,Response of invertebrates from the hyporheic zone of chalk rivers to eutrophication and land use,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Whereas the response of lotic benthic macroinvertebrates to different environmental stressors is a widespread practice nowadays in assessing the water and habitat quality, the use of hyporheic zone invertebrates is still in its infancy. In this study, classification and regression trees analysis were employed in order to assess the ecological requirements and the potential as bioindicators for the hyporheic zone invertebrates inhabiting four lowland chalk rivers (south England) with contrasting eutrophication levels (based on surface nitrate concentrations) and magnitude of land use (based on percentage of fine sediments load and median interstitial space). Samples of fauna, water and sediment were sampled twice, during low (summer) and high (winter) groundwater level, at depths of 20 and 35 cm. Certain groups of invertebrates (Glossosomatidae and Psychomyiidae caddisflies, and riffle beetles) proved to be good indicators of rural catchments, moderately eutrophic and with high fine sediment load. A diverse community dominated by microcrustaceans (cope-pods and ostracods) were found as good indicators of highly eutrophic urban streams, with moderate-high fine sediment load. However, the use of other taxonomic groups (e.g. chironomids, oligochaetes, nematodes, water mites and the amphipod Gammarus pulex), very widespread in the hyporheic zone of all sampled rivers, is of limited use because of their high tolerance to the analysed stressors. We recommend the use of certain taxonomic groups (comprising both meiofauna and macroinvertebrates) dwelling in the chalk hyporheic zone as indicators of eutrophication and colmation and, along with routine benthic sampling protocols, for a more comprehensive water and habitat quality assessment of chalk rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000371156100072,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DResponse%2Bof%2Binvertebrates%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bchalk%2Brivers%2Bto%2Beutrophication%2Band%2Bland%2Buse%26rft.aufirst%3DOctavian%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DPacioglu%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-015-5703-0%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D4740%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4729-4740%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4729%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DPacioglu%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DMoldovan%252C%2BOT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
23,"Martone, I",Mar 2020 ,"Characterization of Hyporheic Exchange Drivers and Patterns within a Low-Gradient, First-Order, River Confluence during Low and High Flow",WATER,"Confluences are nodes in riverine networks characterized by complex three-dimensional changes in flow hydrodynamics and riverbed morphology, and are valued for important ecological functions. This physical complexity is often investigated within the water column or riverbed, while few studies have focused on hyporheic fluxes, which is the mixing of surface water and groundwater across the riverbed. This study aims to understand how hyporheic flux across the riverbed is organized by confluence physical drivers. Field investigations were carried out at a low gradient, headwater confluence between Baltimore Brook and Cold Brook in Marcellus, New York, USA. The study measured channel bathymetry, hydraulic permeability, and vertical temperature profiles, as indicators of the hyporheic exchange due to temperature gradients. Confluence geometry, hydrodynamics, and morphodynamics were found to significantly affect hyporheic exchange rate and patterns. Local scale bed morphology, such as the confluence scour hole and minor topographic irregularities, influenced the distribution of bed pressure head and the related patterns of downwelling/upwelling. Furthermore, classical back-to-back bend planform and the related secondary circulation probably affected hyporheic exchange patterns around the confluence shear layer. Finally, even variations in the hydrological conditions played a role on hyporheic fluxes modifying confluence planform, and, in turn, flow circulation patterns.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000529249500034,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B649%26rft.atitle%3DCharacterization%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%2BDrivers%2Band%2BPatterns%2Bwithin%2Ba%2BLow-Gradient%252C%2BFirst-Order%252C%2BRiver%2BConfluence%2Bduring%2BLow%2Band%2BHigh%2BFlow%26rft.aufirst%3DIvo%26rft.auinit%3DI%26rft.aulast%3DMartone%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12030649%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DMartone%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DGualtieri%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
24,"Hinkle, SR",Apr 20 2001 ,"Linking hyporheic flow and nitrogen cycling near the Willamette River - a large river in Oregon, USA",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Several approaches were used to characterize ground water/surface water interactions near the Willamette River - a large (ninth order) river in Oregon, USA. 4 series of potentiometric surface maps demonstrated the presence of highly dynamic hydraulic gradients between rivers and the adjacent aquifer. Hyporheic zone gradients extended on the order of hundreds of meters. River gains and losses at the river stretch scale (tens of kilometers) were consistent with fluxes implied by the potentiometric surface maps, and apparently reflect regional ground water/surface water interactions. Gains and losses of up to 5-10% of streamflow were observed at this scale. On the river reach scale (1-2 km), gains and losses on the order of 5% of streamflow were interpreted as representing primarily local hyporheic exchange.Isotopic and chemical data collected from shallow hyporheic zone wells demonstrated interaction between regional ground water and river water. The origin of sampled hyporheic zone water ranged from a mixture dominated by regional ground water to water containing 100% river water. The common assumption that ground and river water mix primarily in the river channel is not applicable in this system. Isotopic and chemical data also indicated that significant (nearly complete) vegetative nitrate uptake and/or nitrate reduction occurred in water from 4 of 12 hyporheic zone sites. Ln these cases, it was primarily nitrate transported to the hyporheic zone in regional ground water that was removed from solution. Isotopes of water and nitrate indicated that hyporheic zone water sampled at two sites was composed of water originating as river water and demonstrated that significant vegetative nitrate uptake and nitrate reduction occurred along these hyporheic zone flowpaths. Thus, the hyporheic zone may, in some instances, serve to remove nitrate from river water. Additional investigations with chemical tools and microbial enzyme assays were conducted at one hyporheic site. A strong vertical redox gradient was observed, with nitrate-limited denitrification potential in deeper sediment and both nitrification and denitrification potential in shallower sediment. Since nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by redox conditions, nitrogen cycling in the hyporheic zone of this large-river system likely is affected by dynamics of ground water/surface water interactions that control fluxes of nitrogen and other redox species to hyporheic zone sediment.

25,"Boano, F",Dec 2014 ,"Hyporheic flow and transport processes: Mechanisms, models, and biogeochemical implications",REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS,"Fifty years of hyporheic zone research have shown the important role played by the hyporheic zone as an interface between groundwater and surface waters. However, it is only in the last two decades that what began as an empirical science has become a mechanistic science devoted to modeling studies of the complex fluid dynamical and biogeochemical mechanisms occurring in the hyporheic zone. These efforts have led to the picture of surface-subsurface water interactions as regulators of the form and function of fluvial ecosystems. Rather than being isolated systems, surface water bodies continuously interact with the subsurface. Exploration of hyporheic zone processes has led to a new appreciation of their wide reaching consequences for water quality and stream ecology. Modern research aims toward a unified approach, in which processes occurring in the hyporheic zone are key elements for the appreciation, management, and restoration of the whole river environment. In this unifying context, this review summarizes results from modeling studies and field observations about flow and transport processes in the hyporheic zone and describes the theories proposed in hydrology and fluid dynamics developed to quantitatively model and predict the hyporheic transport of water, heat, and dissolved and suspended compounds from sediment grain scale up to the watershed scale.

26,"FINDLAY, S",Jan 1995 ,IMPORTANCE OF SURFACE-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE IN STREAM ECOSYSTEMS - THE HYPORHEIC ZONE,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"In many streams, significant amounts of water are exchanged between saturated sediments surrounding the open channel (the hyporheic zone) and the channel itself. Such exchanges with the hyporheic zone have the potential to cause large changes in streamwater chemistry because the rates of biogeochemical processes and the actual types of processes (e.g. anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism) may be fundamentally different. I propose an organizational scheme for grouping stream systems into clusters of minimal, moderate, and maximal contribution of hyporheic metabolism to the overall ecosystem. Lack of information on quantitative hydrology for different stream systems prohibits actual testing of this framework. An alternative scheme is presented that organizes several well-studied streams as a function of subsurface residence time and differences in oxygen content. This second scheme is intended to stimulate discussion of conceptual frameworks for cross-system comparisons of the importance of hyporheic sediments in stream ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1995QT29200015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIMPORTANCE%2BOF%2BSURFACE-SUBSURFACE%2BEXCHANGE%2BIN%2BSTREAM%2BECOSYSTEMS%2B-%2BTHE%2BHYPORHEIC%2BZONE%26rft.aufirst%3DS%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFINDLAY%26rft.date%3D1995%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.1995.40.1.0159%26rft.epage%3D164%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D159-164%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D159%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D40&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"Wondzell, SM",Mar 15 2010 ,An analysis of alternative conceptual models relating hyporheic exchange flow to diel fluctuations in discharge during baseflow recession,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Diel fluctuations in stream flow during baseflow have been observed in many streams and are typically attributed to water losses from evapotranspiration (ET). However, there is no widely transferable conceptual model that explains how ET results in diel fluctuations in streamflow at the watershed outlet. For fluctuations to occur, two factors must be present: (1) some process must generate the fluctuations and transfer them to the stream channel, and (2) fluctuations must be accumulated and transported down the stream network in such a way that they arrive at a stream gauge as a coherent signal. We have previously shown how stream flow velocity affects the transport of diel fluctuations in discharge through a stream network. Here, we examined how riparian ET and hyporheic exchange flows generate diel fluctuations in discharge. We hypothesized that ET would cause a slight drawdown of riparian aquifers during the day, slightly increasing head gradients away from the stream and slightly reducing head gradients back to the stream. Thus, slightly more water would flow into the hyporheic zone than is returned to the stream, gradually reducing stream discharge. The process would be reversed at night. Using stream-tracer experiments and riparian water-level data, we tested two hypotheses related to this conceptual model-that the amplitude (H1) and time lag (H2) of diel aquifer drawdown would be constant over the summer. Neither hypothesis was supported by our data. We conclude that the processes that link watershed ET with streams include both local- and watershed-scale effects. Conceptual models attempting to explain diel fluctuations need to include the combined effects of ET on lateral inputs and hyporheic exchange flows, the redistribution of water within riparian aquifers, and the transport of ET signals from the whole stream network to the stream gauge.

28,"Wilhelmsen, K",Sep 2021 ,Laboratory Flume and Numerical Modeling Experiments Show Log Jams and Branching Channels Increase Hyporheic Exchange,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Log jams alter gradients in hydraulic head, increase the area available for hyporheic exchange by creating backwater areas, and lead to the formation of multiple channel branches and bars that drive additional exchange. Here, we numerically simulated stream-groundwater interactions for two constructed flume systems-one without jams and one with a series of three jams-to quantify the effects of interacting jam structures and channel branches on hyporheic exchange at three stream flow rates. In simulations without jams, average hyporheic exchange rates ranged from 2.1 x 10(-4) to 2.9 x 10(-4) m/s for various stream discharge scenarios, but with jams, exchange rates increased to a range of 1.3 x 10(-3)-3.5 x 10(-3) m/s. Largely due to these increased hyporheic exchange rates, jams increased stream-groundwater connectivity or decreased the turnover length that stream water travels before interacting with the hyporheic zone, by an order of magnitude, and drove long flow paths that connected multiple jams and channel threads. Decreased turnover lengths corresponded with greater reaction significance per km, a measure of the potential for the hyporheic zone to influence stream water chemistry. For low-flow conditions, log jams increased reaction significance per km five-fold, from 0.07 to 0.35. Jams with larger volumes led to longer hyporheic residence times and path lengths that exhibited multiple scales of exchange. Additionally, the longest flow paths connecting multiple jams occurred in the reach with multiple channel branches. These findings suggest that large gains in hydrologic connectivity can be achieved by promoting in-stream wood accumulation and the natural formation of both jams and branching channels.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000703704400048,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2021WR030299%26rft.atitle%3DLaboratory%2BFlume%2Band%2BNumerical%2BModeling%2BExperiments%2BShow%2BLog%2BJams%2Band%2BBranching%2BChannels%2BIncrease%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%26rft.aufirst%3DK.%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DWilhelmsen%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2021WR030299%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DWilhelmsen%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DWohl%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
29,"Nutzmann, G",Jun 30 2014 ,Coupled groundwater flow and heat transport simulation for estimating transient aquifer-stream exchange at the lowland River Spree (Germany),HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Subsurface flow and heat transport near Freienbrink, NE Germany, was simulated in order to study groundwater-surface water exchange between a floodplains aquifer and a section of the lowland River Spree and an adjacent oxbow. Groundwater exfiltration was the dominant process, and only fast surface water level rises resulted in temporary infiltration into the aquifer. The main groundwater flow paths are identified based on a 3D groundwater flow model. To estimate mass fluxes across the aquifer-surface water interfaces, a 2D flow and heat transport modelling approach along a transect of 12 piezometers was performed. Results of steady-state and transient water level simulations show an overall high accuracy with a Spearman coefficient =0.9996 and root mean square error (RMSE)=0.008m. Based on small groundwater flow velocities of about 10-7 to 10-6ms-1, mean groundwater exfiltration rates of 233lm-2 d-1 are calculated. Short periods of surface water infiltration into the aquifer do not exceed 10days, and the infiltration rates are in the same range. The heat transport was modelled with slightly less accuracy (=0.8359 and RMSE=0.34 degrees C). In contrast to the predominant groundwater exfiltration, surface water temperatures determine the calculated temperatures in the upper aquifer below both surface water bodies down to 10m during the whole simulation period. These findings emphasize prevailing of heat conduction over advection in the upper aquifer zones, which seems to be typical for lowland streams with sandy aquifer materials and low hydraulic gradients. Moreover, this study shows the potential of coupled numerical flow and heat transport modelling to understand groundwater-surface water exchange processes in detail.

30,"Byrne, P",Aug 15 2014 ,Control of river stage on the reactive chemistry of the hyporheic zone,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"We examined the influence of river stage on subsurface hydrology and pore water chemistry within the hyporheic zone of a groundwater-fed river during the summer baseflow period of 2011. We found river stage and geomorphologic environment to control chemical patterns in the hyporheic zone. At a high river stage, the flux of upwelling water in the shallow sediments (>20 cm) decreased at sample sites in the upper section of our study reach and increased substantially at sites in the lower section. This differential response is attributed to the contrasting geomorphology of these subreaches that affects the rate of the rise and fall of a river stage relative to the subsurface head. At sites where streamward vertical flux decreased, concentration profiles of a conservative environmental tracer suggest surface water infiltration into the riverbed below depths recorded at a low river stage. An increase in vertical flux at sites in the lower subreach is attributed to the movement of lateral subsurface waters originating from the adjacent floodplain. This lateral-moving water preserved or decreased the vertical extent of the hyporheic mixing zone observed at a low river stage. Downwelling surface water appeared to be responsible for elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and manganese (Mn) concentrations in shallow sediments (0-20 cm); however, lateral subsurface flows were probably important for elevated concentrations of these solutes at deeper levels. Results suggest that DOC delivered to hyporheic sediments during a high river stage from surface water and lateral subsurface sources could enhance heterotrophic microbial activities.

31,"Bianchin, MS",Aug 18 2011 ,Defining the hyporheic zone in a large tidally influenced river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"An investigation was conducted to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the hyporheic zone of a large tidally influenced river. The field site is located on the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, approximately 30 km from its outlet to the ocean. The physical attributes of the riverbed were mapped using geophysical techniques coupled with sediment sampling. The spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater composition beneath the riverbed was determined through detailed profiling. Contaminated (fresh) groundwater discharges through a narrow band of the riverbed at a distance approximately 88-105 m from the shoreline coinciding with the termination of a massive silty unit. Saline groundwater, as part of a regional flow system, dominates the riverbed sediments from 105 m beyond the shoreline towards the centre of channel. Three water types occur within the upper 2 m of the riverbed sediments; a result of both mixing of river water, contaminated (fresh) groundwater, and saline groundwater and modification by cation exchange reactions. The interaction of these waters produced distinct zones of Ca-HCO3-, Na-Cl, and Ca-Cl type waters. The distribution of groundwater solutes indicates that during a single tidal cycle, river water penetrates the riverbed to a depth of approximately 15 cm but the long term effects of tidal pumping of river water into the riverbed is observed to a depth of approximately 1 m below the river bed.

32,"Morley, SA",Feb 2021 ,Invertebrate and Microbial Response to Hyporheic Restoration of an Urban Stream,WATER,"All cities face complex challenges managing urban stormwater while also protecting urban water bodies. Green stormwater infrastructure and process-based restoration offer alternative strategies that prioritize watershed connectivity. We report on a new urban floodplain restoration technique being tested in the City of Seattle, USA: an engineered hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone has long been an overlooked component in floodplain restoration. Yet this subsurface area offers enormous potential for stormwater amelioration and is a critical component of healthy streams. From 2014 to 2017, we measured hyporheic temperature, nutrients, and microbial and invertebrate communities at three paired stream reaches with and without hyporheic restoration. At two of the three pairs, water temperature was significantly lower at the restored reach, while dissolved organic carbon and microbial metabolism were higher. Hyporheic invertebrate density and taxa richness were significantly higher across all three restored reaches. These are some of the first quantified responses of hyporheic biological communities to restoration. Our results complement earlier reports of enhanced hydrologic and chemical functioning of the engineered hyporheic zone. Together, this research demonstrates that incorporation of hyporheic design elements in floodplain restoration can enhance temperature moderation, habitat diversity, contaminant filtration, and the biological health of urban streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000624892100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B481%26rft.atitle%3DInvertebrate%2Band%2BMicrobial%2BResponse%2Bto%2BHyporheic%2BRestoration%2Bof%2Ban%2BUrban%2BStream%26rft.aufirst%3DSarah%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DSA%26rft.aulast%3DMorley%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw13040481%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D13%26rft.au%3DMorley%252C%2BSA%26rft.au%3DRhodes%252C%2BLD%26rft.au%3DLynch%252C%2BKD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
33,"Ryan, RJ",Jun 15 2007 ,Lateral and longitudinal variation of hyporheic exchange in a piedmont stream pool,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"A conservative solute tracer experiment was conducted in Indian Creek, a small urban stream in Philadelphia, PA, to investigate the role of subsurface properties on the exchange between streamwater and the hyporheic zone (subsurface surrounding the stream). Sodium bromide (NaBr) was used as a conservative tracer, and it was monitored in the surface water and in the bed sediments of a 15 m long pool. Subsurface sampling occurred at 12 locations in the upper layer sediments (extending from 7.5 to 10 cm below the streambed) and 13 locations in the lower layer sediments (extending from 10 to 12.5 cm below the streambed). The hydraulic conductivity (K) of the upper bed sediments and the lower bed sediments was measured in situ. Several locations within the streambed exhibited an increase in tracer concentration with depth, suggesting the presence of horizontal flow paths within this small pool. Over the entire pool, the influence of K heterogeneity on hyporheic exchange was masked by the groundwater head gradient and the morphology of the stream. Together, the groundwater head gradient and stream morphology induced a generally high tracer concentration and fast hyporheic exchange on the left side and center of the channel and low concentrations and slower exchange on the right side. Although the reach-scale effects on the surface water concentration were small, groundwater greatly influenced the local-scale hyporheic exchange in the pool. Understanding how physical stream characteristics control the location and extent of hyporheic exchange pathways will lead to a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and contaminants.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000247187600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLateral%2Band%2Blongitudinal%2Bvariation%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Ba%2Bpiedmont%2Bstream%2Bpool%26rft.aufirst%3DRobert%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DRJ%26rft.aulast%3DRyan%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1021%252Fes061603z%26rft.eissn%3D1520-5851%26rft.epage%3D4226%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0013-936X%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2B%2526%2BTECHNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4221-4226%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4221%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BTECHNOL%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DRyan%252C%2BRJ%26rft.au%3DBoufadel%252C%2BMC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+%26+TECHNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We investigated the effect of fine sediment (<2 mm) removal on invertebrate assemblages in the shallow hyporheic zones of two chalk rivers using a field experimental approach. We used colonization chambers containing one of two treatments: control and unclogged sediments. Anions, cations and dissolved oxygen did not differ significantly between treatments suggesting good connectivity between surface and hyporheic waters. Total Organic Carbon differed significantly between treatments (p < 0.01) and was higher in the control. In the hyporheic assemblage only Oligochaeta abundance differed significantly between treatments (p < 0.01) and was higher in the control. Overall our study suggests that patch-scale restoration of sediments does not alter hyporheic invertebrate community composition in chalk rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000313638200003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPatch%2Bscale%2Bresponse%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Binvertebrates%2Bto%2Bfine%2Bsediment%2Bremoval%2Bin%2Btwo%2Bchalk%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DOctavian%26rft.auinit%3DO%26rft.aulast%3DPacioglu%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F1863-9135%252F2012%252F0388%26rft.epage%3D288%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D283-288%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D283%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D181%26rft.au%3DPacioglu%252C%2BO%26rft.au%3DShaw%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DRobertson%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We carried out a sampling survey in the hyporheic zone of the Tijuca River, in the Tijuca National Park, located in the urban area of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Biological samples from the hyporheic zone were collected in three different stream reaches, in June 2012. The main objectives were: 1) to describe the structure of invertebrate assemblages in the hyporheic zone of a neotropical stream; 2) to apply a reach-scale approach in order to investigate spatial patterns of the hyporheic assemblages in relation to hydrology, depth and microhabitat typology. A total of 1460 individuals were collected and identified in 31 taxa belonging to Nematoda, Annelida, Crustacea, Hydrachnidia and Insecta. The class Insecta dominated the upper layer of the hyporheic zone. Copepods were the most abundant taxon among crustaceans and occurred mostly in the upwelling areas of the reaches.

36,"Schindler, JE",Nov 1998 ,The hyporheic zone as a source of dissolved organic carbon and carbon gases to a temperate forested stream,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"The objective of this study was to examine chemical changes in porewaters that occur over small scales (cm) as groundwater flows through the hyporheic zone and discharges to a stream in a temperate forest of northern Wisconsin. Hyporheic-zone porewaters were sampled at discrete depths of 2, 10, 15, 61, and 183 cm at three study sites in the study basin. Chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, CH4, and pH show dramatic changes between 61 cm sediment depth and the water-sediment interface. Unless discrete samples at small depth intervals are taken, these chemical profiles are not accounted for. Similar trends were observed at the three study locations, despite each site having very different hydraulic-flow regimes. Increases in DOC concentration by an order of magnitude from 61 to 15 cm depth with a corresponding decrease in pH and rapid decreases in the molecular weight of the DOC suggest that aliphatic compounds (likely organic acids) are being generated in the hyporheic zone. Estimated efflux rates of DOG, CO2, and CH4 to the stream are 6.2, 0.79, 0.13 moles m(2) d(-1), respectively, with the vast majority of these materials produced in the hyporheic zone.

The factor analysis identified four main factors that explain 67 % of total variance of the water chemistry data and also revealed that the parameters responsible for water quality variances were mainly related to rainfall, anthropogenic activities, and dissolution of carbonate minerals. The cluster analysis produced a few different groups in August (3 groups), September (4 groups), and November (4 groups), respectively, which showed that the water quality parameters of the three water bodies were very different and the hyporheic water showed a different mixing of the stream water and groundwater at each monitoring point.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000330624700009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater%2Band%2Bstream%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Brevealed%2Bby%2Bwater%2Bchemistry%2Bin%2Ba%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bagricultural%2Barea%26rft.aufirst%3DHeejung%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DKim%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10333-013-0363-5%26rft.eissn%3D1611-2504%26rft.epage%3D101%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1611-2490%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DPADDY%2BAND%2BWATER%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D89-101%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D89%26rft.stitle%3DPADDY%2BWATER%2BENVIRON%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DKim%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BJY%26rft.au%3DLee%252C%2BKK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=PADDY+AND+WATER+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
38,"Maazouzi, C",Sep 2017 ,Do benthic invertebrates use hyporheic refuges during streambed drying? A manipulative field experiment in nested hyporheic flowpaths,ECOHYDROLOGY,"The existence of resilience mechanisms related to a disturbance, such as invertebrate migrations into the hyporheic zone (HZ, saturated subsurface interstices), promotes persistence of benthic communities in river ecosystems. Water exchanges through the HZ, which influence the distribution of biota, are heterogeneous at different scales, determining nested hyporheic flowpaths. The effect of these nested exchanges on the use of the hyporheic refuges by benthic invertebrates is still unknown. We simulated streambed drying in a stream section where hydrological exchanges were considered at riffle (upstream or downstream of riffles) and floodplain (downstream end of a floodplain) scales. Physicochemical indicators determined that local hyporheic flowpaths (up-and downwelling zones) were nested in a large-scale downwelling section of the river. In this situation, the effect of 24 h of experimental drying on the distribution of invertebrates was examined at three sediment depths to follow their migrations into the HZ. Whereas invertebrate assemblages did not change in the control channel, abundance of benthic invertebrate increased in the HZ of the impact channel (up to seven-fold). Changes occurred rapidly (15-24 h) and only upstream of riffle where surface water down-welled. The migration was taxon-specific and concerned the most abundant benthic taxa that temporarily colonize the HZ (""temporary hyporheos,"" e.g., Leuctra cf. fusca, Baetis sp., Caenis sp., Orthocladiinae, Tanypodinae). In the context of climate change, hyporheic refuge use will promote persistence of communities facing the increasing frequency of extreme hydrological events. Improved knowledge about the distribution and function of these refuges is becoming crucial for river managers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000410633100017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be1865%26rft.atitle%3DDo%2Bbenthic%2Binvertebrates%2Buse%2Bhyporheic%2Brefuges%2Bduring%2Bstreambed%2Bdrying%253F%2BA%2Bmanipulative%2Bfield%2Bexperiment%2Bin%2Bnested%2Bhyporheic%2Bflowpaths%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DMaazouzi%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Feco.1865%26rft.eissn%3D1936-0592%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1936-0584%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DECOHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOHYDROLOGY%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DMaazouzi%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DGalassi%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DDole-Olivier%252C%2BMJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=ECOHYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
39,"Wang, NR",Dec 2018 ,Transverse hyporheic flow in the cross-section of a compound river system,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,"Previous studies of bedform-induced hyporheic flow focused on processes driven by longitudinal hydraulic head variations at the sediment-water interface (SWI) due to river flow and bedform interactions. By way of numerical simulations, we examined the transverse hyporheic flow in a river system with compound sections, comprising a main river channel and a floodplain connected by a bank. The results show that head fluctuations across the compound beds associated with the transverse secondary flow can cause significant lateral hyporheic flow through two pore water circulating cells. Such a 2-D compound bedfrom have a higher flux across the SWI than the 2-D longitudinal dunes since the 2-D compound cross-section form induces more drag. The circulating flow cells originate from the bank surface and terminate at the main channel and floodplain bed surfaces, respectively. The hyporheic exchange concentrates on the bank region below the SWI where an intensive solute transfer concurrently occurred. The head gradient along the SWI is sensitive to the bank slope angle, which consequently determines transverse hyporheic flow dynamics and solute transport processes. Larger bank slope angles induce higher hyporheic fluxes and smaller hyporheic areas and residence time. The effects of increasing flux on solute transport in the compound section are partly influenced by a sharply decreasing hyporheic area. Thus the solute consequently transfers downward within the hyporheic zone with a lower rate at larger bank slope angle. Larger river discharges may promote both the transverse hyporheic flow and solute transformation across the bed surface. These physical processes may have implications for the biogeochemical processing within the hyporheic zone across a compound river system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000450094200021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTransverse%2Bhyporheic%2Bflow%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bcross-section%2Bof%2Ba%2Bcompound%2Briver%2Bsystem%26rft.aufirst%3DNairu%26rft.auinit%3DNR%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.advwatres.2018.10.006%26rft.eissn%3D1872-9657%26rft.epage%3D277%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1708%26rft.jtitle%3DADVANCES%2BIN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D263-277%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D263%26rft.stitle%3DADV%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%26rft.volume%3D122%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BNR%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BCM%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=ADVANCES+IN+WATER+RESOURCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
40,"Ward, AS",Jan-feb 2019 ,Advancing our predictive understanding of river corridor exchange,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"Despite decades of research, we lack an accurate framework to predict and manage hydrologic exchange in the river corridor and the associated ecosystem services and functions at the scales of stream reaches and entire networks. While many individual studies have been conducted to investigate specific mechanisms, they have not been synthesized to account for heterogeneity in space, nonstationarity, and multiscale feedbacks that typify the river corridor. As a result, contradictory predictions of exchange flux, geometry, and timescale are prevalent in the literature. We attribute these contradictions to (a) failure to account for multiscale feedbacks and (b) uncertainty in the information content of common measurement methods. Here, we apply the concept of interacting multiscale spatial and time-variable domains to the river corridor to demonstrate why more complete multiscale characterization is necessary to achieve predictive understanding. Next, we highlight uncertainties and inconsistencies in measurement methods which may obfuscate our understanding of river corridor exchange. Finally, we briefly outline four necessary advances to achieve predictive understanding of river corridor exchange: standardization of metadata, critical evaluation of the information content and support volumes for measurement techniques, multiscale model-data integration, and advancing theoretical models of river corridor exchange.

41,"Johnson, ZC",Mar 14 2014 ,Factors affecting hyporheic and surface transient storage in a western US river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hyporheic storage accounts for a significant fraction of solute residence time in small streams and has been shown to have a large effect on the transport of solutes. It is not clear whether this characteristic is preserved in larger streams and rivers, as increased discharge and decreased slope may reduce overall exchange between the channel and subsurface, and the size of surface storage zones may increase. Conservative tracer tests conducted in the Truckee River, a stream with mean annual discharge >0.5 m(3) s(-1), were simulated with both one (1-SZ) and two-storage zone (2-SZ) transport models to quantify the relative role of surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) on the physical transport of solutes in a large stream. Tracer injections were conducted at two different discharge levels in two reaches with distinct geomorphic characteristics. STS was the dominant storage mechanism for all reaches and discharge levels and surface storage accounted for a larger fraction of median transport time (F-MED(200)) than hyporheic storage in all but one case. Increased discharge significantly reduced the influence of the HTS (primarily) and STS zones on median transport time at the study site. Comparisons with studies of discharge and geomorphic effects on TS characteristics in other streams indicated differing physical controls on STS and HTS zones. Therefore, measurements such as slope, sinuosity, width, depth, and gross gains and losses of discharge need to be considered along with discharge. This work adds to the growing sentiment that up-scaling and prediction of stream storage characteristics based on discharge and channel properties is far from straightforward. Since biogeochemical processing occurs differently in the HTS and STS, two-zone storage models provide necessary representations of transport in river systems for studies focused on aspects of water quality. Extra parameters are required for model optimization but simple cross-section surveys (area and velocity) provide enough information to ensure enhanced parameter reliability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

42,"Hester, ET",Dec 2016 ,Effects of inset floodplains and hyporheic exchange induced by in-stream structures on nitrate removal in a headwater stream,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Stream restoration efforts in the United States are increasingly aimed towards water quality improvement, yet little process-based guidance exists to compare pollutant removals from different restoration techniques for variable site conditions. Excess nitrate (NO3-) is a frequent pollutant of concern due to eutrophication in downstream waterbodies such as the Chesapeake Bay. We used MIKE SHE to simulate hydraulics and NO3- removal in a 90 m restored reach of Stroubles Creek, a second-order stream in Blacks-burg, Virginia. Site specific geomorphic, hydrologic, and hydraulic data were used to calibrate the model. We evaluated in-stream structures that induce hyporheic zone denitrification during baseflow and inset floodplains that remove NO3- during storm flows. We varied hydraulic conditions (winter baseflow, summer baseflow, storm flow), biogeochemical parameters (literature hyporheic zone denitrification rates and newly available inset floodplain removal rates) and boundary conditions (upstream NO3- concentration), sediment conditions (hydraulic conductivity), and stream restoration design parameters (inset floodplain length). Our results indicate that NO3- removal rates within the 90m reach were minimal. Structure-induced hyporheic zone denitrification did not exceed 3.1% of mass flowing in from the upstream channel, was achieved only during favorable background groundwater hydraulic conditions (i.e. summer baseflow), and was transport-limited such that non-trivial removal rates were achieved only when the streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) was at least 10(-4) m/s. Inset floodplain nitrogen removal was limited by floodplain residence time and NO3- removal rate, and did not exceed 1% of inflowing mass. Summing these removals for both restoration practices over the course of the year based on the frequency of storm and summer baseflow conditions yielded similar to 2.1% annual removal. Achieving 30% NO3- removal required increasing the length of stream reach restored to 0.9 km-819 km (depending on hydraulic conductivity) and 3.8-46 km (depending on inset floodplain length and nitrogen removal rate) for in-stream structures during baseflow and inset floodplains during storm flow, respectively. In one of the first comparisons of process-based modeling to the Chesapeake Bay Program stream restoration guidance, we found that the guidance overestimated hyporheic NO3- removal for our modeled reach, but correctly estimated inset floodplain removal. Overall, our results indicate that in-stream structures and inset floodplains can improve water quality, but overall required level of effort may be high to achieve desired results.

43,"Harris, EC",Mar 2020 ,1-D Vertical Flux Dynamics in a Low-Gradient Stream: An Assessment of Stage as a Control of Vertical Hyporheic Exchange,WATER,"This study characterized vertical one-dimensional (1-D) flux rates in the top 150 cm of the streambed and explored the relationship between stage and 1-D vertical flux rates in a low-gradient stream. Six multi-level samplers were installed along a 25 m stretch of the thalweg spaced at 5 m intervals. Each sampler recorded temperature at five separate depths (30, 60, 90, and 150 cm) from February 2009 to March 2010. Temperature and stage data were collected at 15 min intervals. For the midpoint between sensors, 1-D flux rates were calculated using the 1-D conduction-advection-dispersion equation utilized in the VFLUX MATLAB program. The dominant flux direction at a depth of 15 cm was downward (negative), while the average flux directions at depths of 45, 75, and 120 cm were upward (positive). Variable flux directions above 15 cm indicated hyporheic exchange with background upwelling groundwater between 15 to 120 cm. Flux rates approach zero in the summer, representing limited hyporheic exchange. Relationships between stage and flux at the near-surface streambed (15 cm) were weak, but statistically significant, with Spearman's rank correlations for all six multi-level samplers ranging from -0.032 to 0.369 with an average of 0.085.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000529249500093,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B708%26rft.atitle%3D1-D%2BVertical%2BFlux%2BDynamics%2Bin%2Ba%2BLow-Gradient%2BStream%253A%2BAn%2BAssessment%2Bof%2BStage%2Bas%2Ba%2BControl%2Bof%2BVertical%2BHyporheic%2BExchange%26rft.aufirst%3DE.%2BClaire%26rft.auinit%3DEC%26rft.aulast%3DHarris%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12030708%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DHarris%252C%2BEC%26rft.au%3DPeterson%252C%2BEW&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
44,"Toran, L",May 15 2013 ,"Observing lingering hyporheic storage using electrical resistivity: variations around stream restoration structures, Crabby Creek, PA",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Time-lapse geophysical surveys can map lingering hyporheic storage by detecting changes in response to saline tracer. Tracer tests were conducted in Crabby Creek, an urban stream outside Philadelphia, to examine the influence of stream restoration structures and variable sediment thickness. We compared electrical resistivity surveys with extensive well sampling (57 wells) in two 13.5-m-long reaches, each with a step drop created by a J-hook. The two step drops varied in tracer behaviour, based on both the well data and the geophysical data. The well data showed more variation in arrival time where the streambed sediment was thick and was more uniform where sediment was thin. The resistivity in the reach with thin sediment showed lingering tracer in the hyporheic zone both upstream and downstream from the J-hook. In the second reach where the sediment was thicker, the lingering tracer in the hyporheic zone was more extensive downstream from the J-hook. The contrasting results between the two reaches from both methods suggested that sediments influenced hyporheic exchange more than the step at this location. Resistivity inversion differed from well data in both reaches in that it showed evidence for tracer after well samples had returned to background, mapping lingering tracer either upstream or downstream of a step. We conclude that resistivity surveys may become an important tool for hyporheic zone characterization because they provide information on the extent of slow moving fluids in the hyporheic zone, which have the potential to enhance chemical reactions.

45,"Magliozzi, C",Sep 2019 ,Functional traits of hyporheic and benthic invertebrates reveal importance of wood-driven geomorphological processes in rivers,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Large wood (LW) is a natural element of river environments and an integral component of many river restoration schemes to promote biodiversity. It is an important habitat in itself, but it also induces a wide range of hydraulic, hydrological, geomorphological and chemical conditions that influence the ecological community. However, the effects of hydro-geomorphological processes induced by LW on local benthic and hyporheic invertebrates have not been well characterized. A functional approach was applied to invertebrate data collected in a field survey at sites with LW and without LW (control) to investigate the response of hyporheic and benthic invertebrates' trait profiles in response to local LW-induced processes. We hypothesized LW sites to be associated with different trait modalities than control sites in relation to wood-induced processes and conditions (i.e., hyporheic exchange flow, oxygen availability, temporal stability, organic matter, denitrification, hydraulic conductivity). Multivariate analyses and partial least squares (PLS) path modelling were used to detect the differences in trait profiles between LW and control sites and to study the variation of traits as a function of hydrological, sedimentological, physical and chemical variables. Biological (i.e., aquatic stages, reproduction), physiological (i.e., dispersal, feeding habits) and behavioural (i.e., substrate preferences) trait utilization by the hyporheic meiofauna differed between LW and control sites. At LW sites, the hyporheic meiofaunal assemblage was significantly associated with aquatic active dispersal, aquatic eggs and hard substrate preferences. This trait category selection was linked to changes in physical-sedimentological processes at LW sites when compared to control sites. Macrofaunal benthic and hyporheic functional traits did not differ significantly between wood and control sites, suggesting similar functioning of these assemblages at the surface-subsurface interface. This study found that LW affects invertebrate traits by altering fluvial processes to produce, locally, a mosaic of habitats. Hyporheic meiofauna trait responses to LW processes have suggested (a) the crucial role of LW in supporting river benthic zone functioning and thus (b) a possible benefit to river restoration by enhancing functional interactions among different ecological niches.

47,"Aubeneau, AF",Mar 2015 ,Effects of benthic and hyporheic reactive transport on breakthrough curves,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"In streams and rivers, the benthic and hyporheic regions harbor the microbes that process many stream-borne constituents, including O-2, nutrients, C, and contaminants. The full distribution of transport time scales in these highly reactive regions must be understood because solute delivery and extended storage in these metabolically active zones control the opportunity for biogeochemical processing. The most commonly used transport models cannot capture these effects. We present a stochastic model for conservative and reactive solute transport in rivers based on continuous-time random-walk theory, which is capable of distinguishing and capturing processes not described by classical approaches. The model includes surface and subsurface storage zones with arbitrary residence-time distributions. We used this model to evaluate the effects of sorption and biological uptake on downstream solute transport. Linear or mildly nonlinear sorption in storage delays downstream transport without changing the fundamental shape of the breakthrough curves (BTCs). Highly nonlinear sorption isotherms can induce power-law tailing in stream BTCs. Model simulations show that sorption of commonly used solute tracers is not sufficient to explain the power-law tailing that has been observed in field tracer-injection studies, and instead, such tailing most probably reflects broad distributions of hyporheic exchange time scales. First-order biological uptake causes an exponential decline in in-stream tracer concentrations at the time scale of the uptake kinetics, thereby tempering power-law BTCs. The model can be used to calculate reach-scale reaction-rate coefficients in surface and subsurface storage from observed BTCs of co-injected conservative and reactive solutes, providing new capability to determine reaction-rate coefficients in storage zones with broad residence-time distributions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000349995000023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bbenthic%2Band%2Bhyporheic%2Breactive%2Btransport%2Bon%2Bbreakthrough%2Bcurves%26rft.aufirst%3DAntoine%2BF.%26rft.auinit%3DAF%26rft.aulast%3DAubeneau%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F680037%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D315%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D301-315%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D301%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DAubeneau%252C%2BAF%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Grygoruk, M",Dec 3 2021 ,Revealing the influence of hyporheic water exchange on the composition and abundance of bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrates in a temperate lowland river,KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS,"We studied distributions and abundances of macroinvertebrates in relation to hyporheic water exchange (HWE) patterns of the upper Biebrza - a small, lowland, low dynamic European river located in Northeast Poland. On a 6-km stretch of the river; we determined the variability of water exchange in the hyporheic zone by using direct field measurements of the pressure gradient to determine groundwater-surface water interactions. We identified locations with upwelling and downwelling fluxes of HWE as well as ambiguous hydraulic contact between groundwater and surface water along the river. In these locations, we sampled bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrates. In total, 627 individuals of benthic macroinvertebrates of 34 taxa were identified. We revealed that bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrate fauna is more abundant and diverse in river stretches where water from the river infiltrates the hyporheic zone. Results also show higher taxonomic richness and abundances of benthic macroinvertebrates in stretches with diagnosed infiltrating conditions (downwelling flux in a hyporheic zone) compared to in stretches where the river drained groundwater (upwelling flux in a hyporheic zone), but the recorded differences were not statistically significant.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000725827800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B37%26rft.atitle%3DRevealing%2Bthe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bcomposition%2Band%2Babundance%2Bof%2Bbottom-dwelling%2Bmacroinvertebrates%2Bin%2Ba%2Btemperate%2Blowland%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DMateusz%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DGrygoruk%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Fkmae%252F2021036%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1961-9502%26rft.issue%3D422%26rft.jtitle%3DKNOWLEDGE%2BAND%2BMANAGEMENT%2BOF%2BAQUATIC%2BECOSYSTEMS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DKNOWL%2BMANAG%2BAQUAT%2BEC%26rft.au%3DGrygoruk%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DSzalkiewicz%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DOkruszko%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=KNOWLEDGE+AND+MANAGEMENT+OF+AQUATIC+ECOSYSTEMS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Harvey, JW",Oct 2013 ,Hyporheic zone denitrification: Controls on effective reaction depth and contribution to whole-stream mass balance,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Stream denitrification is thought to be enhanced by hyporheic transport but there is little direct evidence from the field. To investigate at a field site, we injected (NO3-)-N-15, Br (conservative tracer), and SF6 (gas exchange tracer) and compared measured whole-stream denitrification with in situ hyporheic denitrification in shallow and deeper flow paths of contrasting geomorphic units. Hyporheic denitrification accounted for between 1 and 200% of whole-stream denitrification. The reaction rate constant was positively related to hyporheic exchange rate (greater substrate delivery), concentrations of substrates DOC and nitrate, microbial denitrifier abundance (nirS), and measures of granular surface area and presence of anoxic microzones. The dimensionless product of the reaction rate constant and hyporheic residence time, (hzhz) define a Damkohler number, Da(den-hz) that was optimal in the subset of hyporheic flow paths where Da(den-hz) approximate to 1. Optimal conditions exclude inefficient deep pathways where substrates are used up and also exclude inefficient shallow pathways that require repeated hyporheic entries and exits to complete the reaction. The whole-stream reaction significance, R-s (dimensionless), was quantified by multiplying Da(den-hz) by the proportion of stream discharge passing through the hyporheic zone. Together these two dimensionless metrics, one flow-path scale and the other reach-scale, quantify the whole-stream significance of hyporheic denitrification. One consequence is that the effective zone of significant denitrification often differs from the full depth of the hyporheic zone, which is one reason why whole-stream denitrification rates have not previously been explained based on total hyporheic-zone metrics such as hyporheic-zone size or residence time.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000327432500013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Bzone%2Bdenitrification%253A%2BControls%2Bon%2Beffective%2Breaction%2Bdepth%2Band%2Bcontribution%2Bto%2Bwhole-stream%2Bmass%2Bbalance%26rft.aufirst%3DJudson%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DJW%26rft.aulast%3DHarvey%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20492%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D6316%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6298-6316%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6298%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DHarvey%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DBohlke%252C%2BJK%26rft.au%3DTobias%252C%2BCR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6FldGNzeASPObrgeEW1jI&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
