0,"Brinkerhoff, CB",Oct 2022 ,Remotely Sensing River Greenhouse Gas Exchange Velocity Using the SWOT Satellite,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,"Two decades of research has shown that the global river network emits significant amounts of greenhouse gas. Despite much progress, there is still large uncertainty in the temporal dynamics of gas exchange and thus carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Much of this uncertainty stems from a lack of existing tools for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of gas exchange velocity k600 ${k}_{600}$ (the rate of this diffusive transport). We propose that the NASA/CNES/UKSA/CSA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite can provide new insights to fluvial gas exchange modeling upon launch and subsequent data collection in 2022. Here, we exploit the distinct geomorphology of SWOT-observable rivers (>50 m wide) to develop a physical model of gas exchange that is remotely sensible and explains 50% of log-transformed variation across 166 field measurements of k600 ${k}_{600}$. We then couple this model with established inversion techniques to develop BIKER, the ""Bayesian Inference of the k600 ${k}_{600}$ Exchange Rate"" algorithm. We validate BIKER on 47 SWOT-simulated rivers without an in-situ calibration, yielding an algorithm that predicts the k600 ${k}_{600}$ timeseries solely from SWOT observations with a by-river median Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.21. BIKER is better at inferring the temporal variation of gas exchange (median correlation coefficient of 0.91), than reproducing the absolute rates of exchange (median normalized RMSE of 51%). Finally, BIKER is robust to measurement errors implicit in the SWOT data. We suggest that BIKER will be useful in mapping global-scale fluvial gas exchange and improving CO2 $\left[\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}\right]$ emissions estimates when coupled with river CO2 $\left[\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}\right]$ models.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000866080000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2022GB007419%26rft.atitle%3DRemotely%2BSensing%2BRiver%2BGreenhouse%2BGas%2BExchange%2BVelocity%2BUsing%2Bthe%2BSWOT%2BSatellite%26rft.aufirst%3DCraig%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DCB%26rft.aulast%3DBrinkerhoff%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2022GB007419%26rft.eissn%3D1944-9224%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0886-6236%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEMICAL%2BCYCLES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEM%2BCY%26rft.volume%3D36%26rft.au%3DBrinkerhoff%252C%2BCB%26rft.au%3DGleason%252C%2BCJ%26rft.au%3DHarlan%252C%2BME&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=GLOBAL+BIOGEOCHEMICAL+CYCLES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Mas-Pla, J",Jan 2013 ,Basement Groundwater as a Complementary Resource for Overexploited Stream-Connected Alluvial Aquifers,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"The use of groundwater from alluvial aquifers largely affects stream discharge by capturing the stream resources. This affects hydrological processes and riparian biodiversity. In this study, complementary water resources are investigated in an effort to ease human pressure on alluvial systems and, eventually, on stream-aquifer relationships. Discharge and hydrochemical data along a 5 km reach of the Tordera River (NE Spain) provide evidence that groundwater fluxes, associated with a regional hydrogeological system related to the basement fracture network, contribute to alluvial recharge and to stream flow. End-member mixing analysis considering upstream discharge, groundwater flows, and human inputs to the stream as major flow sources shows that regional basement groundwater fluxes are responsible for as much as 20 % of the total discharge, which also explains unexpected rises in stream flow. This suggests a possible new approach to local water resources planning, indicating that conjunctive use might actually be feasible.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000312731300018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBasement%2BGroundwater%2Bas%2Ba%2BComplementary%2BResource%2Bfor%2BOverexploited%2BStream-Connected%2BAlluvial%2BAquifers%26rft.aufirst%3DJosep%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DMas-Pla%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11269-012-0186-y%26rft.epage%3D308%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0920-4741%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D293-308%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D293%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BMANAG%26rft.volume%3D27%26rft.au%3DMas-Pla%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DMencio%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DMarsinach%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
2,"Zhang, T",Nov 2019 ,"Carbon dioxide exchanges and their controlling factors in Guijiang River, SW China",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The important flux estimate of carbon exchange across the water-air interface in river systems of the global carbon cycle are being increasingly recognized. However, these estimates have large uncertainty due to the incomplete temporal and spatial coverage of CO2 flux. Here, we evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics and controlling factors of CO2 exchange across the water-air interface and their potential role in regional and global carbon budgets in 25 river transects along Guijiang River (GJR), southwestern China, in July and December 2016. These river transects were divided into upstream (US), middle (MS), and downstream (DS) reaches in non-karst, karst and mixed areas, respectively. The riverine CO2 fluxes showed obvious seasonal variations, ranging from 5.62 +/- 5.93 g/(m(2).d) in summer to 1.25 +/- 4.02 g/(m(2).d) in winter, with an average value of 3.44 +/- 5.48 g/(m(2).d). The riverine CO2 fluxes exhibited significant spatial patterns, where the highest and lowest averaged CO2 fluxes occurred at MS in summer and winter, respectively. Generally, the river was a carbon source with respect to the atmosphere throughout the year. However, the CO2 fluxes were obviously restrained by aquatic metabolism and the carbonate buffer system in winter. Additionally, the absorbed CO2 at MS was due to strong photosynthetic and carbonate buffer activities. Carbon loss via atmospheric exchange in the GJR river basin was 0.032 +/- 0.047 Tg C/yr, which accounted for 20.1% of the riverine dissolved carbon fluxes (0.160 +/- 0.075 Tg C/yr). Thus, 0.128Tg C yr(-1) was sequestered in the GJR basin. Our results demonstrate the need to emphasize the importance of aquatic photosynthesis and the carbonate buffer system in restraining CO2 degassing in karst rivers. It is important to underscore the detailed spatiotemporal changes in CO2 flux to reduce uncertainty in current estimates of global riverine CO2 emissions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000497250200047,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124073%26rft.atitle%3DCarbon%2Bdioxide%2Bexchanges%2Band%2Btheir%2Bcontrolling%2Bfactors%2Bin%2BGuijiang%2BRiver%252C%2BSW%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DTao%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2019.124073%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D578%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DYuan%252C%2BDX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
3,"Valle-Levinson, A",Jan 2012 ,Impact of record flooding of a subtropical river on estuary/ocean exchange,OCEAN DYNAMICS,"Measurements of current velocity profiles during and after cresting of the Suwannee River in Northern Florida, USA, were used to investigate the effects of increased river discharge on subtidal flows near the estuarine transition with the Gulf of Mexico. Three moored velocity profilers were deployed across a lower estuary cross-section. The cross-section bathymetry consisted of a channel (similar to 5.5 m deep) near the western bank of the estuary that shoaled monotonically eastward. Two-layer gravitational exchange developed only in the deepest part of the cross-section during the river cresting and persisted for similar to 20 days. After this similar to 20-day period, the net flow decreased and was seaward throughout the water column. Net flows outside the channel were seaward throughout the observation period and were modulated by the river pulse. By comparing the estuarine response in the 5.5-m channel to theoretical responses driven by a dynamic balance between pressure gradient and stress divergence, a condition required for two-layered flow was proposed. Gravitational exchange flow should be expected when the ratio of density-driven flow to river-induced flow is greater than 0.23 to 0.28. Smaller values of this ratio should produce unidirectional, seaward flows after a river pulse. Two-layered flows restricted to the channel can be explained also with this ratio because of the sensitivity of density-driven flows to local depth and eddy viscosity. These findings need to be tested against observations in other systems affected by extreme freshwater pulses.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000299030900006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2Brecord%2Bflooding%2Bof%2Ba%2Bsubtropical%2Briver%2Bon%2Bestuary%252Focean%2Bexchange%26rft.aufirst%3DArnoldo%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DValle-Levinson%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10236-011-0491-7%26rft.epage%3D85%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1616-7341%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DOCEAN%2BDYNAMICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D77-85%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D77%26rft.stitle%3DOCEAN%2BDYNAM%26rft.volume%3D62&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=OCEAN+DYNAMICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
4,"Butturini, A",Aug 23 2005 ,Modeling storm events to investigate the influence of the stream-catchment interface zone on stream biogeochemistry,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We formulate a new mixing model to explore hydrological and chemical conditions under which the interface between the stream and catchment interface (SCI) influences the release of reactive solutes into stream water during storms. Physically, the SCI corresponds to the hyporheic/riparian sediments. In the new model this interface is coupled through a bidirectional water exchange to the conventional two components mixing model. Simulations show that the influence of the SCI on stream solute dynamics during storms is detectable when the runoff event is dominated by the infiltrated groundwater component that flows through the SCI before entering the stream and when the flux of solutes released from SCI sediments is similar to, or higher than, the solute flux carried by the groundwater. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate data from two small Mediterranean streams obtained during storms are compared to results from simulations using the new model to discern the circumstances under which the SCI is likely to control the dynamics of reactive solutes in streams. The simulations and the comparisons with empirical data suggest that the new mixing model may be especially appropriate for streams in which the periodic, or persistent, abrupt changes in the level of riparian groundwater exert hydrologic control on flux of biologically reactive fluxes between the riparian/hyporheic compartment and the stream water.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000231573900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08418%26rft.atitle%3DModeling%2Bstorm%2Bevents%2Bto%2Binvestigate%2Bthe%2Binfluence%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bstream-catchment%2Binterface%2Bzone%2Bon%2Bstream%2Bbiogeochemistry%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DButturini%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2004WR003842%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DButturini%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBernal%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DSabater%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
5,"Song, JX",Apr 2010 ,"Variability of streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity with depth along the Elkhorn River, Nebraska, USA",CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN,"Determination of streambed hydraulic conductivity is of great importance in the analysis of stream-aquifer interactions and stream ecosystems. In this paper, in situ falling-head standpipe permeameter tests were conducted to determine streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity (K (v) ) of two connected layers of sediments at 60 test locations from eight sites in the Elkhorn River, Nebraska. Our results show that the K (v) values for the upper layer of sediments are generally larger than those in their respective lower layer of sediments. The individual K (v) value for the upper layer of sediments from all test locations of the eight sites range from 2.7 to 104.9 m/d, and the average value is 26.6 m/d. The individual K (v) value ranges from 0.4 to 73.4 m/d and the average value is 16.1 m/d for the lower layer of sediments. We believe that hyporheic processes can enhance larger streambed K (v) in the upper layer of sediments. Inflow and outflow through hyporheic zone produce more porous and permeable sediments and further result in an increasing of streambed K (v) . Moreover, we observe that bioturbation activities can destroy the clogging layer of the exposed sediments and create pore spaces in the sediments, which also further increases streambed K (v) .Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000276483000016,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVariability%2Bof%2Bstreambed%2Bvertical%2Bhydraulic%2Bconductivity%2Bwith%2Bdepth%2Balong%2Bthe%2BElkhorn%2BRiver%252C%2BNebraska%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DJinxi%26rft.auinit%3DJX%26rft.aulast%3DSong%2BJinXi%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11434-009-0640-2%26rft.epage%3D999%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1001-6538%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DCHINESE%2BSCIENCE%2BBULLETIN%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D992-999%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D992%26rft.stitle%3DCHINESE%2BSCI%2BBULL%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXH%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BWK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=CHINESE+SCIENCE+BULLETIN&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

7,"Caldwell, RJ",Jul 2013 ,"Statistical modeling of daily and subdaily stream temperatures: Application to the Methow River Basin, Washington",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Management of water temperatures in the Columbia River Basin (Washington) is critical because water projects have substantially altered the habitat of Endangered Species Act listed species, such as salmon, throughout the basin. This is most important in tributaries to the Columbia, such as the Methow River, where the spawning and rearing life stages of these cold water fishes occurs. Climate change projections generally predict increasing air temperatures across the western United States, with less confidence regarding shifts in precipitation. As air temperatures rise, we anticipate a corresponding increase in water temperatures, which may alter the timing and availability of habitat for fish reproduction and growth. To assess the impact of future climate change in the Methow River, we couple historical climate and future climate projections with a statistical modeling framework to predict daily mean stream temperatures. A K-nearest neighbor algorithm is also employed to: (i) adjust the climate projections for biases compared to the observed record and (ii) provide a reference for performing spatiotemporal disaggregation in future hydraulic modeling of stream habitat. The statistical models indicate the primary drivers of stream temperature are maximum and minimum air temperature and stream flow and show reasonable skill in predictability. When compared to the historical reference time period of 1916-2006, we conclude that increases in stream temperature are expected to occur at each subsequent time horizon representative of the year 2020, 2040, and 2080, with an increase of 0.8 +/- 1.9 degrees C by the year 2080.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000323419100033,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStatistical%2Bmodeling%2Bof%2Bdaily%2Band%2Bsubdaily%2Bstream%2Btemperatures%253A%2BApplication%2Bto%2Bthe%2BMethow%2BRiver%2BBasin%252C%2BWashington%26rft.aufirst%3DR.%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DRJ%26rft.aulast%3DCaldwell%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fwrcr.20353%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4361%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4346-4361%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4346%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DCaldwell%252C%2BRJ%26rft.au%3DGangopadhyay%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DElsner%252C%2BMM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
8,"Wu, YF",Oct 2020 ,SST Warming in Recent Decades in the Gulf Stream Extension Region and Its Impact on Atmospheric Rivers,ATMOSPHERE,"The sea surface temperature (SST) front in the Gulf Stream (GS) extension region is important to synoptic variations in atmosphere. In winter, large amounts of heat and moisture are released from the SST front, modulating the baroclinicity and humidity of the atmosphere, which is important for extratropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers (ARs). In this study, the variation of SST in the North Atlantic in winters since 1981 is investigated using satellite and reanalysis datasets, and a 23-year (1997 to 2019) warming trend of SST in the GS extension region is detected. The increase of SST is mainly distributed along the SST front, with more than 2 degrees C warming and a northward shift of the SST gradient from 1997 to 2019. Connected with the SST warming, significant increases in turbulent heat flux and moisture release into the atmosphere were found along the ocean front. As a result, baroclinic instability, upward water vapor flux and AR occurrence frequency increased in recent decades. Meanwhile, there was an increase in extreme rainfall along with the increase in AR landfalling on continental Western Europe (especially in the Iberian Peninsula and on the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000584065100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1109%26rft.atitle%3DSST%2BWarming%2Bin%2BRecent%2BDecades%2Bin%2Bthe%2BGulf%2BStream%2BExtension%2BRegion%2Band%2BIts%2BImpact%2Bon%2BAtmospheric%2BRivers%26rft.aufirst%3DYifei%26rft.auinit%3DYF%26rft.aulast%3DWu%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fatmos11101109%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4433%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DATMOSPHERE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DATMOSPHERE-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BYF%26rft.au%3DJia%252C%2BYL%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=ATMOSPHERE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
9,"Dallmann, J",Aug 2020 ,Impacts of Suspended Clay Particle Deposition on Sand-Bed Morphodynamics,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Fine particles (0.1-100 microns) are ubiquitous within the water column. Observations on the interactions between suspended fine particles and sediment beds remain limited, reducing our ability to understand the interactions and feedbacks between fine particles, morphodynamics, and hyporheic flow. We performed laboratory experiments to explore changes in bedform morphodynamics and hyporheic flow following the progressive addition of kaolinite clay to the water column above a mobile sand bed. We characterized these interactions by taking high-frequency time series measurements of bed topography and freestream clay concentration combined with solute injections and bed sediment cores to characterize subsurface properties. Deposition of initially suspended clay resulted in a decrease of bedform height, celerity, and sediment flux by 14%, 22%, and 29% when 1000 g was accumulated within the bed (equal to clay/sand mass ratio of 0.4% in the bed). The hyporheic exchange flux decreased by almost a factor of 2 for all clay additions, regardless of the amount of clay eventually deposited in the bed. Post experiment sediment cores showed clay accumulation within and below the mobile layer of the bedforms, with the peak concentration occurring at the most frequent bedform scour depth. These results demonstrate the tight coupling between bed sediment morphodynamics, fine particle (clay) deposition, and hyporheic exchange. Suspended and bed load transport rates are diminished by the transfer of suspended load to the sediment via hyporheic exchange. This coupling should be considered when estimating sediment transport rates.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000582701700005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR027010%26rft.atitle%3DImpacts%2Bof%2BSuspended%2BClay%2BParticle%2BDeposition%2Bon%2BSand-Bed%2BMorphodynamics%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DDallmann%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR027010%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DDallmann%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DPhillips%252C%2BCB%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Laattoe, T",Oct 2014 ,Spatial periodicity in bed form-scale solute and thermal transport models of the hyporheic zone,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Spatially periodic solute boundaries force symmetry across a model domain by ensuring that concentrations and concentration gradients are identical at the same location on opposite boundaries. They have been used in multiple publications on a hyporheic zone model of a single ripple or dune style bed form, including variable density flow and reactive transport variants. We evaluate simulations of multibed form models without imposing spatially periodic transport to demonstrate that nonphysical solute distributions arise from the periodic solute transport assumption. That is, the flow field within the single bed form model leads to a transport scenario that violates the forced symmetry of periodic solute boundary conditions, culminating in a physically unrealistic solute distribution. Our results show that lack of symmetry between boundaries is a function of the vertical concentration gradient and two-dimensionless parameters characterizing the hyporheic and underflow flow regimes, and the solute exchange between them. We assess the error associated with the spatially periodic assumption based on an analysis of solute fluxes across the lateral bed form model boundaries. While the focus is on steady state concentration distributions, the implications for transient solute transport models are also discussed. We conclude that periodic solute transport boundary conditions should be applied only to bed form models that have minimal vertical dispersive and diffusive solute transfer. This includes gaining systems and tracers such as temperature, for which a temporally periodic flux reversal occurs across the top boundary.Key Points Assumption of solute spatial periodicity in a hyporheic zone bed form model is examined Multibed form solute and thermal models are analyzed Scenarios where the assumption of solute spatial periodicity is valid are identified 10.1002/(ISSN)1944-7973Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000344783800021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Bperiodicity%2Bin%2Bbed%2Bform-scale%2Bsolute%2Band%2Bthermal%2Btransport%2Bmodels%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DTariq%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DLaattoe%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR015361%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7899%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7886-7899%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7886%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D50%26rft.au%3DLaattoe%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DWerner%252C%2BAD%26rft.au%3DPost%252C%2BVEA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

A stream cipher with the characteristics of simple and high speed is suitable in the secure communications of IoT for its security. Some stream ciphers based on coupled map lattices (CML) were proposed. However, the original coupled map lattice shows evidence of correlation between the contiguous points. In this paper, we present an improved CML with a counter to overcome the weakness. The proposed scheme has the advantage of simplicity and suits the resource constrained IoT environment. We implement the proposed improved CML and analyze the proposed ciphers against some attacks. For the balance performance analysis, the numbers of 0 and 1 in the keystream are almost balanced, and the difference rates show that the proposed schemes have high key sensitivity. Finally, we present some experimental results of statistical random number tests for the output keystreams. Under the pass rates of the statistical test of NIST SP800-22, the proposed ciphers with improved CML, and compound CML are at least 95% and 97%, respectively.

12,"Binet, S",Jan 2017 ,"Water exchange, mixing and transient storage between a saturated karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer: Groundwater flow modeling and inputs from stable water isotopes",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Water exchanges between a karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer are driven by hydraulic head gradient at the interface between these two domains. The case-study presented in this paper investigates the impact of the geometry and interface conditions around a conduit on the spatial distribution ""of these exchanges. Isotopic (delta O-18 and D-delta), discharge and water head measurements were conducted at the resurgences of a karst system with a strong allogenic recharge component (Val d'Orleans, France), to estimate the amounts of water exchanged and the mixings between a saturated karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer. The spatio-temporal variability of the observed exchanges was explored using a 2D coupled continuum-conduit flow model under saturated conditions (Feflow (R)).The inputs from the water heads and stable water isotopes in the groundwater flow model suggest that the amounts of water flowing from the aquifer are significant if the conduit flow discharges are less than the conduit flow capacity. This condition creates a spatial distribution of exchanges from upstream where the aquifer feeds the conduit (recharge area) to downstream where the conduit reaches its maximum discharge capacity and can feed the aquifer (discharge area). In the intermediate transport zone no exchange between the two domains takes place that brings a new criterion to delineate the vulnerable zones to surface water.On average, 4% of the water comes from the local recharge, 80% is recent river water and 16% is old river water. During the November 2008 flood, both isotopic signatures and model suggest that exchanges fluctuate around this steady state, limited when the river water level increases and intensified when the river water level decreases. The existence of old water from the river suggests a transient storage at the aquifer/conduit interface that can be considered as an underground hyporheic zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

15,"Schofield, KA",Apr 2018 ,Biota Connect Aquatic Habitats throughout Freshwater Ecosystem Mosaics,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Freshwater ecosystems are linked at various spatial and temporal scales by movements of biota adapted to life in water. We review the literature on movements of aquatic organisms that connect different types of freshwater habitats, focusing on linkages from streams and wetlands to downstream waters. Here, streams, wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds, and other freshwater habitats are viewed as dynamic freshwater ecosystem mosaics (FEMs) that collectively provide the resources needed to sustain aquatic life. Based on existing evidence, it is clear that biotic linkages throughout FEMs have important consequences for biological integrity and biodiversity. All aquatic organisms move within and among FEM components, but differ in the mode, frequency, distance, and timing of their movements. These movements allow biota to recolonize habitats, avoid inbreeding, escape stressors, locate mates, and acquire resources. Cumulatively, these individual movements connect populations within and among FEMs and contribute to local and regional diversity, resilience to disturbance, and persistence of aquatic species in the face of environmental change. Thus, the biological connections established by movement of biota among streams, wetlands, and downstream waters are critical to the ecological integrity of these systems. Future research will help advance our understanding of the movements that link FEMs and their cumulative effects on downstream waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000428882400005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DBiota%2BConnect%2BAquatic%2BHabitats%2Bthroughout%2BFreshwater%2BEcosystem%2BMosaics%26rft.aufirst%3DKate%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DKA%26rft.aulast%3DSchofield%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.12634%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D399%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D372-399%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D372%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DSchofield%252C%2BKA%26rft.au%3DAlexander%252C%2BLC%26rft.au%3DPollard%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
16,"Coluccio, K",Oct 29 2019 ,A review of methods for measuring groundwater-surface water exchange in braided rivers,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Braided rivers, while uncommon internationally, are significant in terms of their unique ecosystems and as vital freshwater resources at locations where they occur. With an increasing awareness of the connected nature of surface water and groundwater, there have been many studies examining groundwater-surface water exchange in various types of waterbodies, but significantly less research has been conducted in braided rivers. Thus, there is currently limited understanding of how characteristics unique to braided rivers, such as channel shifting, expanding and narrowing margins, and a high degree of heterogeneity affect groundwater-surface water flow paths. This article provides an overview of characteristics specific to braided rivers, including a map showing the regions where braided rivers are mainly found at the global scale: Alaska, Canada, the Japanese and European Alps, the Himalayas, Russia, and New Zealand. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first map of its kind. This is followed by a review of prior studies that have investigated groundwater-surface water interactions in braided rivers and their associated aquifers. The various methods used to characterise these processes are discussed with emphasis on their effectiveness in achieving the studies' objectives and their applicability in braided rivers. We also discuss additional methods that appear promising to apply in braided river settings. The aim is to provide guidance on methodologies most suitable for future work in braided rivers. In many cases, previous studies found a multi-method approach useful to produce more robust results and compare data collected at various scales. Given the challenges of working directly in braided rivers, there is considerable scope for the increased use of remote sensing techniques. There is also opportunity for new approaches to modelling braided rivers using integrated techniques that incorporate the complex river bed terrain and geomorphology of braided rivers explicitly. We also identify a critical need to improve the conceptual understanding of hyporheic exchange in braided rivers, rates of recharge to and from braided rivers, and historical patterns of dry and low-flow periods in these rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000494262400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Breview%2Bof%2Bmethods%2Bfor%2Bmeasuring%2Bgroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bbraided%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DKatie%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DColuccio%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-23-4397-2019%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D4417%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4397-4417%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4397%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DColuccio%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DMorgan%252C%2BLK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
17,"Magliozzi, C",Jul 21 2020 ,Investigating invertebrate biodiversity around large wood: taxonomic vs functional metrics,AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Large wood is a key component of river channels that affects numerous hydrological, physical and geomorphological processes. It promotes a diversity of benthic habitats in-channel and has shown to support more abundant and diverse benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in previous ecological studies. However, the effects of large wood on the structural and functional diversities of hyporheic invertebrates are less well studied, and simultaneous examination of these diversity metrics on hyporheic and benthic compartments of the stream bed has not been conducted previously. Therefore, this study investigates the taxonomic and functional diversities of hyporheic and benthic invertebrate assemblages around natural accumulations of large wood in a British lowland river. Taxonomic and functional diversities were partitioned (into alpha, beta, and gamma diversities) and examined in reaches with and without large wood (control). We found that functional diversity is often decoupled from taxonomic diversity, demonstrating a functional redundancy of the macroinvertebrate assemblage for both hyporheic and benthic zones. Moreover, the highest functional variability at alpha-scale was observed in large wood habitats, which suggests that taxonomic diversity is enhanced by the small-scale environmental heterogeneity around large wood. To this end, this study contributes empirical evidence of functional and structural responses of invertebrates to large wood accumulation. Such information could be used to better understand the ecological implications of restoration works in lowland rivers and guide more effective management strategies.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000551106600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B69%26rft.atitle%3DInvestigating%2Binvertebrate%2Bbiodiversity%2Baround%2Blarge%2Bwood%253A%2Btaxonomic%2Bvs%2Bfunctional%2Bmetrics%26rft.aufirst%3DChiara%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DMagliozzi%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-020-00745-9%26rft.eissn%3D1420-9055%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D82%26rft.au%3DMagliozzi%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DMeyer%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DGrabowski%252C%2BRC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
18,"Sjodin, AL",Dec 1997 ,Denitrification as a component of the nitrogen budget for a large plains river,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"Nitrogen dynamics of a plains reach of the South Platte River were studied over a 12-month cycle for the purpose of quantifying denitrification rates. The working hypothesis of the study was that denitrification would be of extraordinary importance in the system because of large amounts of water exchange between the channel and an extensive subsurface alluvium consisting of gravel. Denitrification losses of nitrate were quantified through the use of a mass-balance model based on detailed hydrologic information and field quantification of the rates of nitrate accrual through surface and subsurface input of water as well as nitrification. Denitrification rates ranged between 2 and 100 mg N/m(2)/hr. Distance required to achieve 90% reduction of nitrate was as short as 6 km during mid-summer and as long as 300 km during mid-winter. On an annual basis, close to half of nitrate input to a 100-km reach was removed by denitrification (3.6 x 10(6) kg/yr). Rates of nitrate loss to denitrification (annual mean, 28 mg N/m(2)/h) and overall percent removal of nitrate by denitrification were approximately 10 times as high as rates documented for rivers in the eastern U.S. The study shows that high rates of hyporheic exchange can support extraordinary rates of denitrification.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1997YD25200005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDenitrification%2Bas%2Ba%2Bcomponent%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bnitrogen%2Bbudget%2Bfor%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bplains%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DAL%26rft.auinit%3DAL%26rft.aulast%3DSjodin%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1005884117467%26rft.epage%3D342%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D327-342%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D327%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DSjodin%252C%2BAL%26rft.au%3DLewis%252C%2BWM%26rft.au%3DSaunders%252C%2BJF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Henry, JC",Dec 2003 ,Spatial segregation of periphyton communities in a desert stream: causes and consequences for N cycling,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The goal of this research was to understand the underlying causes of patterns of distribution and abundance of N-fixing periphyton and non N-fixing periphyton in a desert stream, and to evaluate potential consequences of these patterns for stream N cycling. Sampling of periphyton communities at sandbar edges in Sycamore Creek, Arizona, revealed community differences related to direction of hydrologic exchange with the subsurface. N-fixing cyanobacteria were abundant at sandbar inwelling edges. Non N-fixing taxa predominated at outwelling edges. We evaluated several predictions of the hypothesis that this difference was attributable to differences in N availability at sandbar edges. NO3-N at outwelling edges was 3.5 times higher than at inwelling edges, consistent with past work showing microbial nitrification to characterize sandbars. Non N-fixing and N-fixing periphyton biovolume were related to NO3-N concentration at edges. Reciprocal transplants of periphyton from original edges to edges with the opposite direction of hydrologic exchange revealed significant declines in periphyton relative to controls. Experiments using NO3-N diffusing substrates revealed non N-fixing taxa to be more abundant where NO3-N was elevated. N-fixing periphyton was, in contrast, more abundant at naturally low NO3-N or unenriched sites. These results support the hypothesis that differences in N availability between inwelling and outwelling edges caused the observed pattern of periphyton distribution at sandbar edges. Last, 80% of outwelling NO3-N was removed from outflowing water by periphyton at sandbar edges. This temporary retention of available N results in a surface stream depleted of inorganic N and accentuates spatial heterogeneity of periphyton communities in this ecosystem.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000186839900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSpatial%2Bsegregation%2Bof%2Bperiphyton%2Bcommunities%2Bin%2Ba%2Bdesert%2Bstream%253A%2Bcauses%2Band%2Bconsequences%2Bfor%2BN%2Bcycling%26rft.aufirst%3DJC%26rft.auinit%3DJC%26rft.aulast%3DHenry%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1468349%26rft.epage%3D527%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D511-527%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D511%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DHenry%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DFisher%252C%2BSG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Jarvie, HP",Oct 30 2006 ,"Within-river nutrient processing in Chalk streams: The Pang and Lambourn, UK",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"This work examines baseflow nutrient concentrations and loads along two rural Chalk streams, the Pang and Lambourn. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and boron (13) concentrations in these streams were heavily influenced by point-source inputs and the effects of downstream flow accretion and dilution. Unlike B (which is chemically conservative), SRP loads were also strongly influenced by in-stream processing resulting in uptake of SRP, particularly immediately downstream of sewage effluent discharges, where rates of SRP uptake were highest. For the upper River Pang, up to 80% of SRP loads were lost within 4 km downstream of Compton sewage treatment works (STW) and on the River Lambourn up to 55% of SRP toads were lost within 1.6 km downstream of East Shefford STW. In contrast, nitrate (NO3) concentrations at sites along the Pang and Lambourn were largely controlled by groundwater inputs and plant uptake during periods of high photosynthetic activity in spring and summer and silicon (Si) by diatom uptake in April/May. There were net gains in NO3 toads along the river reaches, as a result of volumetric increases in groundwater discharge, and, compared with SRP, the role of in-stream processing of NO3 appeared low.Examination of SRP exchange by bed sediment and uptake of SRP into algal biofilms indicated that biofilms accounted for only a very small percentage of in-stream P-uptake, but that bed sediment SRP-exchanges had a more important control on baseflow SRP concentrations and loads. Point source P remediation at East Shefford STW, by removal of P from final effluent (P-stripping), resulted in 70-90% reductions in river-water SRP loads. After introduction of P-stripping at East Shefford STW, bed sediments immediately downstream of the STW switched from being net sinks to net sources of SRP. Our results show that, in the immediate aftermath of P-stripping, bed sediment SRP-release was responsible for a 30 mu g-P l(-1) rise in river-water SRP along this reach. White this increase in SRP concentration, as a result of bed sediment SRP release, is potentially ecologically significant, it is small in relation to the increase in SRP concentrations from effluent prior to P-stripping, which resulted in increases in SRP concentration of up to 500 mu g-P l(-1). There was a six-month tag between the introduction of P-stripping at East Shefford STW and bed sediment EPC0 recovering to equilibrium levels with the overlying river water (and thus negligible SRP release). Recovery of bed sediments to equilibrium levels is likely to have occurred as a result of winnowing and removal of high-EPC0 sediment and delivery of tower EPC0 sediment from upstream. Under higher/more variable flow conditions and greater rates of in-channel sediment erosion/delivery, more rapid recovery of bed sediment EPC0 levels following P-stripping might be expected.

21,"Fisher, SG",Sep 2004 ,Horizons in stream biogeochemistry: Flowpaths to progress,ECOLOGY,"Over the past 50 years, conceptual developments in stream ecology and ecosystem ecology have converged, thanks to biogeochemistry and the recognition that in situ processing on one hand and spatial translation of materials, processes, and influence along flowpaths on the other, unite to generate a holistic picture of ecosystem functioning at the landscape level. Early emphases in stream biogeochemistry involved organic carbon dynamics and whole-ecosystem budgets. These approaches were holistic but cumbersome and laborious and ignored several crucial issues, such as variation in organic matter quality. Nutrient-spiraling approaches rectified this shortcoming and provided a flowpath-specific technique for resolving the dynamics of both inorganic and organic materials and for comparing streams of different sizes and flow rates. The ability of nutrient-spiraling approaches to deal with multiple elements and fluctuating flows, including floods, remains elusive, however.There are several opportunities for stream ecology and biogeochemistry to continue cross-fertilization to the benefit of both disciplines. Chief among these is an emphasis on streams as spatially distributed heterogeneous systems, constantly shifting in shape and configuration through time. Hydrologic and material flowpaths integrate this heterogeneity as they alternately converge and diverge and perfuse the channel, hyporheic zone, riparian zone, and floodplain as they transport materials inexorably downstream. Conceptualizing streams as branched structures adds new insights to biogeochemical processing in space and raises several questions about network shape as an independent variable influencing biogeochemical dynamics such as nutrient retention efficiency. Junctions of streams emerge as potentially significant functional units when streams are viewed as networks. Ultimately, stream drainages finely dissect the land and receive water from soils in channelless upland regions which are themselves pervaded by convergent flowpaths, thus blurring the difference between streams and the landscapes they drain.Other lucrative future research opportunities are discussed including a plea for greater use of stoichiometric approaches and a consideration of geometry, disturbance, and legacies at multiple scales of space and time. We predict that future research in biogeochemistry will increasingly seek and find similarities among diverse ecosystem types by focusing on the spatially explicit flowpaths that integrate and connect them.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000224379600004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHorizons%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bbiogeochemistry%253A%2BFlowpaths%2Bto%2Bprogress%26rft.aufirst%3DSG%26rft.auinit%3DSG%26rft.aulast%3DFisher%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1890%252F03-0244%26rft.epage%3D2379%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-9658%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2369-2379%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2369%26rft.stitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D85%26rft.au%3DFisher%252C%2BSG%26rft.au%3DSponseller%252C%2BRA%26rft.au%3DHeffernan%252C%2BJB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Denitrification measurements were made on intact sediment cores using the N-2/Ar and isotope pairing techniques. We measured nitrate (NO3--N) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations in the water column at the time of core collection and evaluated rates of sediment-water exchange of dissolved oxygen (O-2) in conjunction with denitrification rate determinations. Nitrate concentrations in the tributary streams and river water varied over an order or magnitude, from about 10 to 110 mu mol/L, while NH4+-N concentrations were lower, varying from 0.6 to 10.8 mu mol/L. Sediments consistently consumed dissolved O-2, with rates varying from 256 to 1418 mu mol m(-2) h(-1). Most cores actively denitrified with rates ranging to 222 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1). On average, coupled nitrification-denitritication accounted for 66% of total denitrification. Lowest rates of denitrification were generally observed during December, when the water temperature was lowest at 4 degrees C. No other relationship was identified between rates of denitrification and measured physicochemical variables within or among sites or dates as sampling frequency and replication were low. Our study suggests that denitrification represents a sink of about 5% for the NO3--N load to the mainstem Neuse River and tributary streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000257061500007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDenitrification%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bmainstem%2BNeuse%2BRiver%2Band%2Btributaries%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DSC%26rft.aulast%3DWhalen%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F1863-9135%252F2008%252F0171-0249%26rft.epage%3D261%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D249-261%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D249%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D171%26rft.au%3DWhalen%252C%2BSC%26rft.au%3DAlperin%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DFischer%252C%2BEN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Traditional viewers engaged with a single-dimensional focal object, but nowadays, viewers interact with multidimensional and multiobjects through the social exchanges (e.g. virtual gifts, emotional supports) in live streaming digital communities. This study aims to address this void in the marketing literature of hardcore viewer engagement under dynamic social exchanges in digital live streaming communities. Design/methodology/approach This research used a qualitative approach. The data collections were from October 2018 to January 2020. Data were collected in semistructured interviews with 17 Media 21 hardcore viewers. Findings The outcomes of hardcore viewer engagement and social exchange include three main stages: introduction, immersion and enthusiasm. It indicates that loyalty and active hardcore viewer-streamer relationships were fostered through the process of hardcore viewer engagement and social exchange with multiple objects and dimensions. Research limitations/implications There are three main implications to the literature in this study. First, this empirical study extends the concept of consumer engagement to hardcore viewer engagement, and social exchange is found to trigger social behavior and relations in a digital live streaming community. Second, it contributes to the social media community literature. Hardcore viewer engagement provides a broad dimensional scope to examine digital live streaming community participation by integrating the cognitive, affective and behavioral aspects. Finally, it contributes to the literature of social exchange theory. It indicates that the extension of hardcore viewer-streamer social relationships is not restricted to traditional mass media but can be fostered in digital live streaming communities. Practical implications It contributes to the consumer engagement literature by exploring in depth viewer engagement dimensionality in a rich digital live streaming context. This study proposed a framework for understanding the stages and outcomes of viewer engagement and parasocial interactions according to three dimensions and multiple objects, which lacked empirical validation in previous studies. Social implications This study also contributes to the social media community literature. In capturing the functions of such groups, the variables of interest were ""participation,"" ""involvement"" and ""membership."" These variables were determined through behavioral actions or intentions. In contrast, viewer engagement provided a broad dimensional scope to examine digital live streaming community participation by integrating the cognitive, affective and behavioral aspects. Originality/value The findings of this study indicate that the extension of parasocial relationships is not restricted to traditional mass media but can be fostered in digital live streaming communities that are designed to bring the viewer close to streamer(s), community members and system functions and activities.Although digital live streaming applications differ from traditional parasocial interaction environments because they offer direct, instantaneous, multiple communication among streamer(s), system functions and community members, the findings of the present study indicate that viewer-streamer-viewer parasocial relationships established both online and offline are often interwoven.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000869345200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHardcore%2Bviewer%2Bengagement%2Band%2Bsocial%2Bexchange%2Bwith%2Bstreamers%2Band%2Btheir%2Bdigital%2Blive%2Bstreaming%2Bcommunities%26rft.aufirst%3DChih-Ping%26rft.auinit%3DCP%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1108%252FQMR-06-2021-0074%26rft.eissn%3D1758-7646%26rft.epage%3D57%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1352-2752%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DQUALITATIVE%2BMARKET%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D37-57%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D37%26rft.stitle%3DQUAL%2BMARK%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D26&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=QUALITATIVE+MARKET+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

We use the model to partition the relative influences of redd topography versus altered hydraulic Conductivity (winnowing of fines during spawning) oil egg pocket conditions for a simulated pool-riffle channel with a redd placed at the pool tail. Predictions show that altered hydraulic conductivity is the primary factor for enhancing hyporheic velocities and dissolved oxygen content within the egg pocket. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that redds induce hyporheic Circulation that is nested within that caused by pool-riffle topography and that spawning-related changes in hyporheic velocities and dissolved oxygen content Could create conditions Suitable for incubation in locations that otherwise Would be unfavorable (reinforcing the notion that salmonids actively modify their environment in ways that may be beneficial to their progeny).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000273419200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bthree-dimensional%2Bmodel%2Bfor%2Banalyzing%2Bthe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bsalmon%2Bredds%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Begg%2Bpocket%2Bhabitat%26rft.aufirst%3DDaniele%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DTonina%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252FF09-146%26rft.eissn%3D1205-7533%26rft.epage%3D2173%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2157-2173%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2157%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D66%26rft.au%3DTonina%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DBuffington%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
26,"Thomle, J",Nov 2020 ,A Flux Detection Probe to Quantify Dynamic Groundwater-Surface Water Exchange in the Hyporheic Zone,GROUNDWATER,"A new probe was designed to quantify groundwater-surface water exchange in the hyporheic zone under dynamic stage condition. Current methods focus on either vertical pore water velocity or Darcy flux measurements. Both parameters must be understood to evaluate residence time and mass flux of constituents. Furthermore, most instruments are not well suited for monitoring instantaneous velocity or flux under dynamic exchange conditions. For this reason, the flux detection probe (FDP) was designed that employs electrogeophysical measurements to estimate in situ sediment porosity, which can be used to convert pore water velocity to Darcy flux. Dynamic pore water velocity is obtained by monitoring fluid conductivity and temperature along the FDP probe. Pressure sensors deployed at the top and bottom of the probe provide the additional information necessary to estimate vertical permeability. This study focuses on the use of a geophysical method to estimate pore water velocity, porosity, and permeability within a controlled soil column where simulated river water displaces simulated groundwater. The difference between probe derived and theoretical pore water velocity using natural tracers such as electrical conductivity and temperature was -4.9 and 3.9% for downward flow and 1.1 and 12.8% for upward flow, respectively. The difference in porosity calculated from mass and volume packed in the soil column and probe measure porosity ranged between -3.2% and 1.5%. Also, the calculated hydraulic conductivity differed from probe derived values by -8.9%.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000525918700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BFlux%2BDetection%2BProbe%2Bto%2BQuantify%2BDynamic%2BGroundwater-Surface%2BWater%2BExchange%2Bin%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DJonathan%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DThomle%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.13001%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D900%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D892-900%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D892%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DThomle%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DStrickland%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DStegen%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
27,"Wang, SJ",Jan 2022 ,The coupling relationship between urbanization and ecological resilience in the Pearl River Delta,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,"Urban resilience is an emerging research topic of urban studies, and its essence is described by the ability of cities to resist, recover, and adapt to uncertain disturbances. This paper constructs a ""Size-Density-Morphology"" urban ecological resilience evaluation system, uses a coupling coordination degree model to measure the degree of coupling coordination between urbanization and ecological resilience in the Pearl River Delta from 2000 to 2015, and conducts an in-depth discussion on its spatiotemporal characteristics. The results show the following. (1) From 2000 to 2015, the urbanization level of cities in the study area generally increased while the level of ecological resilience declined. The coupling coordination degree between the two systems decreased from basic coordination to basic imbalance. (2) In terms of spatial distribution, the coupling coordination degree between urbanization and ecological resilience of cities presented a circular pattern that centered on the cities at the estuary of the Pearl River and increased toward the periphery. (3) Ecological resilience sub-systems played variable roles in the coupling coordination between urbanization and ecological resilience. Specifically, size resilience mainly played a reverse blocking role; the influence of morphology resilience was generally positive and continued to increase over time; the effect of density resilience was positive and continued to decline and further became negative after falling below zero. The main pathways for achieving coordinated and sustainable development of future urbanization and ecological resilience in the Pearl River Delta include: leading the coordinated development of regions with new urbanization, improving ecological resilience by strictly observing the three areas and three lines, adapting to ecological carrying capacity, and rationally arranging urban green spaces.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000739955400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bcoupling%2Brelationship%2Bbetween%2Burbanization%2Band%2Becological%2Bresilience%2Bin%2Bthe%2BPearl%2BRiver%2BDelta%26rft.aufirst%3DShaojian%26rft.auinit%3DSJ%26rft.aulast%3DWang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11442-022-1935-3%26rft.eissn%3D1861-9568%26rft.epage%3D64%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1009-637X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOGRAPHICAL%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D44-64%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D44%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOGR%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BSJ%26rft.au%3DCui%252C%2BZT%26rft.au%3DSu%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOGRAPHICAL+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The study revealed extensive buried sand channels composed of coarse sand with gravel and fine sand. The average thickness of coarse sand with gravel aquifer horizon was about 90 m and has been identified at a depth between 10 and 100 m. The fine sand horizon was observed beyond a depth of about 45 m. These sand bodies are extended laterally for a distance of about 12 km in the northeast to southwest direction connecting the Markanda river and the Vedic Saraswati river. The transverse resistance values of these buried channels (7392-7585 Omega m(2) for coarse sand with gravel, and 384-2856 Omega m(2) for fine sand) indicate good groundwater potential. The age of these buried sand bodies belongs to the Late Harappan period, as evident from different archaeological sites found in and around the survey area. Thus, the present study reveals that once the Markanda basin was a part of the Vedic Saraswati river system, and one of the headwaters of the once celebrated Vedic Saraswati river can be identified as the present Markanda river.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000292455700031,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEstablishment%2Bof%2Bmissing%2Bstream%2Blink%2Bbetween%2Bthe%2BMarkanda%2Briver%2Band%2Bthe%2BVedic%2BSaraswati%2Briver%2Bin%2BHaryana%252C%2BIndia%2B-%2Bgeoelectrical%2Bresistivity%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DK.%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DKS%26rft.aulast%3DKshetrimayum%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft.epage%3D1724%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0011-3891%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DCURRENT%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1719-1724%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1719%26rft.stitle%3DCURR%2BSCI%2BINDIA%26rft.volume%3D100%26rft.au%3DKshetrimayum%252C%2BKS%26rft.au%3DBajpai%252C%2BVN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=CURRENT+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
29,"Ikard, SJ",Jun 2018 ,New Insights on Scale-dependent Surface-Groundwater Exchange from a Floating Self-potential Dipole,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING GEOPHYSICS,"In south-central Texas the lower Guadalupe River has incised into the outcrop of the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer. The river and the aquifer are hydraulically connected across the outcrop, although the connectivity is obscured at the surface by alluvium and surface-water and groundwater exchange dynamics are currently poorly understood. To investigate surface-water and groundwater exchange dynamics between the lower Guadalupe River and the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer, a geophysical study was completed along a 14.86 km reach of the river by using water-borne gradient self-potential (SP) profiling and two-dimensional direct-current electric resistivity tomography. This paper explores the applicability of these water-borne geoelectric methods in delineating gaining and losing channel reaches, and demonstrates that geoelectric signals in the form of total electric field strength can be logged with an electric dipole and decomposed into component SP signals depicting regional and local groundwater flow patterns attributable to regional and localized hydraulic gradients. Localized SP anomalies of several tens of millivolts, indicative of hyporheic exchange flows, are observed and superimposed upon a 124 mV regional SP anomaly indicative of ambient groundwater exchange flows between the river and the aquifer. The observed SP signals are interpreted through two-dimensional finite-element modeling of streaming potentials attributable to ambient groundwater exchange and hyporheic exchange flow patterns. Variables of the channel environment such as temperature and concentration gradients, depth, and velocity are considered and subsequently eliminated as alternative sources of the SP signals that are presented.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000434100800010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNew%2BInsights%2Bon%2BScale-dependent%2BSurface-Groundwater%2BExchange%2Bfrom%2Ba%2BFloating%2BSelf-potential%2BDipole%26rft.aufirst%3DScott%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DSJ%26rft.aulast%3DIkard%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2113%252FJEEG23.2.261%26rft.eissn%3D1943-2658%26rft.epage%3D287%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1083-1363%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BAND%2BENGINEERING%2BGEOPHYSICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D261-287%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D261%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BENVIRON%2BENG%2BGEOPH%26rft.volume%3D23%26rft.au%3DIkard%252C%2BSJ%26rft.au%3DTeeple%252C%2BAP%26rft.au%3DBanta%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+AND+ENGINEERING+GEOPHYSICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

31,"Choi, J",Aug 1998 ,Modeling CO2 degassing and pH in a stream-aquifer system,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Final Creek, Arizona receives an inflow of ground water with high dissolved inorganic carbon (57-75 mg/l) and low pH (5.8-6.3). There is an observed increase of in-stream pH from approximately 6.0-7.8 over the 3 km downstream of the point of groundwater inflow. We hypothesized that CO2 gas-exchange was the most important factor causing the pH increase in this stream-aquifer system. An existing transport model, for coupled ground water-surface water systems (OTIS), was modified to include carbonate equilibria and CO2 degassing, used to simulate alkalinity, total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T), and pH in Pinal Creek. Because of the non-linear relation between pH and Cn the modified transport model used the numerical iteration method to solve the non-linearity. The transport model parameters were determined by the injection of two tracers, bromide and propane. The resulting simulations of alkalinity, C-T and pH reproduced, without fitting, the overall trends in downstream concentrations. A multi-parametric sensitivity analysis (MPSA) was used to identify the relative sensitivities of the predictions to six of the physical and chemical parameters used in the transport model. MPSA results implied that C-T and pH in stream water were controlled by the mixing of ground water with stream water and CO2 degassing. The relative importance of these two processes varied spatially depending on the hydrologic conditions, such as stream flow velocity and whether a reach gained or lost stream water caused by the interaction with the ground water. The coupled transport model with CO2 degassing and generalized sensitivity analysis presented in this study can be applied to evaluate carbon transport and pH in other coupled stream-ground water systems.

32,"Xu, JX",Aug 2016 ,"Sediment jamming of a trunk stream by hyperconcentrated floods from small tributaries: case of the Upper Yellow River, China",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,"The tributary-trunk stream relationship is investigated with respect to hyperconcentrated flows and coupled wind-water processes in the Yellow River, China. Ten small tributaries that drain only 3% of the total drainage area of the trunk stream transport large amounts of relatively coarse sediment from the desert to the trunk stream during hyperconcentrated floods. The resultant strong sedimentation often jams the trunk stream, leading to serious disasters. This study reveals the cause of this interesting phenomenon and proposes countermeasures for disaster reduction. A typical sediment-jamming event (SJE) in July 1989 was thoroughly analysed based on the observational data, including the beginning, development and final stages of the event. An index of the geomorphologic effectiveness of the tributary on the trunk stream and a number of indices describing SJEs and the influencing factors are adopted, based on which a discrimination relationship for the occurrence of SJEs is established and some statistical relationships are also established. The SJE's hydrological and geomorphologic impacts are discussed at short timescales (from several days to one month) and at long time scales (up to 46years). The results may help to gain a new insight into the study of the tributary-trunk stream relationship, and provide useful information for sediment management and disaster-reduction planning in the drainage basin. Countermeasures are suggested to reduce the channel sedimentation and the risk of sediment-jamming disaters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000380065500013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSediment%2Bjamming%2Bof%2Ba%2Btrunk%2Bstream%2Bby%2Bhyperconcentrated%2Bfloods%2Bfrom%2Bsmall%2Btributaries%253A%2Bcase%2Bof%2Bthe%2BUpper%2BYellow%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DJiongxin%26rft.auinit%3DJX%26rft.aulast%3DXu%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F02626667.2015.1055272%26rft.eissn%3D2150-3435%26rft.epage%3D1940%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0262-6667%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BSCIENCES%2BJOURNAL-JOURNAL%2BDES%2BSCIENCES%2BHYDROLOGIQUES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1926-1940%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1926%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROLOG%2BSCI%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D61&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+SCIENCES+JOURNAL-JOURNAL+DES+SCIENCES+HYDROLOGIQUES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
33,"Zhang, ZY",Aug 2021 ,Effects of Heterogeneous Stream-Groundwater Exchange on the Source Composition of Stream Discharge and Solute Load,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The exchange of water and solutes between the stream and groundwater along a stream network affects the source composition of discharge and solute load in the stream. To date, this hydrologic turnover has only been analyzed with respect to the exchange of water. In this study, we extend the concept of hydrologic turnover to solutes and analyze the effects of different hydrologic conditions on the spatial patterns and magnitude of exchange fluxes. Based on a coupled stream-groundwater model built in MODFLOW using the Streamflow-routing package, we simulated stream-groundwater exchange along a stream of 30 km in length and evaluated the evolution of stream water source composition under different precipitation and streamflow conditions. Results show that even for highly variable hydrologic conditions, the direction of stream-groundwater exchange (loss/gain) remained unchanged in consistently gaining or losing reaches, but changed in interspersed transitional reaches. The comparison between the source composition of discharge and nitrate load in stream water revealed a decoupling of discharge and solute load contribution from groundwater to the stream, as zones of high water gains do not necessarily coincide with zones of high solute concentrations. Overall, nearly 80% of total groundwater contributions to the outflow of water from the catchment were generated over only 20% of the total stream length. Our research highlights the importance of distinguishing water and solute load contributions to streams. This in turn implies that to reduce groundwater-borne nutrient loads to streams, measures need to focus on the specific reaches with highest load contributions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000688205400056,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR029079%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2BHeterogeneous%2BStream-Groundwater%2BExchange%2Bon%2Bthe%2BSource%2BComposition%2Bof%2BStream%2BDischarge%2Band%2BSolute%2BLoad%26rft.aufirst%3DZhi-Yuan%26rft.auinit%3DZY%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR029079%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BZY%26rft.au%3DSchmidt%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DFleckenstein%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
34,"Wagner, FH",2002 ,"Interstitial flow through preferential flow paths in the hyporheic zone of the Oberer Seebach, Austria",AQUATIC SCIENCES,"We investigated interstitial flow velocities in the Oberer Seebach, Austria, with NaCl tracer injections at a sediment depth of 30 cm to estimate the hydraulic conditions experienced by invertebrates inhabiting the hyporheic zone. Flow velocity measured with tracers is taken as travel time of the water along a straight line between injection and sampling points, although the water flows around sediment particles, and thus travels a somewhat longer distance. From sections of stream sediment in which the interstitial spaces were replaced by concrete, we estimated that this difference amounts, on average, to 27% and used this factor to correct the results of our velocity measurements. Corrected interstitial water velocities ranged from 0.01 to 1.32 cm s(-1) and were independent of surface discharge. We also studied spatial patterns in the bed sediments with long-term tracer injections. The three-dimensional distribution of tracer concentrations 24 hours after the start of the injection indicated that interstitial water preferentially flows in a complex network of areas of high hydraulic connectivity. Reynolds numbers for flow in the hyporheic pore space ranged from 0.1 to 489, implying that the flow environment varies from laminar up to the zone of transition to turbulent flow. Therefore, invertebrates may have a size-related active choice of areas where either friction drag or pressure drag predominates. The consequence of flow patterns, such as those observed in our study, is that small-scale variability of hydraulic conditions may be an important determinant of the patchy invertebrate distribution in bed sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000179471200008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInterstitial%2Bflow%2Bthrough%2Bpreferential%2Bflow%2Bpaths%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bthe%2BOberer%2BSeebach%252C%2BAustria%26rft.aufirst%3DFH%26rft.auinit%3DFH%26rft.aulast%3DWagner%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00027-002-8075-8%26rft.epage%3D316%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1015-1621%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D307-316%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D307%26rft.stitle%3DAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D64%26rft.au%3DWagner%252C%2BFH%26rft.au%3DBretschko%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
35,"Duff, JH",Sep 1998 ,A mini drivepoint sampler for measuring pore water solute concentrations in the hyporheic zone of sand-bottom streams,LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"A new method for collecting pore-water samples in sand and gravel streambeds is presented. We developed a mini drivepoint solution sampling (MINIPOINT) technique to collect pore-water samples at 2.5-cm vertical resolution. The sampler consisted of six small-diameter stainless steel drivepoints arranged in a 10-cm-diameter circular array. In a simple procedure, the sampler was installed in the streambed to preset drivepoint depths of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, and 15.0 cm. Sampler performance was evaluated in the Shingobee River, Minnesota, and Final Creek, Arizona, by measuring the vertical gradient of chloride concentration in pore water beneath the streambed that was established by the uninterrupted injection to the stream for 3 d. Pore-water samples were withdrawn from all drivepoints simultaneously. In the first evaluation, the vertical chloride gradient was unchanged at withdrawal rates between 0.3 and 4.0 ml min(-1) but was disturbed at higher rates. In the second evaluation, up to 70 ml of pore water was withdrawn from each drivepoint at a withdrawal rate of 2.5 ml min(-1) without disturbing the vertical chloride gradient. Background concentrations of other solutes were also determined with MINIPOINT sampling. Steep vertical gradients were present for biologically reactive solutes such as DO, NH4+, NO3-, and dissolved organic C in the top 20 cm of the streambed. These detailed solute profiles in the hyporheic zone could not have been determined without a method for close interval vertical sampling that does not disturb natural hydrologic mixing between stream water and groundwater.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000076791700032,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bmini%2Bdrivepoint%2Bsampler%2Bfor%2Bmeasuring%2Bpore%2Bwater%2Bsolute%2Bconcentrations%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Bsand-bottom%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJH%26rft.auinit%3DJH%26rft.aulast%3DDuff%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.1998.43.6.1378%26rft.epage%3D1383%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1378-1383%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1378%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DDuff%252C%2BJH%26rft.au%3DMurphy%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DJackman%252C%2BAP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Studies of the seawater exchange capacities of harbors are viewed as an important index and means of protecting coastal water environments. In this paper, the MIKE21 hydrodynamic model (HD) is established and coupled with the transport model (TR) and particle tracking model (PT). Taking the Budai Harbor of Chiayi County along the southwestern coast of Taiwan as an example, five scenarios of upstream river inflow and corresponding pollutant distributions are explored. The tidal exchange rates (TER) of the five scenarios are quantitatively calculated. The results show the following: (1) Water exchange and self-purification capacities of the coastal area are stronger than those of other areas of the wetland region. (2) The self-purification capacities of the wetland are improved close to estuary due to upstream inflows. (3) With an increase in upstream flows, the wetland TER increases from 0.85 to 0.95, showing that inflows improve the water exchange capacity of the wetland. These have results applications for quantifying the influence of engineering construction in coastal areas close to harbors, for revealing the rates of seawater exchange that govern areas within and outside of harbors.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000629588400002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B33%26rft.atitle%3DSeawater%2Bexchange%2Brates%2Bfor%2Bharbors%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bthe%2Buse%2Bof%2BMIKE21%2Bcoupled%2Bwith%2Btransport%2Band%2Bparticle%2Btracking%2Bmodels%26rft.aufirst%3DTao%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DBai%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11852-021-00815-6%26rft.eissn%3D1874-7841%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1400-0350%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BCOASTAL%2BCONSERVATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BCOAST%2BCONSERV%26rft.volume%3D25%26rft.au%3DBai%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DChang%252C%2BCM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+COASTAL+CONSERVATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
37,"Song, XH",Jul 2021 ,Scale-dependent spatial variabilities of hydrological exchange flows and transit time in a large regulated river,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hydrological exchange flows (HEFs) across the river-aquifer interface and the associated transit time of river water in the aquifer have important implications for contaminant plume migration and biogeochemical processes in the river corridor. HEFs and transit time are influenced by both subsurface physical features and hydrologic forcing related to the transport process, which can exhibit complex spatial and temporal variations. In this study, we used a massively parallel subsurface flow model and a particle-tracking model to study the influences of different control factors on spatial variability of HEFs and transit time distributions in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington State. 100 million particles were randomly injected in time and space and then tracked in a model domain that covers a 51-km(2) area (15.1million model cells). We used hourly river stages and groundwater levels to drive the model to provide dynamic velocity fields for the particle tracking in the two + -year simulation period. The groundwater flow simulation and particle-tracking results provide a comprehensive assessment of the spatial distribution of HEFs and transit time in a large, complex river corridor. Our results show that the aquifer hydrogeological structure has strong correlations with the extent and magnitude of exchange flux. The transit time exhibits complex patterns that are affected by all the river geomorphologic, hydrodynamic, and hydrogeologic factors and are strongly correlated with the downwelling ratio of exchange flux. The new insights gained through this study can be used to support the development of reduced-order models of HEFs and transit time distributions for large complex river systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000661813200108,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B126283%26rft.atitle%3DScale-dependent%2Bspatial%2Bvariabilities%2Bof%2Bhydrological%2Bexchange%2Bflows%2Band%2Btransit%2Btime%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bregulated%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DXuehang%26rft.auinit%3DXH%26rft.aulast%3DSong%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2021.126283%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D598%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BXH%26rft.au%3DFang%252C%2BYL%26rft.au%3DScheibe%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

The study was performed at five sites of Oder. Two sites were localized in the main channel of Oder (East Oder), other sites were localized in the west arm of Oder and at the beginning of the canal carrying the post-cooling water from the power plant, and the last site was below at the shallow channel joining the Western Oder with the Eastern Oder. At the channel site in which the two arms of the river are connected a significantly higher taxa number, abundance and biomass of crustaceans was observed than at the other sites. The taxonomic similarity index between all sites was at a rather low level. The Pearson's coefficient, multiple regression analysis and CCA showed that temperature, conductivity and content of nitrates had the strongest impact on the abundance of zooplankton. Thus, in lower, slowly flowing section of River Oder the physico-chemical variables influenced zooplankton density.

39,"Timbadiya, PV",Feb 2015 ,A 1D-2D Coupled Hydrodynamic Model for River Flood Prediction in a Coastal Urban Floodplain,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"In this work, a one dimensional-two dimensional (1D-2D) coupled hydrodynamic model is developed for prediction of water levels in the lower Tapi River and its coastal urban floodplain (Surat city in Gujarat, India). A one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic model, calibrated for the 1998 flood, is coupled with a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model of an urban floodplain with due consideration of the upstream (releases from Ukai reservoir) and downstream (tidal level of the sea) boundary conditions. The resistance coefficient for the floodplain is estimated using satellite imagery based on the land use and land cover pattern. The coupled hydrodynamic model is validated with independent data for flooding in the year 2006 and is used to develop a stage-discharge curve along the lower Tapi River for computation of the stream power during the flood. The methodology for river flood prediction on a coastal urban floodplain using the 1D-2D coupled hydrodynamic model is generic and can be applied to similar geographical conditions.

40,"Preziosi-Ribero, A",Feb 2020 ,Fine Sediment Deposition and Filtration Under Losing and Gaining Flow Conditions: A Particle Tracking Model Approach,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Fine particle deposition within riverbeds plays a major role in riverine ecology and biogeochemistry by altering hyporheic exchange flux. Moreover, it is ubiquitous within streams and rivers across all flow stages. However, the dynamics of fine particle deposition are still not completely understood in rivers, and continuum models like the advection dispersion equation require modifications to represent the processes accurately. To enhance understanding of fine particle dynamics, we developed a novel numerical particle tracking model that simulates fine particle deposition as a stochastic process under losing, neutral, and gaining streamflow conditions. These flow conditions generate three different velocity profiles by combining the free surface and groundwater flows. In addition, a novel aspect of our model is the storage of filtered particles to estimate concentration fields within the bed. Our simulated results are qualitatively compared with previous laboratory flume experimental results of kaolinite deposition under similar conditions. The model indicates that fine particle deposition patterns and residence time functions depend heavily on the exchange flux between stream and groundwater, as well as bed filtration properties as the deposition of particles occurs at greater depths in the losing stream condition than in the neutral and gaining cases. Therefore, the spatial pattern of particle deposition is a direct result of pore water velocity profiles, while the concentration depends on filtration dynamics within the bed.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000535672800029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR026057%26rft.atitle%3DFine%2BSediment%2BDeposition%2Band%2BFiltration%2BUnder%2BLosing%2Band%2BGaining%2BFlow%2BConditions%253A%2BA%2BParticle%2BTracking%2BModel%2BApproach%26rft.aufirst%3DAntonio%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DPreziosi-Ribero%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR026057%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DPreziosi-Ribero%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DArnon%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Saeedpanah, I",Feb 2019 ,Solution of Unsteady Flow in a Confined Aquifer Interacting with a Stream with Exponentially Decreasing Stream Stage,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The solution of interactions between groundwater and surface water provides good insight into the mechanism of these water resources. Considering groundwater as a significant source of irrigation and a main freshwater supply for agricultural purposes, a stream-aquifer system is studied to investigate the groundwater level and flow direction. The solution is obtained and applicable for streams fully penetrating the aquifer. The system is solved and a set of expressions for computing level and exchange in the aquifer are derived by means of the Laplace transformation technique, wherein the right end of the aquifer is a constant head boundary and the stream stage at the left boundary decreases exponentially with time. A broad range of sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of variations in aquifer parameters on groundwater head. Aquifer response for exponential and sudden drops in stream stage is investigated. A useful expression describing the relation of stream stage variation rate and volumetric exchange is found, which clarifies whether the final volumetric exchange is negative, zero, or positive. For a sudden drop in stream stage, a water divide takes place in the aquifer and therefore flow reversal occurs at the water divide position. It is shown that how and how much the position of the water divide changes depends on changes in aquifer parameters. In addition, it is observed that groundwater level stabilization occurs relatively faster in aquifers with a greater hydraulic conductivity, smaller specific storage, or smaller length.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000453215200011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B04018066%26rft.atitle%3DSolution%2Bof%2BUnsteady%2BFlow%2Bin%2Ba%2BConfined%2BAquifer%2BInteracting%2Bwith%2Ba%2BStream%2Bwith%2BExponentially%2BDecreasing%2BStream%2BStage%26rft.aufirst%3DIraj%26rft.auinit%3DI%26rft.aulast%3DSaeedpanah%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1061%252F%2528ASCE%2529HE.1943-5584.0001758%26rft.eissn%3D1943-5584%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1084-0699%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGIC%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DSaeedpanah%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DAzar%252C%2BRG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGIC+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Malard, F",Apr 2003 ,Influence of groundwater upwelling on the distribution of the hyporheos in a headwater river flood plain,ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE,"We examined the influence of groundwater upwelling on the distribution of the hyporheic fauna in a 2.6-km long glacial flood plain, the downstream part of which behaved as a major groundwater upwelling zone. Hyporheic water and invertebrates were collected during the four different phases of the expansion-contraction cycle at a depth of 30cm in the bed sediment of 28 channels. Multivariate methods and analysis of variance were used to test for differences in the concentration of nutrients and composition of the hyporheos between the upstream and downstream parts of the flood plain. The large scale groundwater upwelling flow pattern maintained permanent flow conditions in the lower flood plain but had no detectable influence on temperature and nutrient concentrations of shallow hyporheic water. In contrast, the density and taxonomic richness of hyporheic assemblages were distinctly higher in the upwelling zone, essentially because of an increase in the number and density of taxa belonging to the permanent hyporheos and true groundwater fauna. The longitudinal pattern of hyporheic assemblages remained remarkably stable over the four different phases of the expansion-contraction cycle. We concluded that the strength of hydrological connections between ground water and surface water had a major influence on hyporheic biodiversity by controlling not only the degree of flow permanency but also the recolonization pathways of organisms inhabiting streambed sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000183318300005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%2Bupwelling%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bdistribution%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheos%2Bin%2Ba%2Bheadwater%2Briver%2Bflood%2Bplain%26rft.aufirst%3DF%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DMalard%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F0003-9136%252F2003%252F0157-0089%26rft.epage%3D116%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0003-9136%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DARCHIV%2BFUR%2BHYDROBIOLOGIE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D89-116%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D89%26rft.stitle%3DARCH%2BHYDROBIOL%26rft.volume%3D157%26rft.au%3DMalard%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DFerreira%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BJV&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=ARCHIV+FUR+HYDROBIOLOGIE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Leveraging the TextFlow-like visual metaphor, SurfRiver untangles the convoluted individual stream surfaces along the flow direction and maps them along the horizontal direction of the abstract river view. It stacks multiple surfaces along the vertical direction of the river view. This visual mapping makes it easy for users to track along the flow direction and align stream surfaces for comparative study. Through brushing and linking, the river view is connected to the spatial surface view for collective reasoning. SurfRiver can be used to examine a single stream surface, investigate seeding sensitivity or variability of a family of surfaces from a group of related seeding curves, or explore a collection of representative surfaces. We describe our optimization solution to achieve the desirable mapping, present SurfRiver interface and interactions, and report results from different flow fields to demonstrate its efficacy.

45,"Rudorff, CM",Jan 2018 ,Recent increase of river-floodplain suspended sediment exchange in a reach of the lower Amazon River,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"We analyzed variation of channel-floodplain suspended sediment exchange along a 140km reach of the lower Amazon River for two decades (1995-2014). Daily sediment fluxes were determined by combining measured and estimated surface sediment concentrations with river-floodplain water exchanges computed with a two-dimensional hydraulic model. The average annual inflow to the floodplain was 4088 +/- 2017 Gg yr(-1) and the outflow was 2251 +/- 471 Gg yr(-1), respectively. Prediction of average sediment accretion rate was twice the estimate from a previous study of this same reach and more than an order of magnitude lower than an estimate from an earlier regional scale study. The amount of water routed through the floodplain, which is sensitive to levee topography and increases exponentially with river discharge, was the main factor controlling the variation in total annual sediment inflow. Besides floodplain routing, the total annual sediment export depended on the increase in sediment concentration in lakes during floodplain drainage. The recent increasing amplitude of the Amazon River annual flood over two decades has caused a substantial shift in water and sediment river-floodplain exchanges. In the second decade (2005-2014), as the frequency of extreme floods increased, annual sediment inflow increased by 81% and net storage increased by 317% in relation to the previous decade (1995-2004).

47,"Sheshjavani, AG",Mar 2017 ,An adaptive buffer-map exchange mechanism for pull-based peer-to-peer video-on-demand streaming systems,MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS,"Unlike P2P live video streaming in which all the peers in a channel watch a video with tiny differences in viewing points, in P2P video on demand (VoD) streaming systems, neighbor peers may watch the same video with more different viewing points; therefore, using push-based approach is not efficient for such systems, and the overhead of the pull-based approaches is challenging due to the periodical exchange of buffer-maps among the peers. In pull-based P2P VoD systems, to achieve better quality of experience it is necessary to use large buffers at the peers that results in more buffer-maps exchange overhead. In this paper, we study buffer-map exchange challenging in pull-based P2P VoD streaming systems and propose an adaptive mechanism for decreasing overhead by sending the buffer-maps with regard to the viewing points of the peers. Bandwidth overhead of the proposed mechanism is independent of the used buffer sizes and is less dependent to the buffer-map exchange period. By using this effective mechanism, better quality of service can be achieved through using large buffers at the peers, without increasing in the overhead. Our simulation based performance evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in decreasing the bandwidth overhead of buffer-map exchange in P2P VoD streaming systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000397278400064,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2Badaptive%2Bbuffer-map%2Bexchange%2Bmechanism%2Bfor%2Bpull-based%2Bpeer-to-peer%2Bvideo-on-demand%2Bstreaming%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DAbdollah%2BGhaffari%26rft.auinit%3DAG%26rft.aulast%3DSheshjavani%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11042-016-3425-z%26rft.eissn%3D1573-7721%26rft.epage%3D7561%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1380-7501%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DMULTIMEDIA%2BTOOLS%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7535-7561%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7535%26rft.stitle%3DMULTIMED%2BTOOLS%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D76%26rft.au%3DSheshjavani%252C%2BAG%26rft.au%3DAkbari%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=MULTIMEDIA+TOOLS+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Jones, NE",Aug 2010 ,Incorporating lakes within the river discontinuum: longitudinal changes in ecological characteristics in stream-lake networks,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES,"Lakes and rivers are intimately connected in an alternating series of lentic and lotic reaches in many regions. The study of lakes and their outlets in hierarchical and branching river networks has not gained the attention of stream ecologists, and little effort has been focused on synthesizing the ecology of lake-stream interactions within a drainage network. Rapid and predictable changes in the ecological characteristics of streams occur at the interface with lakes. The influence that a lake might have on a stream is dependent on its position within the stream, stream type and size, lake size and shape, and the inlet and outlet positions. Little is known about the influences of multiple lakes within stream-lake networks and how these influences are determined by network shape and pattern. Fruitful collaborations and novel insights will come from the combined efforts of limnologists, stream ecologists, and landscape ecologists. Geographic information systems and network analyses will play an important role in summarizing aquatic landscape characteristics and creating a predictive science of aquatic networks. Lakes need to be more explicitly incorporated into ecological concepts in stream ecology, and reciprocally, streams need to be incorporated into ecological concepts involving lakes for the successful management and conservation of our aquatic resources.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000281208400012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DIncorporating%2Blakes%2Bwithin%2Bthe%2Briver%2Bdiscontinuum%253A%2Blongitudinal%2Bchanges%2Bin%2Becological%2Bcharacteristics%2Bin%2Bstream-lake%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DNicholas%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DNE%26rft.aulast%3DJones%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252FF10-069%26rft.eissn%3D1205-7533%26rft.epage%3D1362%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1350-1362%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1350%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D67&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
49,"Troni, N",2021 ,Water Quality Examination in the Stream Sediment of River Sitnica - the Assessment of Toxic Trace Elements,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"It is presently well-recognized that the contamination of aquatic sediments in Kosovo is a widespread phenomenon. The observation of the chemical analyses of water and sediments is essential to determine the extent of trace elements in these ecosystems. Hence, in order to be able to determine the mass concentration of the predominant elements present in river Sitnica, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) was used for this research. Moreover, a comparison of the mass concentration of water elements with the mass concentration of the elements found in the Sitnica sediments was provided. Utilizing the results obtained from the ICP-MS analysis, it was shown that the mass concentration of nickel, arsenic, zinc, cadmium, lead, copper, aluminum in certain water sample stations exceeds the permissible sediment quality criteria. Considering the toxicity that heavy metals exert on the aquatic environment, this research aimed to assess and measure the metal toxicity, because only then, a proper solution can be suggested to sustain freshwater ecosystems and to prevent constant damage from the human activity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000615899100003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DWater%2BQuality%2BExamination%2Bin%2Bthe%2BStream%2BSediment%2Bof%2BRiver%2BSitnica%2B-%2Bthe%2BAssessment%2Bof%2BToxic%2BTrace%2BElements%26rft.aufirst%3DNaser%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DTroni%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.12911%252F22998993%252F131062%26rft.epage%3D243%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2299-8993%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BECOLOGICAL%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D234-243%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D234%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BECOL%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D22%26rft.au%3DTroni%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DHoti%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DGashi%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D71fKrGYXVs66bBBpvRs1b&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ECOLOGICAL+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
