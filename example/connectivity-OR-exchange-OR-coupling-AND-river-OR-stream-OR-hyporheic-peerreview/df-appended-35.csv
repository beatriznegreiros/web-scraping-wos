0,0,"Rawitch, M",Dec 2019 ,Exploring methods of measuring CO2 degassing in headwater streams,SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) degassed from ungauged, headwater streams has a significant role in carbon cycling and climate change, making the precise measurement of the degassing of critical importance. Although methods exist for quantifying degassing rates in large bodies of water (seawater, lakes), these methods are often considered invalid for measuring degassing rates in small, turbulent, groundwater fed headwater streams. This manuscript reviews the physics of gas transfer across the stream-atmosphere interface and provides an in-depth critical review of the available methods of measuring CO2 degassing. Further, it discusses applications for some of these methods in small headwater streams and other low-order streams that are dominated by discharged groundwater. Of the methods reviewed, almost all produce fairly low precision and do not compare well with other methods tested in the same location. We suggest much more work is needed to improve the precision and accuracy of field-measured gas transfer coefficients, both by applying multiple methods in the field and by controlled laboratory experiments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000494686800030,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExploring%2Bmethods%2Bof%2Bmeasuring%2BCO2%2Bdegassing%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DRawitch%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs40899-019-00332-3%26rft.eissn%3D2363-5045%26rft.epage%3D1779%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2363-5037%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABLE%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1765-1779%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1765%26rft.stitle%3DSUST%2BWAT%2BRESOUR%2BMAN%26rft.volume%3D5%26rft.au%3DRawitch%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DMacpherson%252C%2BGL%26rft.au%3DBrookfield%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABLE+WATER+RESOURCES+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s40899-019-00332-3,"Carbon dioxide flux,Carbon cycling,Headwater streams,Atmospheric exchange rate,Gas transfer coefficient","SEA GAS-EXCHANGE,CARBON-DIOXIDE,CHAMBER MEASUREMENTS,FOREST STREAM,WIND-SPEED,CH4,EMISSIONS,REAERATION,EVASION,RIVERS",,"Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, 1475 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA"
1,1,"Higashino, M",Apr 2016 ,Water temperature dynamics and heat transport in a typical Japanese river,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"The water temperature regime of the Oita River on Kyushu Island (33 degrees N latitude) in southern Japan is illustrated and analyzed, and related to the river's hydrology. The river is short (55 km) and steep (ave. slope = 0.088), and has a flashy flow regime. Precipitation is high (1653 mm year(-1)) and divided between a wet monsoon season, typhoons, and a dry season in winter. A base flow analysis showed that groundwater contributes about 50 % of the annual flow to the Oita River and controls the river's heat budget. At a measured mean annual temperature of similar to 16 degrees C, groundwater (base flow) input causes unexpected cool (<= 24 degrees C) river temperatures in summer and warm (>= 8 degrees C) river temperatures in winter. The Oita River is typical of many Japanese rivers. Its hydraulic residence time is very short (0.5-1.5 days) and limits the heat exchange with the atmosphere so that a significant deficit remains between observed river water temperatures and equilibrium temperatures in mid-summer and mid-winter. Correlations of recorded stream temperatures with atmospheric temperatures (air, dew point and equilibrium temperatures) were strong. Weekly air and stream temperature data (averaged from 10-min measurements) were fitted by linear regressions with R-2 = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.83 degrees C. Daily data were only slightly less well correlated with R-2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 1.17 degrees C. The relationships were highly linear. The slope of the stream temperature vs. air temperature correlation was in the range from 0.63 (weekly) to 0.58 (daily) indicating that stream temperatures are dominated by groundwater input. Air and stream temperatures have a strong correlation in both wet (monsoon) and dry seasons, and geothermal heat input has no basin-wide effect; the 50 % groundwater (base flow) input raises the annual mean and reduces seasonal temperature amplitude in the Oita River and provides a cool-water stream. Water temperatures were gathered from a long-term monitoring database and by recent (2012-2013) high-resolution instream monitoring. Key drivers of stream temperature were identified. Linear regressions were used to relate air temperature, dew point temperature, and equilibrium temperature with stream temperature. Groundwater was identified as a key input of water consistently around 16 degrees C, moderating temperatures in the summer and winter due to very short water residence times in the steep and short river. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge about global stream temperatures, and clarifies specific questions for Japanese rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000373635400077,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B618%26rft.atitle%3DWater%2Btemperature%2Bdynamics%2Band%2Bheat%2Btransport%2Bin%2Ba%2Btypical%2BJapanese%2Briver%26rft.aufirst%3DMakoto%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DHigashino%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-016-5390-2%26rft.eissn%3D1866-6299%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D75%26rft.au%3DHigashino%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DStefan%252C%2BHG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-016-5390-2,"Air/water interface,Climate,Heat budget,Japan,Stream,Water temperature,Equilibrium temperature,Groundwater","REGRESSION-MODEL,STREAM,FISH,GROUNDWATER,SIMULATION,MINNESOTA,HABITAT,SYSTEM,LAKES",,"Oita Natl Coll Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1666 Maki, Oita 8700152, Japan"
2,2,"Reinfelds, I",Jun 1 2004 ,"Assessment of downstream trends in channel gradient, total and specific stream power: a GIS approach",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analyses of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) coupled with catchment area based discharge estimation techniques provide a relatively simple means of modelling contiguous downstream trends in channel gradient, total stream power, and in riverscapes conducive to regime analysis, also specific stream power. For a small, high relief, coastal catchment in SE Australia, good agreement was obtained between channel gradients derived from a 25 m cell-size DEM and field survey equivalents over distances of several kilometres, indicating that channel gradients derived from DEMs can have a reasonable degree of absolute as well as relative accuracy over multi-kilometre reach scales. Assessment of downstream rates of change in channel gradient and specific stream power across four river systems suggests that some of the river reaches most responsive to high magnitude floods occur in zones where these variables rapidly decrease downstream. Modelling of downstream trends in channel gradient, total and specific stream power from catchment-wide DEMs has potential to provide a framework with which to investigate conceptual and empirical models between channel gradient, stream power and the form and dynamics of river systems.

3,3,"Trevarrow, E",Jul 2022 ,The role of large wood in streams as ecological corridors for wildlife biodiversity,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Until the 1980s, large wood removal from streams was widely promoted across North America because in-stream logs were considered undesirable. At present, millions of dollars are invested annually to place large wood back in streams owing to its importance for the geomorphology of channels, stream discharge, sediment deposits, and habitat for fish. Yet, little is known about the role of large wood in streams for wildlife. Here, we used 12 months of camera trap videos (effort of 4703 camera days) to document wildlife biodiversity and animal activities at several log complexes located in Rock Creek, Willamette River basin, Oregon. Our dataset (1921 independent videos) documented up to 40 species including small mammals, aquatic and terrestrial birds, meso-carnivores, large carnivores, and semi-aquatic mammals. We found a strong seasonality in detections and species richness with the highest values occurring in summer and spring, and the lowest values in winter. There were idiosyncratic responses for species richness and assemblages at each large wood complex. Most common animal activities included movement (68%), rest (18%), and food handling/eating (9%) suggesting that large wood structures in streams act as lateral corridors connecting terrestrial habitats year-round for wildlife. Collectively, we reveal multiple functions that large wood plays to support wildlife biodiversity across the aquatic-terrestrial interface demonstrating the value of restoration projects that involve wood placement into streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000810371400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Brole%2Bof%2Blarge%2Bwood%2Bin%2Bstreams%2Bas%2Becological%2Bcorridors%2Bfor%2Bwildlife%2Bbiodiversity%26rft.aufirst%3DEzmie%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DTrevarrow%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10531-022-02437-2%26rft.eissn%3D1572-9710%26rft.epage%3D2178%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0960-3115%26rft.issue%3D8-9%26rft.jtitle%3DBIODIVERSITY%2BAND%2BCONSERVATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2163-2178%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2163%26rft.stitle%3DBIODIVERS%2BCONSERV%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DTrevarrow%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DArismendi%252C%2BI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=BIODIVERSITY+AND+CONSERVATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10531-022-02437-2,"Logjams,River restoration,Riparian ecology,Riparian biodiversity","RESTORATION,DEBRIS,PROJECTS,HABITAT",,"Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Sci, Nash Hall 104, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA"
4,4,"Warix, SR",May 2021 ,Influence of groundwater and topography on stream drying in semi-arid headwater streams,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Non-perennial streams comprise over half of the global stream network and impact downstream water quality. Although aridity is a primary driver of stream drying globally, surface flow permanence varies spatially and temporally within many headwater streams, suggesting that these complex drying patterns may be driven by topographic and subsurface factors. Indeed, these factors affect shallow groundwater flows in perennial systems, but there has been only limited characterisation of shallow groundwater residence times and groundwater contributions to intermittent streams. Here, we asked how groundwater residence times, shallow groundwater contributions to streamflow, and topography interact to control stream drying in headwater streams. We evaluated this overarching question in eight semi-arid headwater catchments based on surface flow observations during the low-flow period, coupled with tracer-based groundwater residence times. For one headwater catchment, we analysed stream drying during the seasonal flow recession and rewetting period using a sensor network that was interspersed between groundwater monitoring locations, and linked drying patterns to groundwater inputs and topography. We found a poor relationship between groundwater residence times and flowing network extent (R-2 < 0.24). Although groundwater residence times indicated that old groundwater was present in all headwater streams, surface drying also occurred in each of them, suggesting old, deep flowpaths are insufficient to sustain surface flows. Indeed, the timing of stream drying at any given point typically coincided with a decrease in the contribution from near-surface sources and an increased relative contribution of groundwater to streamflow at that location, whereas the spatial pattern of drying within the stream network typically correlated with locations where groundwater inputs were most seasonally variable. Topographic metrics only explained similar to 30% of the variability in seasonal flow permanence, and surprisingly, we found no correlation with seasonal drying and down-valley subsurface storage area. Because we found complex spatial patterns, future studies should pair dense spatial observations of subsurface properties, such as hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity, to observations of seasonal flow permanence.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000655496700036,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be14185%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%2Band%2Btopography%2Bon%2Bstream%2Bdrying%2Bin%2Bsemi-arid%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DSara%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DSR%26rft.aulast%3DWarix%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.14185%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DWarix%252C%2BSR%26rft.au%3DGodsey%252C%2BSE%26rft.au%3DHale%252C%2BRL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.14185,"groundwater,groundwater residence time,intermittent streams,topography","COLORADO RIVER-BASIN,HYDROGRAPH SEPARATION,FLOW INTERMITTENCY,TRANSIT TIMES,BASEFLOW,WATER,SNOW,CONNECTIVITY,CIRCULATION,EVOLUTION",,"Colorado Sch Mines, Hydrol Sci & Engn, Golden, CO 80401 USA"
5,5,"Zhou, T",Jun 2020 ,The Straightening of a River Meander Leads to Extensive Losses in Flow Complexity and Ecosystem Services,WATER,"To assist river restoration efforts we need to slow the rate of river degradation. This study provides a detailed explanation of the hydraulic complexity loss when a meandering river is straightened in order to motivate the protection of river channel curvature. We used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to document the difference in flow dynamics in nine simulations with channel curvature (C) degrading from a well-established tight meander bend (C= 0.77) to a straight channel without curvature (C= 0). To control for covariates and slow the rate of loss to hydraulic complexity, each of the nine-channel realizations had equivalent bedform topography. The analyzed hydraulic variables included the flow surface elevation, streamwise and transverse unit discharge, flow velocity at streamwise, transverse, and vertical directions, bed shear stress, stream function, and the vertical hyporheic flux rates at the channel bed. The loss of hydraulic complexity occurred gradually when initially straightening the channel fromC= 0.77 toC= 0.33 (i.e., the radius of the channel is three-times the channel width), and additional straightening incurred rapid losses to hydraulic complexity. Other studies have shown hydraulic complexity provides important riverine habitat and is positively correlated with biodiversity. This study demonstrates how hydraulic complexity can be gradually and then rapidly lost when unwinding a river, and hopefully will serve as a cautionary tale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000549442300001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1680%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BStraightening%2Bof%2Ba%2BRiver%2BMeander%2BLeads%2Bto%2BExtensive%2BLosses%2Bin%2BFlow%2BComplexity%2Band%2BEcosystem%2BServices%26rft.aufirst%3DTian%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DZhou%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12061680%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DEndreny%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w12061680,"river engineering,meander bend,CFD simulation,hydraulic complexity","RESTORATION,EXCHANGE,DYNAMICS",,"SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Resources Engn, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA"
6,6,"Jardine, TD",Mar 2012 ,Consumer-resource coupling in wet-dry tropical rivers,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,"1. Despite implications for top-down and bottom-up control and the stability of food webs, understanding the links between consumers and their diets remains difficult, particularly in remote tropical locations where food resources are usually abundant and variable and seasonal hydrology produces alternating patterns of connectivity and isolation.2. We used a large scale survey of freshwater biota from 67 sites in three catchments (Daly River, Northern Territory; Fitzroy River, Western Australia; and the Mitchell River, Queensland) in Australia's wet-dry tropics and analysed stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) to search for broad patterns in resource use by consumers in conjunction with known and measured indices of connectivity, the duration of floodplain inundation, and dietary choices (i.e. stomach contents of fish).3. Regression analysis of biofilm delta C-13 against consumer delta C-13, as an indicator of reliance on local food sources (periphyton and detritus), varied depending on taxa and catchment.4. The carbon isotope ratios of benthic invertebrates were tightly coupled to those of biofilm in all three catchments, suggesting assimilation of local resources by these largely nonmobile taxa.5. Stable C isotope ratios of fish, however, were less well-linked to those of biofilm and varied by catchment according to hydrological connectivity; the perennially flowing Daly River with a long duration of floodplain inundation showed the least degree of coupling, the seasonally flowing Fitzroy River with an extremely short flood period showed the strongest coupling, and the Mitchell River was intermediate in connectivity, flood duration and consumer-resource coupling.6. These findings highlight the high mobility of the fish community in these rivers, and how hydrological connectivity between habitats drives patterns of consumer-resource coupling.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000300502600002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConsumer-resource%2Bcoupling%2Bin%2Bwet-dry%2Btropical%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DTimothy%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DTD%26rft.aulast%3DJardine%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2656.2011.01925.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2656%26rft.epage%3D322%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0021-8790%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BANIMAL%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D310-322%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D310%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BANIM%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D81%26rft.au%3DJardine%252C%2BTD%26rft.au%3DPettit%252C%2BNE%26rft.au%3DBunn%252C%2BSE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+ANIMAL+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01925.x,"biofilm,energy sources,floodplain,food webs,gut contents,hydrology,stable isotope analysis","FOOD-WEB,STABLE-ISOTOPE,RELATIVE IMPORTANCE,AUTOTROPHIC CARBON,FISH,DYNAMICS,FLOW,TERRESTRIAL,VARIABILITY,AUSTRALIA",,"Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia"

This study presents an integrated framework that couples a mesoscale atmospheric analysis system (SAFRAN), an agronomic model (STICS) and a distributed hydro(geo)logic model (EauDyssee) to estimate nitrogen flux at the regional scale. The EauDyssee modeling framework was developed to include nitrate transport from soils to rivers via surface runoff and stream-aquifer interactions. Further, an in-stream nitrate model was developed based on the large-scale river routing of the framework. The utility of the integrated framework was demonstrated on the Seine River Basin (SRB), which has an area of 88,000 square kilometers. The SRB is one of the most productive agricultural areas in France and encompasses the megalopolis of Paris. This basin is a complex hydrosystem with multiple aquifers. The STICS-EauDyssee integrated framework was implemented for a long-term simulation covering 39 years (1971-2010) at a daily time step. Comparison of groundwater nitrate concentrations with observations showed an overall absolute bias of less than 10 mg/L. Model results showed that simulated nitrate flux to rivers highly depend on the inflow produced by surface and subsurface waters. Results also demonstrated that approximately 10% of leaching nitrate flux is delivered to the river network from stream-aquifer interactions. The statistical analysis indicates the modeling system performs better in the eastern region of the SRB in comparison to the western part of the basin, due to the hydrological complexity of the western part of the basin. Comparison of maximum nitrate concentration between dry and wet years (1990 and 2001) showed an increase of 60%, largely driven by more annual water yield in the wet year compared to the dry year.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000455694400075,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2Bintegrated%2Bframework%2Bto%2Bmodel%2Bnitrate%2Bcontaminants%2Bwith%2Binteractions%2Bof%2Bagriculture%252C%2Bgroundwater%252C%2Band%2Bsurface%2Bwater%2Bat%2Bregional%2Bscales%253A%2BThe%2BSTICS-EauDyssee%2Bcoupled%2Bmodels%2Bapplied%2Bover%2Bthe%2BSeine%2BRiver%2BBasin%26rft.aufirst%3DAhmad%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DAA%26rft.aulast%3DTavakoly%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2018.11.061%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.epage%3D958%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D943-958%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D943%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D568%26rft.au%3DTavakoly%252C%2BAA%26rft.au%3DHabets%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DMaidment%252C%2BDR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.061,"Nitrate flux,Surface-aquifer interactions,Regional scale modeling,Distributed hydrologic modeling,Seine River Basin","STREAM-AQUIFER EXCHANGES,LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS,NITROGEN BALANCES,GENERIC MODEL,SIMULATION,POLLUTION,FLOW,DENITRIFICATION,EUTROPHICATION,VALIDATION",,"5825 Univ Res Court, College Pk, MD 20740 USA"
9,9,"Lewandowski, J",Sep 30 2011 ,A heat pulse technique for the determination of small-scale flow directions and flow velocities in the streambed of sand-bed streams,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The hyporheic zone (HZ) has the capability to eliminate and attenuate nutrients and contaminants in riverine systems. Biogeochemical reactions and the potential elimination of contaminants are strongly controlled by the flow paths and dynamics in the HZ. Nevertheless, an easily applicable method for the field determination of flow patterns in the HZ is still lacking. Therefore, a heat pulse technique, which traces the movement of a short heat pulse in the upper part of the HZ and other sand beds, was developed. Five rods are vertically driven into the sediment of the streambed; one rod with a heater as point source located in about 10-cm sediment depth and four rods with four temperature sensors in 3 cm distance, arranged concentrically with 7 cm diameter around the heating rod. Subsequently, a heat pulse is applied and the resulting breakthrough curves are indicative of flow velocities and flow directions in the streambed. A rough data analysis procedure is also suggested. In addition, laboratory experiments were performed to test the heat pulse technique. These experiments were validated based on coupled numerical modelling of flow and heat transport. First field tests of the method prove that the method is easily applicable under field conditions. These first field tests showed highly complex flow patterns with flow velocities from 1.8 to 4.9 cm min(-1) and flow directions from parallel to surface flow to opposite to surface flow. This suggests the need for a robust method to quantify hyporheic flow patterns in situ.

10,10,"Falk, MG",Dec 2014 ,Sampling designs on stream networks using the pseudo-Bayesian approach,ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS,"Monitoring stream networks through time provides important ecological information. The sampling design problem is to choose locations where measurements are taken so as to maximise information gathered about physicochemical and biological variables on the stream network. This paper uses a pseudo-Bayesian approach, averaging a utility function over a prior distribution, in finding a design which maximizes the average utility. We use models for correlations of observations on the stream network that are based on stream network distances and described by moving average error models. Utility functions used reflect the needs of the experimenter, such as prediction of location values or estimation of parameters. We propose an algorithmic approach to design with the mean utility of a design estimated using Monte Carlo techniques and an exchange algorithm to search for optimal sampling designs. In particular we focus on the problem of finding an optimal design from a set of fixed designs and finding an optimal subset of a given set of sampling locations. As there are many different variables to measure, such as chemical, physical and biological measurements at each location, designs are derived from models based on different types of response variables: continuous, counts and proportions. We apply the methodology to a synthetic example and the Lake Eacham stream network on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, Australia. We show that the optimal designs depend very much on the choice of utility function, varying from space filling to clustered designs and mixtures of these, but given the utility function, designs are relatively robust to the type of response variable.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000345322300009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSampling%2Bdesigns%2Bon%2Bstream%2Bnetworks%2Busing%2Bthe%2Bpseudo-Bayesian%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DMatthew%2BG.%26rft.auinit%3DMG%26rft.aulast%3DFalk%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10651-014-0279-2%26rft.eissn%3D1573-3009%26rft.epage%3D773%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1352-8505%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BAND%2BECOLOGICAL%2BSTATISTICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D751-773%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D751%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BECOL%2BSTAT%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DFalk%252C%2BMG%26rft.au%3DMcGree%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DPettitt%252C%2BAN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+AND+ECOLOGICAL+STATISTICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10651-014-0279-2,"Exchange algorithm,Pseudo-Bayesian design,Stream network,Utility function","SPATIAL STATISTICAL-MODELS,MOVING-AVERAGE APPROACH,PREDICTION",,"QUT, Math Sci Sci & Engn Fac, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia"

The hydrochemical facies is Ca2+-HCO3- types for most of the samples. Gibbs ratio and Cl-/[sum anion] ratio shows that the rock weathering is the primary source of solute in stream water. Apportioning of the weathering indicated that silicate, carbonate and mixed type of weathering are dominated by 52%, 19%, and 29% respectively in the watersheds. Base ion exchange index (IBI CaI1, IBII CaI2) suggested that stream chemistry is influenced by ion exchange and stream water also has deeper sources of water through joints and fissures in the watersheds. A comparison between ion concentrations in the samples suggested that few samples had magnesium and fluoride more than permissible limits. Based on dissolved ions in stream water, the water quality index indicates 80%, 14%, and 6% falls into the excellent to good, poor and unsuitable category respectively.

12,12,"Park, J",Sep 2017 ,Coupling fine particle and bedload transport in gravel-bedded streams,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Fine particles in the silt- and clay-size range are important determinants of surface water quality. Since fine particle loading rates are not unique functions of stream discharge this limits the utility of the available models for water quality assessment. Data from 38 minimally developed watersheds within the United States Geological Survey stream gauging network in California, USA reveal three lines of evidence that fine particle release is coupled with bedload transport. First, there is a transition in fine particle loading rate as a function of discharge for gravel-bedded sediments that does not appear when the sediment bed is composed of sand, cobbles, boulders, or bedrock. Second, the discharge at the transition in the loading rate is correlated with the initiation of gravel mobilization. Third, high frequency particle concentration and discharge data are dominated by clockwise hysteresis where rising limb discharges generally have higher concentrations than falling limb discharges. These three observations across multiple watersheds lead to a conceptual model that fine particles accumulate within the sediment bed at discharges less than the transition and then the gravel bed fluidizes with fine particle release at discharges above the transition discharge. While these observations were individually recognized in the literature, this analysis provides a consistent conceptual model based on the coupling of fine particle dynamics with filtration at low discharges and gravel bed fluidization at higher discharges.

13,13,"Larned, ST",Apr 2010 ,Emerging concepts in temporary-river ecology,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Temporary rivers and streams are among the most common and most hydrologically dynamic freshwater ecosystems. The number of temporary rivers and the severity of flow intermittence may be increasing in regions affected by climatic drying trends or water abstraction. Despite their abundance, temporary rivers have been historically neglected by ecologists. A recent increase in temporary-river research needs to be supported by new models that generate hypotheses and stimulate further research. In this article, we present three conceptual models that address spatial and temporal patterns in temporary-river biodiversity and biogeochemistry.2. Temporary rivers are characterised by the repeated onset and cessation of flow, and by complex hydrological dynamics in the longitudinal dimension. Longitudinal dynamics, such as advancing and retreating wetted fronts, hydrological connections and disconnections, and gradients in flow permanence, influence biotic communities and nutrient and organic matter processing.3. The first conceptual model concerns connectivity between habitat patches. Variable connectivity suggests that the metacommunity and metapopulation concepts are applicable in temporary rivers. We predict that aggregations of local communities in the isolated water bodies of temporary rivers function as metacommunities. These metacommunities may become longitudinally nested due to interspecific differences in dispersal and mortality. The metapopulation concept applies to some temporary river species, but not all. In stable metapopulations, rates of local extinction are balanced by recolonisation. However, extinction and recolonisation in many temporary-river species are decoupled by frequent disturbances, and populations of these species are usually expanding or contracting.4. The second conceptual model predicts that large-scale biodiversity varies as a function of aquatic and terrestrial patch dynamics and water-level fluctuations. Habitat mosaics in temporary rivers change in composition and configuration in response to inundation and drying, and these changes elicit a range of biotic responses. In the model, aquatic biodiversity initially increases directly with water level due to increasing abundance of aquatic patches. When most of the channel is inundated and most aquatic patches are connected, further increases in aquatic habitat and connectivity cause aquatic biodiversity to decline due to community homogenisation and reduced habitat diversity. The predicted responses of terrestrial biodiversity to changes in water level are the inverse of aquatic biodiversity responses.5. The third conceptual model represents temporary rivers as longitudinal, punctuated biogeochemical reactors. Advancing fronts carry water, solutes and particulate organic matter downstream; subsequent flow recessions and drying result in deposition of transported material in reserves such as pools and bar tops. Material processing is rapid during inundated periods and slower during dry periods. The efficiency of material processing is predicted to increase with the number of cycles of transport, deposition and processing that occur down the length of a temporary river.6. We end with a call for conservation and resource management that addresses the unique properties of temporary rivers. Primary objectives for effective temporary river management are preservation or restoration of aquatic-terrestrial habitat mosaics, preservation or restoration of natural flow intermittence, and identification of flow requirements for highly valued species and processes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000275676700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEmerging%2Bconcepts%2Bin%2Btemporary-river%2Becology%26rft.aufirst%3DScott%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DST%26rft.aulast%3DLarned%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1365-2427.2009.02322.x%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D738%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D717-738%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D717%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DLarned%252C%2BST%26rft.au%3DDatry%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DTockner%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02322.x,"Aquatic-terrestrial habitat mosaics,connectivity,flow intermittence,meta-systems,temporary rivers","MEDITERRANEAN-CLIMATE STREAMS,LEAF-LITTER DECOMPOSITION,SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA,SONORAN DESERT STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,INVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES,INTERMITTENT-STREAM,EPHEMERAL RIVER,MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY",,"Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Christchurch, New Zealand"
14,14,"GARBAN, B",Feb 1995 ,"EXCHANGES AT THE SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE IN THE RIVER SEINE, DOWNSTREAM FROM PARIS",WATER RESEARCH,"The exchanges at the sediment-water interface were studied in the river Seine, downstream from Paris. Various species of nitrogen were considered. A budget of exchanges could be established between the sewage treatment plant at Acheres and Poses, 140 km downstream. For each of the three sites studied the sediments were characterized by their granulometry and their particulate organic carbon and particulate nitrogen contents. To quantify the exchanges between the sediments and the water two techniques were used: study of cores interstitial water and of dialysis cells water allow to establish vertical profiles for nitrogen and phosphorus, essential to calculate molecular diffusion; global exchanges at the interface were determined with a benthic bell-jar, whose water was regularly sampled until anoxy is reached. That study allowed the clarification of the exchange kinetics at the sediment-water interface with regards to the sludge deposited in the river from the sewage treatment plant. Denitrification played a minor role while ammonification of organic nitrogen seemed to be partially responsible for the ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations in the interstitial water. A notable release of phosphorus was also observed. The concentration gradients measured in the dialysis cells experiments were used to calculate the exchanges exclusively due to molecular diffusion, while the measurements obtained with benthic bell-jars took into account all the chemical, biological and physical phenomena. Thus the discrepancies found between the values of molecular diffusion and the exchange values obtained with benthic bell-jars were very marked. These last values allowed the establishment of the mean release budgets in the studied area: ammoniacal nitrogen, 13.4 t d(-1); phosphorus, 3.7 t d(-1).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1995QB74700010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEXCHANGES%2BAT%2BTHE%2BSEDIMENT-WATER%2BINTERFACE%2BIN%2BTHE%2BRIVER%2BSEINE%252C%2BDOWNSTREAM%2BFROM%2BPARIS%26rft.aufirst%3DB%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DGARBAN%26rft.date%3D1995%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252F0043-1354%252894%252900181-6%26rft.epage%3D481%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1354%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D473-481%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D473%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DGARBAN%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DOLLIVON%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DCHESTERIKOFF%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/0043-1354(94)00181-6,"RIVER SEINE,SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE,DIALYSIS CELLS,BENTHIC BELL-JARS,NITROGEN,PHOSPHORUS","PORE-WATER,INTERSTITIAL WATER,MARINE-SEDIMENTS,NITROGEN DIAGENESIS,ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS,DISTURBED SEDIMENTS,KINETIC-MODELS,DENITRIFICATION,NITRIFICATION,SAMPLER",,"INST HYDROL & CLIMATOL,4 PL JUSSIEU,TOUR 26,F-75005 PARIS,FRANCE"
15,15,"Essaid, HI",Dec 1 2017 ,Evaluating the impact of irrigation on surface water - groundwater interaction and stream temperature in an agricultural watershed,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Changes in groundwater discharge to streams caused by irrigation practices can influence stream temperature. Observations along two currently flood-irrigated reaches in the 640-square-kilometer upper Smith River watershed, an important agricultural and recreational fishing area in west-central Montana, showed a downstream temperature decrease resulting from groundwater discharge to the stream. A watershed-scale coupled surface water and groundwater flow model was used to examine changes in streamflow, groundwater discharge to the stream and stream temperature resulting from irrigation practices. The upper Smith River watershed was used to develop the model framework including watershed climate, topography, hydrography, vegetation, soil properties and current irrigation practices. Model results were used to compare watershed streamflow, groundwater recharge, and groundwater discharge to the stream for three scenarios: natural, pre-irrigation conditions (PreIrr); current irrigation practices involving mainly stream diversion for flood and sprinkler irrigation (IrrCurrent); and a hypothetical scenario with only groundwater supplying sprinkler irrigation (IrrGW). Irrigation increased groundwater recharge relative to natural PreIrr conditions because not all applied water was removed by crop evapotranspiration. Groundwater storage and groundwater discharge to the stream increased relative to natural PreIrr conditions when the source of irrigation water was mainly stream diversion as in the IrrCurrent scenario. The hypothetical IrrGW scenario, in which groundwater withdrawals were the sole source of irrigation water, resulted in widespread lowering of the water table and associated decreases in groundwater storage and groundwater discharge to the stream. A mixing analysis using model predicted groundwater discharge along the reaches suggests that stream diversion and flood irrigation, represented in the IrrCurrent scenario, has led to cooling of stream temperatures relative to natural PreIrr conditions improving fish thermal habitat. However, the decrease in groundwater discharge in the IrrGW scenario resulting from large-scale groundwater withdrawal for irrigation led to warmer than natural stream temperatures and possible degradation of fish habitat.

16,16,"Chenoweth, JL",Dec 2001 ,Analysis of factors influencing data and information exchange in international river basins - Can such exchanges be used to build confidence in cooperative management?,WATER INTERNATIONAL,"The exchange of data and information relating to transboundary water resources is widely accepted as being an appropriate starting point for more comprehensive cooperation. This paper examines under what conditions data and information exchange occur in relation to shared water resources, and hence examines when it can be used as a confidence building measure. An overview of several major international river basins together with more detailed case studies of the Mekong, Rio Grande, and Rhine River basins suggest that factors that promote data and information exchange include the presence of compatible needs, absence of legacies of mistrust, increasing water resources stress, perceptions that cooperation is of mutual benefit, external pressure and funding, comparable levels of institutional capacity, popular and political concern about water resources management, and functional formal or informal cooperative arrangements. Analysis of the situation prevailing between Israel and the Palestinians with regard to shared water resources suggests that data and information exchange does not seem likely in the short term, even though other forms of cooperation have been established with mixed results, This suggests that in some situations, at least, data and information exchange relating to shared water resources may not be useful as a first step in establishing more comprehensive cooperation.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000174124900006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAnalysis%2Bof%2Bfactors%2Binfluencing%2Bdata%2Band%2Binformation%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Binternational%2Briver%2Bbasins%2B-%2BCan%2Bsuch%2Bexchanges%2Bbe%2Bused%2Bto%2Bbuild%2Bconfidence%2Bin%2Bcooperative%2Bmanagement%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DJL%26rft.auinit%3DJL%26rft.aulast%3DChenoweth%26rft.date%3D2001%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F02508060108686951%26rft.eissn%3D1941-1707%26rft.epage%3D512%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0250-8060%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BINTERNATIONAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D499-512%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D499%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BINT%26rft.volume%3D26%26rft.au%3DChenoweth%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DFeitelson%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=WATER+INTERNATIONAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/02508060108686951,"data exchange,cooperation,international water resources,transboundary",,,"Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel"
17,17,"Drummond, JD",Mar 15 2018 ,Cryptosporidium oocyst persistence in agricultural streams -a mobile-immobile model framework assessment,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Rivers are a means of rapid and long-distance transmission of pathogenic microorganisms from upstream terrestrial sources. Pathogens enter streams and rivers via overland flow, shallow groundwater discharge, and direct inputs. Of concern is the protozoal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which can remain infective for weeks to months under cool and moist conditions, with the infectious stage (oocysts) largely resistant to chlorination. We applied a mobile-immobile model framework to assess Cryptosporidium transport and retention in streams, that also accounts for inactivation. The model is applied to California's Central Valley where Cryptosporidium exposure can be at higher risk due to agricultural and wildlife nonpoint sources. The results demonstrate that hyporheic exchange is an important process to include in models characterizing pathogen dynamics in streams, delaying downstream transmission and allowing for immobilization processes, such as reversible filtration in the sediments, to occur. Although in-stream concentrations decrease relatively quickly (within hours), pathogen accumulation of up to 66% of the inputs due to immobilization processes in the sediments and slower moving surface water could result in long retention times (months to years). The model appropriately estimates baseflow pathogen accumulation and can help predict the potential loads of resuspended pathogens in response to a storm event.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000427464700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B4603%26rft.atitle%3DCryptosporidium%2Boocyst%2Bpersistence%2Bin%2Bagricultural%2Bstreams%2B-a%2Bmobile-immobile%2Bmodel%2Bframework%2Bassessment%26rft.aufirst%3DJ.%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DDrummond%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41598-018-22784-x%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2045-2322%26rft.jtitle%3DSCIENTIFIC%2BREPORTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSCI%2BREP-UK%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DBoano%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=SCIENTIFIC+REPORTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1038/s41598-018-22784-x,,"ESCHERICHIA-COLI,BEEF-CATTLE,COLLOID TRANSPORT,PARVUM OOCYSTS,FECAL BACTERIA,RISK-FACTORS,FILTRATION,DYNAMICS,RETENTION,PARTICLES",,"CSIC, Ctr Adv Studies Blanes, CEAB, Integrat Freshwater Ecol Grp, Blanes, Girona, Spain"

21,21,"Simpson, CJ",Dec 2001 ,"The braided Milk River, northern Montana, fails the Leopold-Wolman discharge-gradient test",GEOMORPHOLOGY,"The Milk River, the northernmost tributary to the Missouri-Mississippi River system. exhibits an anomalous sand-bed braiding reach in an otherwise meandering system. Shortly after leaving Alberta and entering Montana the river suddenly changes to braiding and maintains this pattern for 47 km before entering Fresno Reservoir. Measured stream gradient and bankfull discharge in the braiding reach severely fail the Leopold and Wolman [U.S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Pap. 282B (1957) 39] slope-discharge test for differentiating channel patterns. While channel slope has long been regarded as one of the primary variables associated with braiding, our data from the sand-bed Milk River do not support this relationship. Instead, the data show that the braiding reach has a lower channel slope (0.00047) than the meandering reach (0.00055). Coupled with a constant discharge the unit length stream power is comparable between the two reaches. At the morphologic transition between meandering and braiding, a dramatic reduction in channel bank strength occurs where the sampled silt-clay content declines from 65% in the meandering reach to 18% in the braiding, This enables channel widening which is reflected in a 60% reduction in unit area stream power in the braiding reach. Thus, sediment transport capacity declines and channel bars are deposited. During waning flows, these bars are dissected, producing a braiding morphology. We suggest that for sand-bed braiding rivers the silt-clay percentage in the channel banks may be more important than slope. A review of the original Leopold and Wolman [U.S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Pap. 282B (1957) 39] dataset, and many subsequent analyses, reveals that most braided rivers studied were gravel-bed. As a result, causal variables associated with braiding in sand-bed environments may need a thorough evaluation. Oc 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

22,22,"Wei, XL",Jul 2021 ,Evaluating nitrate and phosphorus remediation in intensively irrigated stream-aquifer systems using a coupled flow and reactive transport model,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"In irrigated semi-arid watersheds, over-fertilization often leads to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contamination in aquifers and river systems. Modelling tools often are used to evaluate the effect of management practices on nutrient contamination levels. In this study, we assess a suite of best management practices (BMPs) for N and P in a regional irrigated stream-aquifer system using a new numerical model. As it is necessary to consider the interaction of flow in the stream and aquifer, SWAT-MODFLOW model that couples surface and groundwater flow was used. The reactive processes were modelled using RT3D that simulate the reactive groundwater transport. The model is based on the coupled flow model SWAT-MODFLOW, with the groundwater reactive transport model RT3D included to simulate the reactive groundwater transport of NO3 and soluble P and their interactions within the soil-aquifer-stream system. The assessment is performed for a highly managed 732 km(2) region in the Lower Arkansas River Valley (south-eastern Colorado), with model results compared to observed groundwater nutrient concentration, in-stream nutrient concentration and loading, and crop yield. A total of 28 BMPs scenarios are evaluated regarding their impact on NO3 and soluble P contamination in the aquifer and river system. The most effective individual BMP in most areas is to decrease fertilizer by 30%, resulting in NO3 and soluble P reduced by 20% and 2% for groundwater concentrations, 25% and 10% for river concentrations, and 27% and 6% for mass loadings into surface water, respectively. Combinations of using 30% irrigation reduction, 30% fertilization reduction, 60% canal seepage reduction, and conservation tillage yield the greatest overall impact to lower NO3 and soluble P concentrations up to 41% and 8% in groundwater, 52% and 40% in river, and 63% and 49% for mass loadings. Targeting BMPs on localized problem areas shows great promise in reducing contamination while maintaining region-wide crop yield. The study demonstrates the SWAT-MODFLOW-RT3D modelling code is a useful tool to examine NO3 and P transport and quantify BMP effects in groundwater-driven watersheds.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000661813200114,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B126304%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluating%2Bnitrate%2Band%2Bphosphorus%2Bremediation%2Bin%2Bintensively%2Birrigated%2Bstream-aquifer%2Bsystems%2Busing%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2Bflow%2Band%2Breactive%2Btransport%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaolu%26rft.auinit%3DXL%26rft.aulast%3DWei%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2021.126304%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D598%26rft.au%3DWei%252C%2BXL%26rft.au%3DBailey%252C%2BRT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126304,"Nitrate,Phosphorus,SWAT-MODFLOW-RT3D,Surface and groundwater solute transport modelling,Intensively irrigated system,BMP","WATER ASSESSMENT-TOOL,SWAT-MODFLOW MODEL,MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES,CATCHMENT SCALE,LOAD REDUCTIONS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,GROUNDWATER,QUALITY,RIVER,IMPACTS",,"Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1372 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA"

However, at depth, catchment groundwater is linked to channel water via the hyporheic zone. Complex hydrological interactions between these two water masses in the hyporheic zone, combined with biogeochemical processes, produce a set of physicochemical conditions that support the hyporheos - a community of invertebrates and microorganisms. There is evidence that the hyporheos contains unique elements, but also some that indicates transition to benthic communities and processes above, and to those of true groundwater below. While some aspects of these communities are becoming known, for example their composition is influenced by depth-related variables and interstitial water temperature, many others, such as the response of bacteria to different sources and concentrations of DOC and nitrogen, and whether protists provide a trophic link between microorganism and invertebrates, are still poorly understood. Drawing on historical and new knowledge revealed by a variety of contemporary techniques for characterizing interstitial water and its inhabitants, this paper will attempt to address some of these uncertainties and also, formally, examine the candidacy of the hyporheic zone as an ecotone.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000281759300006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEcotonal%2Band%2Bother%2Bproperties%2Bof%2Bthe%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DD.%2BDudley%26rft.auinit%3DDD%26rft.aulast%3DWilliams%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252F1863-9135%252F2010%252F0176-0349%26rft.epage%3D364%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D349-364%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D349%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D176%26rft.au%3DWilliams%252C%2BDD%26rft.au%3DFebria%252C%2BCM%26rft.au%3DWong%252C%2BJCY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0176-0349,"interstitial water,ecotone,physicochemical conditions,invertebrates,microorganisms,historical data,industrial pollution,urbanization,global warming","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES,LONGITUDINAL PATTERNS,SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION,BACTERIAL BIOMASS,RIVER,GROUNDWATER,DYNAMICS,INVERTEBRATES,EXCHANGE",,"Univ Toronto, 1265 Mil Trail, Scarborough, ON M1C 1A4, Canada"

In this paper,a mathematical method to describe the time-periodic oscillating streaming potential was established from the coupling model of the flowing filed in porous media and the electrical current field by the capillary tubes model of the porous media. The frequency response of the dynamic permeability, electrokinetic coupling coefficient and the streaming potential coupling coefficient are shown to be dependent on the porosity and electrochemical properties in-the reservoir rock. The results show that the frequency dispersion characteristics of the streaming potential are dependent on the interaction between the inertial effects and the viscous effects of fluid. The critical frequency decreases when the porosity increases,And there is no influence of the concentration and cation exchange capacity of the fluid on the critical frequency. The coupling coefficient of the streaming potential increases with the increasing of the porosity. The effect of the electric double-layer on the solid-liquid interface in the pore decreases with the increasing of the concentration of the fluid, and the coupling coefficient decreases with the increasing of the concentration of fluid.

25,25,"Liu, SN",May-jun 2018 ,Impacts of Streambed Heterogeneity and Anisotropy on Residence Time of Hyporheic Zone,GROUNDWATER,"The hyporheic zone (HZ), which is the region beneath or alongside a streambed, plays an important role in the stream's ecology. The duration that a water molecule or a solute remains within the HZ, or residence time (RT), is one of the most common metrics used to evaluate the function of the HZ. The RT is greatly influenced by the streambed's hydraulic conductivity (K), which is intrinsically difficult to characterize due to its heterogeneity and anisotropy. Many laboratory and numerical studies of the HZ have simplified the streambed K to a constant, thus producing RT values that may differ from those gathered from the field. Some studies have considered the heterogeneity of the HZ, but very few have accounted for anisotropy or the natural K distributions typically found in real streambeds. This study developed numerical models in MODFLOW to examine the influence of heterogeneity and anisotropy, and that of the natural K distribution in a streambed, on the RT of the HZ. Heterogeneity and anisotropy were both found to shorten the mean and median RTs while increasing the range of the RTs. Moreover, heterogeneous K fields arranged in a more orderly pattern had longer RTs than those with random K distributions. These results could facilitate the design of streambed K values and distributions to achieve the desired RT during river restoration. They could also assist the translation of results from the more commonly considered homogeneous and/or isotropic conditions into heterogeneous and anisotropic field situations.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000431992600007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpacts%2Bof%2BStreambed%2BHeterogeneity%2Band%2BAnisotropy%2Bon%2BResidence%2BTime%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DSuning%26rft.auinit%3DSN%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12589%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D436%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D425-436%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D425%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BSN%26rft.au%3DChui%252C%2BTFM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gwat.12589,,"WATER EXCHANGE,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,RIVER RESTORATION,LOW-FLOW,AQUIFER,TRANSPORT,ECOSYSTEMS,MANAGEMENT,CHANNEL",,"Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Room 6-18A,Haking Wong Bldg, Pokfulam 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China"

The results suggested that (1) the CCD presents spatial heterogeneity, with the Pearl River Delta having the highest value and the middle reaches having the lowest value; (2) the coupling coordination type between CE and ED changes from incoordination to coordination in general; and (3) the resident income and population size have a positive influence on the CCD of the cities in the lower reaches, while the secondary industry scale has a beneficial impact on the upstream.

The main factors that influenced larval Odonata assemblages in forest streams were low temperatures and high oxygen levels in water, coupled with a high diversity of the substrate and riparian vegetation; in pasture streams and coffee plantation streams, sedimentation strongly affected the composition of larval Odonata assemblages. In all the streams, species richness ((0) D) was higher during the dry season. The highest Shannon alpha diversity ((1) D) values were found in forest streams during the rainy season; however, in pasture and coffee plantation streams, (1) D values were higher during the dry season. The low species turnover in forest streams suggests that these streams provide highly stable conditions for Odonata assemblages; however, in pasture and coffee plantation streams, the higher turnover was related to the more variable water and habitat conditions. Thus, the persistence of Odonata assemblages in the upper La Antigua River watershed is closely related to the conservation status of the tropical montane cloud forests.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000388173000002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bland%2Buse%2Bon%2Blarval%2BOdonata%2Bassemblages%2Bin%2Bcloud%2Bforest%2Bstreams%2Bin%2Bcentral%2BVeracruz%252C%2BMexico%26rft.aufirst%3DP.%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DPL%26rft.aulast%3DGarcia-Garcia%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10750-016-2900-x%26rft.eissn%3D1573-5117%26rft.epage%3D33%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D19-33%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D19%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D785%26rft.au%3DGarcia-Garcia%252C%2BPL%26rft.au%3DVazquez%252C%2BG%26rft.au%3DFavila%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10750-016-2900-x,"Odonata larvae,Water quality,Tropical streams,Montane cloud forest,Pasture,Coffee plantation","MACROINVERTEBRATE DRIFT,PARTITIONING DIVERSITY,HABITAT,CONSERVATION,SEDIMENT,CORDULEGASTRIDAE,ECOSYSTEMS,RIVER",,"Inst Ecol AC, Red Ecol Func, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico"
28,28,"Hill, MJ",Sep 2022 ,Organic-matter decomposition in urban stream and pond habitats,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Organic-matter decomposition is a key ecosystem process in freshwater ecosystems as it influences food web dynamics, represents a considerable flux in the global carbon cycle and can provide a useful measure of the 'health' of freshwater habitats. While organic-matter decomposition has been well studied among lotic ecosystems, research from small standing waterbodies such as ponds is largely missing, and decomposition studies are usually conducted on a single freshwater habitat type. However, there is a need to consider ecosystem processes across multiple freshwater habitats and connected ecosystems to better characterise ecosystem functioning at the landscape-scale, given the interdependence of landscape elements. This study provides a comparative analysis of organic-matter decomposition using a standardised field assay (cotton-strip assay) in the water column, riparian zone and land zone of urban pond and stream habitats. The average daily tensile-strength loss of the cotton strips (a process that corresponds to the catabolism of cellulose by microbes) was significantly higher in the aquatic habitats than riparian and land zones when all sites were considered, and when stream and pond sites were considered separately. Furthermore, the average decomposition rate was significantly higher within the water column in river habitats compared to pond habitats, although no difference was observed among riparian and land zones. Woody debris had a negative unimodal association with average per day tensile strength loss within streams, and a positive unimodal association within pond sites. Both nitrate and shading had positive unimodal associations with average per day tensile strength loss within stream sites. Among pond habitat, urban land coverage within 250m of each site was identified to have a negative association with average per day tensile strength loss. Here we demonstrated that urban freshwater habitats have heterogeneous organic matter decomposition rates, and that the responses can be complex. Understanding key ecosystem processes at a multihabitat scale will ensure the effective inclusion of ecosystem process in freshwater assessment and conservation protocols and improve the health and resilience of urban freshwater ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000864463300004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B109232%26rft.atitle%3DOrganic-matter%2Bdecomposition%2Bin%2Burban%2Bstream%2Band%2Bpond%2Bhabitats%26rft.aufirst%3DMatthew%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DHill%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecolind.2022.109232%26rft.eissn%3D1872-7034%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1470-160X%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BINDICATORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BINDIC%26rft.volume%3D142%26rft.au%3DHill%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DThornhill%252C%2BI%26rft.au%3DHobbs%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+INDICATORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109232,"Cotton-strip assay,Ecosystem function,Ecosystem process,Leaf litter,Rivers,Ponds,Resilience,Stream health,Ecosystem health,Urbanisation","LEAF-LITTER DECOMPOSITION,MULTIPLE STRESSORS,ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION,WOODY DEBRIS,BREAKDOWN,BIODIVERSITY,LANDSCAPES,DIVERSITY,IMPACTS,LEAVES",,"Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England"

Urbanization is an important driving factor in promoting the domestic economic cycle, while tourism is an emerging force in the development of urbanization. The convergence of these two factors will contribute to the high-quality development of regional economies. By constructing an evaluation index system of tourism development and urbanization level, 26 cities in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration have been identified as the study area. The study has adopted the entropy method and the coupling coordination model to analyze the comprehensive development level of tourism and urbanization and the coupling coordination relationship between them from 2008 to 2018. The results show that the Yangtze River Delta presents a spatial pattern of orderly changes in the development of tourism, forming a spatial structure of ""one pole and many centers"", with Shanghai as the core.

30,30,"Son, S",Nov 2020 ,Locality/Fairness-Aware Job Scheduling in Distributed Stream Processing Engines,ELECTRONICS,"Distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs) deploy multiple tasks on distributed servers to process data streams in real time. Many DSPEs have provided locality-aware stream partitioning (LSP) methods to reduce network communication costs. However, an even job scheduler provided by DSPEs deploys tasks far away from each other on the distributed servers, which cannot use the LSP properly. In this paper, we propose a Locality/Fairness-aware job scheduler (L/F job scheduler) that considers locality together to solve problems of the even job scheduler that only considers fairness. First, the L/F job scheduler increases cohesion of contiguous tasks that require message transmissions for the locality. At the same time, it reduces coupling of parallel tasks that do not require message transmissions for the fairness. Next, we connect the contiguous tasks into a stream pipeline and evenly deploy stream pipelines to the distributed servers so that the L/F job scheduler achieves high cohesion and low coupling. Finally, we implement the proposed L/F job scheduler in Apache Storm, a representative DSPE, and evaluate it in both synthetic and real-world workloads. Experimental results show that the L/F job scheduler is similar in throughput compared to the even job scheduler, but latency is significantly improved by up to 139.2% for the LSP applications and by up to 140.7% even for the non-LSP applications. The L/F job scheduler also improves latency by 19.58% and 12.13%, respectively, in two real-world workloads. These results indicate that our L/F job scheduler provides superior processing performance for the DSPE applications.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000592988900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1857%26rft.atitle%3DLocality%252FFairness-Aware%2BJob%2BScheduling%2Bin%2BDistributed%2BStream%2BProcessing%2BEngines%26rft.aufirst%3DSiwoon%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DSon%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Felectronics9111857%26rft.eissn%3D2079-9292%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DELECTRONICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DELECTRONICS-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DSon%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DMoon%252C%2BYS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=ELECTRONICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/electronics9111857,"distributed processing,real-time processing,data stream,locality,fairness,job scheduling,stream partitioning",,,"Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Chuncheon Si 24341, Gangwon Do, South Korea"
31,31,"Atekwana, EA",Jul 2004 ,Investigating landfill-impacted groundwater seepage into headwater streams using stable carbon isotopes,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The impact of landfill contaminated groundwater along a reach of a small stream adjacent to a municipal landfill was investigated using stable carbon isotopes as a tracer. Groundwater below the stream channel, groundwater seeping into the stream, groundwater from the stream banks and stream water were sampled and analysed for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the isotope ratio of DIC (delta(13)C(DIC)). Representative samples of groundwater seeping into the stream were collected using a device (a 'seepage well') specifically designed for collecting samples of groundwater seeping into shallow streams with soft sediments. The DIC and delta(13)C(DIC) of water samples ranged from 52 to 205 mg C/L and -16(.)9 to +5(.)7parts per thousand relative to VPDB standard, respectively. Groundwater from the stream bank adjacent to the landfill and some samples of groundwater below the stream channel and seepage into the stream showed evidence of delta(13)C enriched DIC (delta(13)C(DIC) = -2(.)3 to +5(.)7parts per thousand), which we attribute to landfill impact. Stream water and groundwater from the stream bank opposite the landfill did not show evidence of landfill carbon (delta(13)C(DIC) = -10(.)0 to -16(.)9parts per thousand). A simple mixing model using DIC and delta(13)C(DIC) showed that groundwater below the stream and groundwater seeping into the stream could be described as a mixture of groundwater with a landfill carbon signature and uncontaminated groundwater. This study suggests that the hyporheic zone at the stream-groundwater interface probably was impacted by landfill contaminated groundwater and may have significant ecological implications for this ecotone.

The distribution of trace elements in water samples of the Bouregreg River and its tributaries was determined by measurements at 10 sampling sites. The data obtained show that the spectrum of normalized concentrations with regard to concentrations found at the reference station (site AGL1) have rather identical forms for sites located downstream in the river, wheres a certain dispersal was observed for sites situated upstream in the river (BLH, KSK1, KSK2, and AGL2). The concentrations of most elements are particularly low at the reference station (site AGL1). The elements Co, As, and Rb show a maximum concentration at the site AGL2 situated downstream of Aguelmous and close to a public discharge; this is explained by an anthropogenic origin for the concentrations of these elements.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000259600700003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDetermination%2Bof%2Btrace%2Belements%2Bin%2BBouregreg%2BRiver%2Bwater%2Bby%2Binductively%2Bcoupled%2Bplasma%2Bmass%2Bspectrometry%26rft.aufirst%3DO.%2BK.%26rft.auinit%3DOK%26rft.aulast%3DHakam%26rft.date%3D2008%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F00387010802286528%26rft.epage%3D272%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0038-7010%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DSPECTROSCOPY%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D267-272%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D267%26rft.stitle%3DSPECTROSC%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DHakam%252C%2BOK%26rft.au%3DBounouira%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DChakiri%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=SPECTROSCOPY+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/00387010802286528,"Bouregreg River,ICP-MS,multielement analysis trace elements","ICP-AES,WD-XRF,DRAINAGE",,"Univ Ibn Tofail, Equipe Phys & Tech Nucl, Lab Phys Matiere & Rayonnement, Fac Sci, Kenitra, Morocco"

Three datasets, including East Asia (EA), high-resolution gauge satellite-merged China Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMPA)-Daily, and the Asian Precipitation Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) daily precipitation were used to drive the CLHMS model to simulate daily hydrological processes from 1998 to 2006. The results indicate that the precipitation data was the most important source of uncertainty in the hydrological simulation. The simulated streamflow driven by the CMPA-Daily agreed well with observations, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PMC) greater than 0.70 and an index of agreement (IOA) similarity coefficient greater than 0.82 at Liuzhou, Shijiao, and Wuzhou Stations. Comparison of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) shows that the peak flow simulation ability of CLHMS driven with the CMPA-Daily rainfall is relatively superior to that with the EA and APHRODITE datasets. The simulation results for the high-flow periods in 1998 and 2005 indicate that the CLHMS is promising for its future application in the flood simulation and prediction.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000404559900029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B391%26rft.atitle%3DFlood%2BSimulations%2Band%2BUncertainty%2BAnalysis%2Bfor%2Bthe%2BPearl%2BRiver%2BBasin%2BUsing%2Bthe%2BCoupled%2BLand%2BSurface%2Band%2BHydrological%2BModel%2BSystem%26rft.aufirst%3DYongnan%26rft.auinit%3DYN%26rft.aulast%3DZhu%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw9060391%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DZhu%252C%2BYN%26rft.au%3DLin%252C%2BZH%26rft.au%3DWang%252C%2BQM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w9060391,"coupled land surface-hydrology model,flood simulation,uncertainty analysis,Pearl River Basin","DAILY PRECIPITATION,WATER-RESOURCES,DATASET,CHINA,IMPACTS",,"China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China"
34,34,"Taylor, CM",May 1997 ,Fish species richness and incidence patterns in isolated and connected stream pools: Effects of pool volume and spatial position,OECOLOGIA,"I tested the effects of pool size and spatial position (upstream or downstream) on fish assemblage attributes in isolated and-connected pools in an upland Oklahoma stream, United States. I hypothesized that there would be fundamental differences between assemblages in these two pool types due to the presence or absence of colonization opportunities. Analyses were carried out at three ecological scales. (1) the species richness of pool assemblages, (2) the species composition of pool assemblages, and (3) the responses of individual species. There were significant species-volume relationships for isolated and connected pools. However, the relationship was weaker and there were fewer species, on average, in isolated pools. For both pool types, species incidences were significantly nested such that species-poor pools tended to be subsets of species-rich pools, a common pattern that ultimately results from species-specific differences in colonization ability and/or extinction susceptibility. To examine the potential importance of these two processes in nestedness patterns in both pool types, I made the following two assumptions: (I) probability of extinction should decline with increasing pool size, and (2) probability of immigration should decline in an upstream direction (increasing isolation). When ordered by pool volume, only isolated pools were significantly nested suggesting that these assemblages were extinction-driven. When ordered by spatial position, only connected pools were significantly nested (more species downstream) suggesting that differences in species-specific dispersal abilities were important in structuring these assemblages. At the individual-species level, volume was a significant predictor of occurrence for three species in isolated pools. In connected pools, two species showed significant position effects, one species showed a pool volume effect, and one species showed pool volume and position effects. These results demonstrate that pool size and position within a watershed are important determinants of fish species assemblage structure, but their importance varies with the colonization potential of the pools. Isolated pool assemblages are similar to the presumed relaxed faunas of montane forest fragments and land bridge islands, but at much smaller space rind time scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1997XD21000017,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFish%2Bspecies%2Brichness%2Band%2Bincidence%2Bpatterns%2Bin%2Bisolated%2Band%2Bconnected%2Bstream%2Bpools%253A%2BEffects%2Bof%2Bpool%2Bvolume%2Band%2Bspatial%2Bposition%26rft.aufirst%3DCM%26rft.auinit%3DCM%26rft.aulast%3DTaylor%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs004420050196%26rft.epage%3D566%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-8549%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DOECOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D560-566%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D560%26rft.stitle%3DOECOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D110&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=OECOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s004420050196,"colonization,extinction,nestedness,species-volume relationship,stream fishes","ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,ASSEMBLAGES,EXTINCTION,SUBSETS,COLONIZATION,IMMIGRATION,HABITAT,FAUNAS,RATES",,"MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIV,DEPT BIOL SCI,MISSISSIPPI STATE,MS 39762, USA"
35,35,"Stewart, IT",Jan 2013 ,Connecting physical watershed characteristics to climate sensitivity for California mountain streams,CLIMATIC CHANGE,"California mountain streams provide critical water resources for human supplies and aquatic ecosystems, and have been affected by climatic changes to varying degrees, often within close proximity. The objective of this study is to examine stream flow timing changes and their climatic drivers through 2009, identify sub-regional patterns in response and sensitivity, and explore whether the differences in the sensitivity of a stream to climatic changes can be partially explained through the physical characteristics of a watershed. To this end, changes in streamflow timing for each watershed were assessed through several runoff timing measures, and overall sensitivity to historic climatic changes through a composite sensitivity index. Elevation, aspect, slope, geology, and landcover distributions, as well as climate information were assembled for each watershed; and were analyzed in conjunction with the sensitivity index. Results showed that the basins most sensitive to climatic changes are on the western Sierra Nevada slopes, while eastern and southern Sierra Nevada, as well as Klamath mountain watersheds exhibit little or no response to climatic shifts to date. Basin sensitivity was not found to be connected to any individual physical watershed characteristic other than elevation. However, it is suggested that basin-to-basin differences in sensitivity, observed in spite of regional-scale warming and similar watershed elevations, can be explained by differences in elevation ranges and combinations of physical watershed characteristics. Results about stream differences in climate sensitivity could aid in prioritizing stream preservation efforts.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000312632700008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConnecting%2Bphysical%2Bwatershed%2Bcharacteristics%2Bto%2Bclimate%2Bsensitivity%2Bfor%2BCalifornia%2Bmountain%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DIris%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DIT%26rft.aulast%3DStewart%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10584-012-0567-5%26rft.epage%3D148%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0165-0009%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DCLIMATIC%2BCHANGE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D133-148%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D133%26rft.stitle%3DCLIMATIC%2BCHANGE%26rft.volume%3D116&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=CLIMATIC+CHANGE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10584-012-0567-5,,"WESTERN UNITED-STATES,SAN-FRANCISCO ESTUARY,SIERRA-NEVADA,SNOWMELT RUNOFF,CHANGE SCENARIOS,NORTH-AMERICA,HYDROLOGY,IMPACTS,VARIABILITY,SHIFTS",,"Santa Clara Univ, Dept Environm Studies & Sci, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA"
36,36,"Krause, S",Jul 2011 ,Interstitial pore-water temperature dynamics across a pool-riffle-pool sequence,ECOHYDROLOGY,"Hyporheic habitat conditions are controlled strongly by spatial and temporal dynamics of physicochemical processes at the aquifer-river interface. In particular, heat transport between groundwater and surface water has a great impact on streambed habitats. This study uses high resolution observations of vertical hydraulic gradients (VHGs) and interstitial pore-water temperatures to investigate space-time patterns of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) exchange fluxes and streambed thermal conditions of a pool-riffle-pool sequence of a UK lowland river. The results indicate that, although groundwater is dominantly upwelling in the research area, exchange flow patterns are strongly influenced by the streambed geomorphology. Advective heat flux caused by groundwater upwelling is shown to have a moderating impact on interstitial temperature patterns and partly compensates the impact of conduction of diurnal surface water temperature fluctuations into the streambed. Consequently, diurnal temperature oscillations, which are clearly pronounced in the top 10 cm of the streambed (up to 2 degrees C) are reduced by >90% at depths below 20 cm. This study provides evidence that even in groundwater upwelling conditions, the spatially variable impact of heat conduction from the streambed surface may cause a spatially heterogeneous interstitial habitat structure with thermal conditions differing significantly in a vertical (3 degrees C temperature gradient at a length scale of 0.4 m) as well as longitudinal (0.75 degrees C at 16 m) domain.

37,37,"Zhou, D",Jul 1 2018 ,Numerical modelling of stream-aquifer interaction: Quantifying the impact of transient streambed permeability and aquifer heterogeneity,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Stream-aquifer interaction plays a vital role in the water cycle, and a proper study of this interaction is needed for understanding groundwater recharge, contaminants migration, and for managing surface water and groundwater resources. A model-based investigation of a field experiment in a riparian zone of the Schwarzbach river, a tributary of the Rhine River in Germany, was conducted to understand stream-aquifer interaction under alternative gaining and losing streamflow conditions. An equivalent streambed permeability, estimated by inverting aquifer responses to flood waves, shows that streambed permeability increased during infiltration of stream water to aquifer and decreased during exfiltration. Aquifer permeability realizations generated by multiple-point geostatistics exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity and anisotropy. A coupled surface water groundwater flow model was developed incorporating the time-varying streambed permeability and heterogeneous aquifer permeability realizations. The model was able to reproduce varying pressure heads at two observation wells near the stream over a period of 55days. A Monte Carlo analysis was also carried out to simulate groundwater flow, its age distribution, and the release of a hypothetical wastewater plume into the aquifer from the stream. Results of this uncertainty analysis suggest (a) stream-aquifer exchange flux during the infiltration periods was constrained by aquifer permeability; (b) during exfiltration, this flux was constrained by the reduced streambed permeability; (c) the effect of temporally variable streambed permeability and aquifer heterogeneity were found important to improve the accurate capture of the uncertainty; and (d) probabilistic infiltration paths in the aquifer reveal that such pathways and the associated prediction of the extent of the contaminant plume are highly dependent on aquifer heterogeneity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000437737700010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNumerical%2Bmodelling%2Bof%2Bstream-aquifer%2Binteraction%253A%2BQuantifying%2Bthe%2Bimpact%2Bof%2Btransient%2Bstreambed%2Bpermeability%2Band%2Baquifer%2Bheterogeneity%26rft.aufirst%3DDan%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DZhou%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13169%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D2292%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D14%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2279-2292%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2279%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DEngelhardt%252C%2BI&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.13169,"aquifer heterogeneity,groundwater age modelling,multiple-point geostatistics,stream-aquifer interaction,transient streambed permeability","RIVERBED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,MULTIPLE-POINT GEOSTATISTICS,SOLUTE-TRANSPORT,SURFACE-WATER,GROUNDWATER,SIMULATION,EXCHANGE,EQUATION,SYSTEM,FLUXES",,"Chengdu Univ Technol, Inst Environm, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China"

39,39,"Lu, Q",Dec 1 2016 ,Fate and transport of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the River Thames catchment - Insights from a coupled multimedia fate and hydrobiogeochemical transport model,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in riverine environments is strongly influenced by hydrology (including flooding) and fluxes of sediments and organic carbon. Coupling multimedia fate models (MMFMs) and hydrobiogeochemical transport models offers unique opportunities for understanding the environmental behaviour of POPs. While MMFMs are widely used for simulating the fate and transport of legacy and emerging pollutants, they use greatly simplified representations of climate, hydrology and biogeochemical processes. Using additional information about weather, river flows and water chemistry in hydrobiogeochemical transport models can lead to new insights about POP behaviour in rivers. As most riverine POPs are associated with suspended sediments (SS) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC), coupled models simulating SS and DOC can provide additional insights about POPs behaviour. Coupled simulations of river flow, DOC, SS and POP dynamics offer the possibility of improved predictions of contaminant fate and fluxes by leveraging the additional information in routine water quality time series. Here, we present an application of a daily time step dynamic coupled multimedia fate and hydrobiogeochemical transport model (The Integrated Catchment (INCA) Contaminants model) to simulate the behaviour of selected PCB congeners in the River Thames (UK). This is a follow-up to an earlier study where a Level III fugacity model was used to simulate PCB behaviour in the Thames. While coupled models are more complex to apply, we show that they can lead to much better representation of POPs dynamics. The present study shows the importance of accurate sediment and organic carbon simulations to successfully predict riverine PCB transport. Furthermore, it demonstrates the important impact of short-term-weather variation on PCB movement through the environment. Specifically, it shows the consequences of the severe flooding, which occurred in early 2014 on sediment PCB concentrations in the River Thames.

40,40,"Billett, MF",Jun 2 2006 ,Connecting organic carbon in stream water and soils in a peatland catchment,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"We investigated the spatial and temporal connectivity between concentrations of organic carbon in stream water and the soil carbon pool in a small ( 1.3 km(2)) upland catchment in NE Scotland by comparing downstream changes in dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) with spatial changes in the soil carbon pool. Stream water DOC concentrations increased downstream to reach a maximum in the center of the catchment and then decreased in the lower part of the catchment, a pattern that was linked to spatial changes in the soil carbon pool. Subcatchment analysis of the soil carbon pool and DOC export showed that the strong relationship between percent of peat coverage and stream water DOC in the upper part of the catchment did not hold farther downstream, where freely draining mineral soils become spatially more important. Temporal variations in stream water and soil water DOC concentrations in the central part of the catchment were studied using samples collected from two depths ( 0.20 - 0.45 m and 0.65 - 0.95 m) in the two most important soil types there ( histosols and fluvisols). Stream water DOC concentrations were only related to soil water DOC in shallow peat. DOC concentration in shallow peat and stream water were both positively correlated with temperature. Multivariate regression analysis showed that 55% of the variation in stream water DOC concentrations could be explained by a model including stream temperature, discharge, and soil solution DOC concentrations in the shallow histosols. We conclude that the linkage between stream water DOC concentrations and the soil C pool in the upper 1.5 km of the stream reach are likely to be driven by temperature-related DOC production in near-surface histosols. Farther downstream, this relationship between organic carbon in the soil and stream becomes weaker as other processes ( e. g., lower inputs from minerals soils and allochthonous within-stream processing of DOC) become more important.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000240990700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BG02010%26rft.atitle%3DConnecting%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bwater%2Band%2Bsoils%2Bin%2Ba%2Bpeatland%2Bcatchment%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BF.%26rft.auinit%3DMF%26rft.aulast%3DBillett%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2005JG000065%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3DG2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D111%26rft.au%3DBillett%252C%2BMF%26rft.au%3DDeacon%252C%2BCM%26rft.au%3DHope%252C%2BD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2005JG000065,,"DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES,PRECAMBRIAN SHIELD,NORTHEAST SCOTLAND,HEADWATER STREAM,UPLAND STREAMS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,RIVER WATER,MATTER,CHEMISTRY,WETLANDS",,"Edinburgh Res Stn, Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland"
41,41,"Ferencz, SB",Nov 2019 ,Analysis of the Effects of Dam Release Properties and Ambient Groundwater Flow on Surface Water-Groundwater Exchange Over a 100-km-Long Reach,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hydroelectric dams often create highly dynamic downstream flows that promote surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) interactions including bank storage, the temporary storage of river water in the riverbank. Previous research on SW-GW exchanges in dammed rivers has primarily been at single study sites, which has limited the understanding of how these exchanges evolve as dam releases travel downstream. This study evaluates how dam releases affect SW-GW exchange continuously over a 100-km distance. This is accomplished by longitudinally routing water releases through a synthetic river and modeling bed and bank fluid and solute exchange across transverse transects spaced along the reach. Peak and square dam release hydrograph shapes with three magnitudes (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 m) were considered. The effect of four ambient groundwater flow conditions (very slightly losing, neutral, and two gaining from the perspective of the river) was evaluated for each dam release scenario. Both types of dam release shapes cause SW-GW interaction over the entire 100-km distance, and our results show that square type releases cause bank storage exchange well beyond this distance. Strongly gaining conditions reduce the amount of exchange and allow flushing of river-sourced solute out of the bank after the dam pulse has passed. Both neutral and losing conditions have larger fluid and solute flux into the bank and limit the amount of solute that returns to the river. Our results support that river corridors downstream of dams have increased river-aquifer connectivity and that this enhanced connectivity can extend at least 100 km downstream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000494411100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAnalysis%2Bof%2Bthe%2BEffects%2Bof%2BDam%2BRelease%2BProperties%2Band%2BAmbient%2BGroundwater%2BFlow%2Bon%2BSurface%2BWater-Groundwater%2BExchange%2BOver%2Ba%2B100-km-Long%2BReach%26rft.aufirst%3DStephen%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DFerencz%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR025210%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D8546%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D8526-8546%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D8526%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DFerencz%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DNeilson%252C%2BBT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2019WR025210,"hydropeaking,surface water-groundwater interactions,modeling,dams,hyporheic,solute transport","BANK-STORAGE,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,RESIDENCE TIMES,RIVER,STREAM,AQUIFER,ZONE,SIMULATION,OPERATIONS,TRANSPORT",,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA"
42,42,"Peterson, EW",Sep 2021 ,"The Effectiveness of an Artificial Floating Wetland to Remove Nutrients in an Urban Stream: A Pilot-Study in the Chicago River, Chicago, IL USA",HYDROLOGY,"Ever expanding urbanized landscapes are increasingly impacting streams that run through them. Among other stressors, urban streams often are host to elevated concentrations of nutrients, salts, and heavy metals. The pollutants, coupled with high temperatures, are drivers of ecosystem degradation in urban streams. The installation of artificial floating wetlands (AFWs) has been successful in mitigating the effects of urbanization in lakes and wastewater treatment ponds, but rarely have they been tested in streams. This pilot-study examined the ability of an AFW to improve water quality in an urban stream. The small, 90 m(2) AFW was installed to improve the aquatic habitat and aesthetics of a small section of the Chicago River, Chicago, IL USA. Water samples and in-situ measurements were collected from the surface and at 0.3 m depth of upstream and downstream of the AFW. Samples were analyzed for nitrate-as-nitrogen, phosphate, chloride, and heavy metals. Comparison of upstream and downstream waters showed that the AFW lowered the concentrations of nitrate-as-nitrogen and phosphate during the growing season by 6.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Nitrate was also removed during the dormant season; however, phosphate was not removed during that time. Plant or microbial uptake of the nutrients are believed to be the dominant mechanisms in the growing season with denitrification serving as the primary pathway in the dormant season. Despite not having a measurable effect on the water temperature, the AFW was an effective means to reduce concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus, decreasing the potential for eutrophication.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000699478900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B115%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2BEffectiveness%2Bof%2Ban%2BArtificial%2BFloating%2BWetland%2Bto%2BRemove%2BNutrients%2Bin%2Ban%2BUrban%2BStream%253A%2BA%2BPilot-Study%2Bin%2Bthe%2BChicago%2BRiver%252C%2BChicago%252C%2BIL%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DEric%2BW.%26rft.auinit%3DEW%26rft.aulast%3DPeterson%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fhydrology8030115%26rft.eissn%3D2306-5338%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROLOGY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DPeterson%252C%2BEW%26rft.au%3DNicodemus%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DHeath%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/hydrology8030115,"artificial floating wetland,nitrate,phosphate,Chicago River,heavy metals","WATER-QUALITY,CONSTRUCTED WETLAND,NITRATE DYNAMICS,NITROGEN REMOVAL,WASTE-WATER,SEASONAL-VARIATION,RIPARIAN FORESTS,METAL,DENITRIFICATION,RETENTION",,"Illinois State Univ, Dept Geog Geol & Environm, Normal, IL 61790 USA"
43,43,"Arp, CD",Oct 15 2006 ,Surface-water hydrodynamics and regimes of a small mountain stream-take ecosystem,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The hydrology of streams and takes has been well. studied as separate ecosystems; however, the behavior and implications of hydrologic linkages between these ecosystems have been little considered. We analyzed the surface-water hydrodynamics of a stream-take ecosystem for 3 years in the Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho, USA to understand how this coupled aquatic ecosystem behaved hydrologically. This analysis included quantifying streamflow regimes above and below the take, the expansion and contraction of the Lake, stream, and floodplain, and downstream responses to snowmelt and rainstorm events. Our results showed that flow regime metrics from both hydrology and ecology were similar between above and betow-lake reaches, but analysis that considered channel capacity and overbank flooding showed 2x more frequent and > 5x longer duration floods below the take compared to upstream reaches. The take surface area expanded by as much as 19% during snowmelt runoff because of a 0.5 m rise in the take level, and the Littoral zone expanded by an even greater proportion. The take had little influence on peakflows during spring snowmelt, though the inlet stream in the delta had a reduced flood magnitude compared to upstream stations. However, during large summer rainstorms when potential storage capacity was maximized, the take strongly attenuated peakflows downstream from the take. Water level changes at seven other stream-take ecosystems in the region showed a similar range of variation.

The PAH mixture in the soils is mainly of low molecular weight compounds, with naphthalene (21.4%) and phenanthrene (21.8%) being dominant. Soil PAH levels from the Pearl River Delta are relatively low (28-711 ng/g, averaged 192 ng/g) compared to those from urban soils in temperate regions. The mean concentration of EPAHs generally decrease with increasing distance from the city center, with EPAHs of paddy soils > crop soil > natural soil. PAHs in the air were measured during a year-round sampling campaign using semipermeable membrane devices, and the transfer of chemicals between the soil and air compartments were estimated. Soil air fugacity quotient calculations showed a highly uncertain equilibrium position of PAHs, with net volatilization of naphthalene and fluorene, whereas net deposition of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene, indicating a capacity for the air to supply the soil with more substances.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000287982000063,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPAHs%2Bin%2Bsoils%2Band%2Bestimated%2Bair%2Bsoil%2Bexchange%2Bin%2Bthe%2BPearl%2BRiver%2BDelta%252C%2BSouth%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DGuoqing%26rft.auinit%3DGQ%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10661-010-1429-0%26rft.eissn%3D1573-2959%26rft.epage%3D870%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0167-6369%26rft.issue%3D1-4%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BMONITORING%2BAND%2BASSESSMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D861-870%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D861%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BMONIT%2BASSESS%26rft.volume%3D173%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BGQ%26rft.au%3DYu%252C%2BLL%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+MONITORING+AND+ASSESSMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10661-010-1429-0,"Soil,PAHs,Air soil exchange,Pearl River Delta,China","POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS,SEMIVOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS,ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES,AGRICULTURAL SOIL,CONTAMINANTS,GUANGZHOU,MODEL,ATMOSPHERE,PCBS",,"Shenzhen Univ, Inst Appl Nucl Technol, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China"
45,45,"Roberts, JJ",May 2013 ,Fragmentation and thermal risks from climate change interact to affect persistence of native trout in the Colorado River basin,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Impending changes in climate will interact with other stressors to threaten aquatic ecosystems and their biota. Native Colorado River cutthroat trout (CRCT; Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus) are now relegated to 309 isolated high-elevation (>1700m) headwater stream fragments in the Upper Colorado River Basin, owing to past nonnative trout invasions and habitat loss. Predicted changes in climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) and resulting changes in stochastic physical disturbances (i.e., wildfire, debris flow, and channel drying and freezing) could further threaten the remaining CRCT populations. We developed an empirical model to predict stream temperatures at the fragment scale from downscaled climate projections along with geomorphic and landscape variables. We coupled these spatially explicit predictions of stream temperature with a Bayesian Network (BN) model that integrates stochastic risks from fragmentation to project persistence of CRCT populations across the upper Colorado River basin to 2040 and 2080. Overall, none of the populations are at risk from acute mortality resulting from high temperatures during the warmest summer period. In contrast, only 37% of populations have a 90% chance of persistence for 70years (similar to the typical benchmark for conservation), primarily owing to fragmentation. Populations in short stream fragments <7km long, and those at the lowest elevations, are at the highest risk of extirpation. Therefore, interactions of stochastic disturbances with fragmentation are projected to be greater threats than warming for CRCT populations. The reason for this paradox is that past nonnative trout invasions and habitat loss have restricted most CRCT populations to high-elevation stream fragments that are buffered from the potential consequences of warming, but at risk of extirpation from stochastic events. The greatest conservation need is for management to increase fragment lengths to forestall these risks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000317284700005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFragmentation%2Band%2Bthermal%2Brisks%2Bfrom%2Bclimate%2Bchange%2Binteract%2Bto%2Baffect%2Bpersistence%2Bof%2Bnative%2Btrout%2Bin%2Bthe%2BColorado%2BRiver%2Bbasin%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DJJ%26rft.aulast%3DRoberts%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgcb.12136%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2486%26rft.epage%3D1398%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1354-1013%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DGLOBAL%2BCHANGE%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1383-1398%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1383%26rft.stitle%3DGLOBAL%2BCHANGE%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DRoberts%252C%2BJJ%26rft.au%3DFausch%252C%2BKD%26rft.au%3DHooten%252C%2BMB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=GLOBAL+CHANGE+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gcb.12136,"climate change,cutthroat trout,fragmentation,multiple stressors,native fish,stream temperature model,stream warming","EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE,WESTSLOPE CUTTHROAT TROUT,POTENTIAL HABITAT LOSS,BULL TROUT,WATER TEMPERATURE,SALMO-TRUTTA,BROOK TROUT,STREAM TEMPERATURES,TEMPORAL VARIATION,HEADWATER STREAMS",,"USGS Ft Collins Sci Ctr, 2150 Ctr Ave Bldg C, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA"
46,46,"Sarremejane, R",Jun 2017 ,Habitat connectivity and dispersal ability drive the assembly mechanisms of macroinvertebrate communities in river networks,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Metacommunity studies commonly use spatial distances or, more recently, landscape resistance measures between study sites as a surrogate for connectivity. However, local communities are connected to many other sources of colonisation than the sites included in a study, and the availability and distance to potential colonisation sources may be better surrogates for dispersal than distances to other sampling sites. Here we test the effect of habitat connectivity on the assembly of stream-riffle macroinvertebrates with different dispersal abilities, after controlling for habitat heterogeneity and among-site distances (62km on average). We used a null model approach to compare observed community dissimilarity to random expectation. Significant deviations from randomness were expected due to the hierarchical structure of river networks with their increasing flux of organisms from headwaters to mainstem reaches. We found a gradual shift in dispersal-based processes driving assembly mechanisms, from dispersal limitation in the isolated headwater streams to randomness in connected headwater and isolated mid-order streams, and to mass effects in the most connected mid-order streams. Weak flyers were constrained by dispersal limitation in the most isolated sites, whereas strong flyers were not restricted by the river network structure and were mainly assembled through mass effects. The approach taken was sufficient to unravel the importance of dispersal and habitat connectivity on community assembly and may therefore be particularly well suited to other large data sets with isolated sites (i.e. low geographical density of sites).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000400571200010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHabitat%2Bconnectivity%2Band%2Bdispersal%2Bability%2Bdrive%2Bthe%2Bassembly%2Bmechanisms%2Bof%2Bmacroinvertebrate%2Bcommunities%2Bin%2Briver%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DRomain%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DSarremejane%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffwb.12926%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1082%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1073-1082%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1073%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D62%26rft.au%3DSarremejane%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DMykra%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DMuotka%252C%2BT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/fwb.12926,"beta diversity,flying propensity,metacommunity,null models,streams","POPULATION GENETIC-STRUCTURE,ADULT AQUATIC INSECTS,BETA-DIVERSITY,METACOMMUNITY STRUCTURE,DENDRITIC CONNECTIVITY,OVERLAND DISPERSAL,STREAM INSECTS,PATTERNS,BIODIVERSITY,POOL",,"Univ Oulu, Dept Ecol & Genet, Oulu, Finland"

In the present paper, we propose two computational methods to construct the complex potentials for a uniform flow, a point vortex, a source and a sink in the multiply connected channel domains. First, we give analytic formulae of the potential flows in a special channel domain with circular holes, which are described in terms of the Schottky-Klein prime function as in Crowdy and Marshall [5]. Second, we make use of the numerical conformal mapping techniques by Amano [1] and Ogata [11] to approximate the complex potentials in the channel domains that contain boundaries of arbitrary shapes. We also confirm that the numerical techniques can be applied to construct the potential flows in a real river. The two methods provide us with analytic representations of the complex potentials, which enable us to compute the velocity field in the channel domains and the force on the boundaries quickly and accurately.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000311620300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNumerical%2BConstruction%2Bof%2BPotential%2BFlows%2Bin%2BMultiply%2BConnected%2BChannel%2BDomains%26rft.aufirst%3DTakashi%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DSakajo%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft.epage%3D438%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1617-9447%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DCOMPUTATIONAL%2BMETHODS%2BAND%2BFUNCTION%2BTHEORY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D415-438%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D415%26rft.stitle%3DCOMPUT%2BMETH%2BFUNCT%2BTH%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DSakajo%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DAmaya%252C%2BY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=COMPUTATIONAL+METHODS+AND+FUNCTION+THEORY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"Multiply connected,potential flows,channel domains,numerical conformal mapping",CHARGE SIMULATION METHOD,,"Hokkaido Univ, Dept Math, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan"

In managing and sustaining the level of water resource usage in any river catchment as well as when modelling hydrological processes, it is essential that the role of floodplain wetlands in stream flows is recognised and understood. Existing studies on hydrology within the Volta River basin have not adequately represented the variability of wetland hydrological processes and their contribution to the sustenance of river flow. In order to quantify the extent of floodwater storage within riparian wetlands and their contribution to subsequent river discharges, a series of complementary studies were conducted by utilising stable isotopes, physical monitoring of groundwater levels and numerical modelling. The water samples were collected near Pwalugu on the White Volta River and at three wetland sites adjacent to the river using the grab sampling technique. These were analysed for 18O and 2H. The analysis provided an estimate of the contribution of pre-event water to overall stream flow. In addition, the variation in the isotopic composition in the river and wetland water samples, respectively, revealed the pattern of flow and exchange of water between the wetlands and the main river system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000275532900008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DPII%2B919852355%26rft.atitle%3DUse%2Bof%2Bisotopes%2Bto%2Bstudy%2Bfloodplain%2Bwetland%2Band%2Briver%2Bflow%2Binteraction%2Bin%2Bthe%2BWhite%2BVolta%2BRiver%2Bbasin%252C%2BGhana%26rft.aufirst%3DBenjamin%2BKofi%26rft.auinit%3DBK%26rft.aulast%3DNyarko%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F10256010903388543%26rft.eissn%3D1477-2639%26rft.epage%3D106%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1025-6016%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DISOTOPES%2BIN%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BAND%2BHEALTH%2BSTUDIES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D91-106%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D91%26rft.stitle%3DISOT%2BENVIRON%2BHEALT%2BS%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DNyarko%252C%2BBK%26rft.au%3DEssumang%252C%2BDK%26rft.au%3DVlek%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D712gEzDqPOyeKascXlCVa&SrcJTitle=ISOTOPES+IN+ENVIRONMENTAL+AND+HEALTH+STUDIES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1080/10256010903388543,"Ghana,hydrogen-2,isotope ecology,oxygen-18,riparian wetlands,river,seasonal rainfall variations",WATER,,"Univ Cape Coast, Dept Chem, Cape Coast, Ghana"
49,49,"Tututi-Avila, S",Jul 12 2017 ,Design of an energy-efficient side-stream extractive distillation system,COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING,"A novel extractive distillation system is presented. The proposed separation system evolves from an extractive thermally coupled system with a side rectifier. Specifically, the modification involves substituting the thermal coupling, i.e., the vapor-liquid interconnection, by a liquid side stream fed to a modified second column of the arrangement. The design procedure and performance on energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the proposed structure is illustrated with three case studies, which involve bioethanol dehydration and the separation of acetone-methanol and heptane-toluene mixtures. The results show that the proposed system can be more energy efficient and provide a more sustainable option when compared to conventional extractive distillation or thermally coupled sequences. We also show how the implementation of heat integration between columns of the proposed structure can be considered for additional savings on energy and CO2 emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
