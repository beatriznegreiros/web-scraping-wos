0,"Gao, YQ",,Change of stream network connectivity under polder-type flood control measure,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Polder is usually used for flood control in the river delta area. With the rapid development of urbanization, the dikes or pumps cut the original stream network system, and the stream network connectivity (SNC) and the river system pattern have changed. The dikes or pumps generally force up the river's water level, and regional flood formation mechanisms and processes have changed. In order to quantitatively describe the characteristics of polder-type flood control measure (PFCM) and the change law of SNC, firstly, the streams inside polders were generalized as virtual streams, a hydrological-hydrodynamic model was constructed by connecting Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System and MIKE11 model. Secondly, an SNC evaluation model was constructed based on flow resistance and hydrological process. Finally, the SNC under different scenarios was simulated and evaluated to reveal the influence of the PFCM on SNC. And the dominance analysis method obtained the main control factors of SNC changes. The results showed that the pumps as the main drainage facility under the PFCM, SNC after the opening of the pumps were increased by 0.060, 0.103, and 0.311 for 50%, 30%, and 3% frequency flood scales compared with the pumps closed, respectively. However, compared with the natural stream (without the PFCM), the SNC decreased by 0.391, 0.456, and 0.487, respectively, at the same time of the same flood scale. The PFCM negatively impacted the SNC, and the number of pumps was the main control factor of the SNC.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000913313000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DChange%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%2Bconnectivity%2Bunder%2Bpolder-type%2Bflood%2Bcontrol%2Bmeasure%26rft.aufirst%3DYuqin%26rft.auinit%3DYQ%26rft.aulast%3DGao%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.13094%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.au%3DGao%252C%2BYQ%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BYP%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BSN&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
1,"Gu, CH",Sep 25 2012 ,Riparian biogeochemical hot moments induced by stream fluctuations,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Hyporheic exchanges in riparian zones induced by stream stage fluctuations, referred to as bank storage, can influence contaminant transport and transformation when mixing of groundwater and surface waters with distinct chemical signatures occur, which might lead to a high biochemical activity. The effect of bank storage on nutrient transport was analyzed here using a two-dimensional, variably saturated and multispecies reactive transport model, which accounted for the water flow and solute transport and reactions within riparian zones. After verification with field observations, our model demonstrated that high biogeochemical activities occurred at the near-stream riparian zone during stage fluctuation, a process referred to as bank storage hot moment (BSHM). We used Monte Carlo simulations to study the uncertainty of BSHM and related nutrient dynamics to biogeochemical and hydrological factors. The results indicated that stream fluctuations can lead to maximum bank storage volume ranging from 0 to 259 m(3) m(-1) of stream linear length (median = 9.7 m(3) and SD = 53.2 m(3)). Taking denitrification as an example, BSHM can lead to considerable NO3- removal with a median removal rate of 2.1 g d(-1) and SD of 17.2 g d(-1) per meter of stream linear length. The NO3- uptake velocity (median = 2.7 x 10(-5) and SD = 2.4 x 10(-4) m min(-1)) was comparable to that of in-stream transient storage from the literature. This result suggests that BSHM may be a significant process contributing to the nutrient budget at the ecosystem level. Finally, a theoretical framework representing the coupled hydrobiogeochemical controls on riparian hot spots was developed to help predicting when BSHM can become important in a particular stream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000309418900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW09546%26rft.atitle%3DRiparian%2Bbiogeochemical%2Bhot%2Bmoments%2Binduced%2Bby%2Bstream%2Bfluctuations%26rft.aufirst%3DChuanhui%26rft.auinit%3DCH%26rft.aulast%3DGu%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2011WR011720%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D48%26rft.au%3DGu%252C%2BCH%26rft.au%3DAnderson%252C%2BW%26rft.au%3DMaggi%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

This paper adopted the coupling coordination model, projection pursuit algorithm, and random forest model to explore the spatial-temporal evolution and influencing factors of the CC2E in the Yangtze River Delta from 2015 to 2019, respectively. The results showed that: (1) The degree of coupling coordination (DCC) of the CC2E in most cities of the Yangtze River Delta has risen from primary coordination to intermediate coordination. (2) In the spatial perspective, the distribution of DCC is correlated with geographical location. The value of DCC in the western region was significantly lower than that of the eastern cities. (3) The influencing factors results showed that the GDP in the economic subsystem and the annual average concentration of PM2.5 in the environmental subsystem were the most influencing factors of DCC in the Yangtze River Delta. The established index system of CC2E and the measurements of CC2E provide a new idea for how to achieve sustainable development.

4,"Huang, LJ",Apr 2021 ,Spatio-Temporal Coupling Characteristics and the Driving Mechanism of Population-Land-Industry Urbanization in the Yangtze River Economic Belt,LAND,"The purpose of this paper is to probe into the coupled coordination of urbanization in population, land, and industry to improve urbanization quality. A coupled coordination degree model, spatial analysis method and spatial metering model are employed. The study area is 110 prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The study shows that: (1) the coupling degree of the population-land-industry urbanization grew very slowly between 2006 and 2016. On the whole, the three-dimensional urbanization is in a running-in period, and land-based urbanization dominates, while population-based urbanization and industry-based urbanization are relatively lagging behind. (2) The three major urban agglomerations, the Chengdu-Chongqing, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yangtze River Delta, are parallel to the whole area in terms of the coupling degree of the three dimensional urbanization with a well-ordered structure, especially in the central cities of the three major urban agglomerations. (3) There is significant spatial correlation in the coupling degree and coordination degree of the three-dimensional urbanization. The high value of coupling degree and coordination degree are clustered continuously in developed cities, provincial capitals, and central cities of the downstream reaches of the Yangtze River. (4) The coordinated degree has significant positive spatial autocorrelation, showing obvious spatial agglomeration characteristics: H-H agglomeration areas are concentrated in the downstream developed areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. L-L agglomeration areas are mainly concentrated in upstream undeveloped areas, but the number of their cities shows a decreasing trend. (5) The coordination degree of the three-dimensional urbanization is the result of the comprehensive effect of economic development level, the government's decision-making behavior, and urban location. Among them, the economic development level, urbanization investment, traffic condition, and urban geographical location play a decisive role. This paper contributes to the existing literatures by exploring urbanization quality, spatial correlation and influencing factors from the perspectives of the three-dimensional urbanization in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The conclusion might be helpful to promote the coupling and coordinated development of urbanization in population-land-industry, and ultimately to improve urbanization quality in the Yangtze River Economic Belt.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000643245400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B400%26rft.atitle%3DSpatio-Temporal%2BCoupling%2BCharacteristics%2Band%2Bthe%2BDriving%2BMechanism%2Bof%2BPopulation-Land-Industry%2BUrbanization%2Bin%2Bthe%2BYangtze%2BRiver%2BEconomic%2BBelt%26rft.aufirst%3DLiejia%26rft.auinit%3DLJ%26rft.aulast%3DHuang%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fland10040400%26rft.eissn%3D2073-445X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DLAND%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DLAND-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BLJ%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DHu%252C%2BWY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=LAND&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

6,"Malki, R",Mar 1 2013 ,A coupled blade element momentum - Computational fluid dynamics model for evaluating tidal stream turbine performance,APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING,"A modelling approach based on blade element momentum theory is developed for the prediction of tidal stream turbine performance in the ocean environment. Through the coupling of the blade element momentum method with computational fluid dynamics, the influence of upstream hydrodynamics on rotor performance is accounted for. Incoming flow onto the rotor can vary in speed and direction compared to free-stream conditions due to the presence of obstructions to the flow in the upstream, due to other devices for example, or due to the complexity of natural bathymetries. The relative simplicity of the model leads to short run times and a lower demand on computational resources making it a useful tool for considering more complex engineering problems consisting of multiple tidal stream turbines. Results from the model compare well against both measured data from flume experiments and results obtained using the classical blade element momentum model.. A discussion considering the advantages and disadvantages of these different approaches is included. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

7,"Stegen, JC",Feb 8 2018 ,Influences of organic carbon speciation on hyporheic corridor biogeochemistry and microbial ecology,NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"The hyporheic corridor (HC) encompasses the river-groundwater continuum, where the mixing of groundwater (GW) with river water (RW) in the HC can stimulate biogeochemical activity. Here we propose a novel thermodynamic mechanism underlying this phenomenon and reveal broader impacts on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial ecology. We show that thermodynamically favorable DOC accumulates in GW despite lower DOC concentration, and that RW contains thermodynamically less-favorable DOC, but at higher concentrations. This indicates that GW DOC is protected from microbial oxidation by low total energy within the DOC pool, whereas RW DOC is protected by lower thermodynamic favorability of carbon species. We propose that GW-RW mixing overcomes these protections and stimulates respiration. Mixing models coupled with geophysical and molecular analyses further reveal tipping points in spatiotemporal dynamics of DOC and indicate important hydrology-biochemistry-microbial feedbacks. Previously unrecognized thermodynamic mechanisms regulated by GW-RW mixing may therefore strongly influence biogeochemical and microbial dynamics in riverine ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000424452200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B585%26rft.atitle%3DInfluences%2Bof%2Borganic%2Bcarbon%2Bspeciation%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bcorridor%2Bbiogeochemistry%2Band%2Bmicrobial%2Becology%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DJC%26rft.aulast%3DStegen%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1038%252Fs41467-018-02922-9%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2041-1723%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURE%2BCOMMUNICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BCOMMUN%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DStegen%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DJohnson%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DZachara%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=NATURE+COMMUNICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
8,"Higuera, M",Sep-oct 2002 ,Coupled amplitude-streaming flow equations for nearly inviscid Faraday waves in small aspect ratio containers,JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR SCIENCE,"We derive a set of asymptotically exact coupled amplitude-streaming flow (CASF) equations governing the evolution of weakly nonlinear nearly inviscid multimode Faraday waves and the associated streaming flow in finite geometries. The streaming flow is found to play a particularly important role near mode interactions. Such interactions come about either through a suitable choice of parameters or through breaking of degeneracy among modes related by symmetry. An example of the first case is provided by the interaction of two nonaxisymmetric modes in a circular container with different azimuthal wavenumbers. The second case arises when the shape of the container is changed from square to slightly rectangular, or from circular to slightly noncircular but with a plane of symmetry.

9,"Fan, JT",Oct 2018 ,"Priorization of River Restoration by Coupling Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Models in the Taizi River Basin, Northern China",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Identifying priority zones for river restoration is important for biodiversity conservation and catchment management. However, limited data due to the difficulty of field collection has led to research to better understand the ecological status within a catchment and develop a targeted planning strategy for river restoration. To address this need, coupling hydrological and machine learning models were constructed to identify priority zones for river restoration based on a dataset of aquatic organisms (i.e., algae, macroinvertebrates, and fish) and physicochemical indicators that were collected from 130 sites in September 2014 in the Taizi River, northern China. A process-based model soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was developed to model the temporal-spatial variations in environmental indicators. A support vector machine (SVM) model was applied to explore the relationships between aquatic organisms and environmental indicators. Biological indices among different hydrological periods were simulated by coupling SWAT and SVM models. Results indicated that aquatic biological indices and physicochemical indicators exhibited apparent temporal and spatial patterns, and those patterns were more evident in the upper reaches compared to the lower reaches. The ecological status of the Taizi River was better in the flood season than that in the dry season. Priority zones were identified for different hydrological seasons by setting the target values for ecological restoration based on biota organisms, and the results suggest that hydrological conditions significantly influenced restoration prioritization over other environmental parameters. Our approach could be applied in other seasonal river ecosystems to provide important preferences for river restoration.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000448818100032,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2090%26rft.atitle%3DPriorization%2Bof%2BRiver%2BRestoration%2Bby%2BCoupling%2BSoil%2Band%2BWater%2BAssessment%2BTool%2B%2528SWAT%2529%2Band%2BSupport%2BVector%2BMachine%2B%2528SVM%2529%2BModels%2Bin%2Bthe%2BTaizi%2BRiver%2BBasin%252C%2BNorthern%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DJuntao%26rft.auinit%3DJT%26rft.aulast%3DFan%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph15102090%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DFan%252C%2BJT%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BMD%26rft.au%3DWu%252C%2BFC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
10,"Flury, S",Jun 28 2019 ,Exploring the Sources of Unexpected High Methane Concentrations and Fluxes From Alpine Headwater Streams,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"The dynamics of methane generation and evasion from well-oxygenated, oligotrophic streams have been traditionally neglected. We estimated evasion of methane and assessed its sources and production pathways using a stable isotope approach in 16 oxygen-rich and C-poor (dissolved organic carbon: 55.32 +/- 57.56 mu mol/L) Alpine headwater streams. Methane was often supersaturated relative to the atmosphere (0.093 +/- 0.179 mu mol/L). Fluxes (0.87 +/- 1.34 mmol.m(-2).day(-1)) were unexpectedly high and comparable to those from high-latitude lakes and reservoirs. Our findings suggest that methane in the streambed was largely produced from carbon dioxide reduction, whereas acetoclastic pathways and major deliveries from adjacent soils, assessed from a mass balance, may have contributed to stream water methane. This study sheds new light on high-alpine streams as a hitherto unaccounted source of methane to the atmosphere.Plain Language Summary The greenhouse gas methane is naturally produced and emitted from organic matter rich freshwater ecosystems. Normally, this gas is produced in places where oxygen is absent. However, recent studies have shown that methane is also emitted from oxygen-rich rivers and streams. But the knowledge and understanding of the underlying processes that cause this paradox is currently poor. In this light, we investigated organic matter-poor and oxygen-rich Alpine streams to better understand the methane dynamics in those systems. We found that methane emissions from these streams are similar to emissions from organic-rich lakes and reservoirs at high latitudes, probably due to high gas exchange velocities in these steep environments. Methane that is found in the streambed of these streams is likely produced from inorganic carbon in oxygen-depleted sediment pockets, while in the stream water it likely originates mainly from adjacent soils. Headwater streams are most numerous in river networks worldwide, often organic matter poor and oxygen rich. Together with the strong potential for methane emissions, it is clear that Alpine streams should be considered in future methane emission budgets and knowledge about methane sources should be improved for effective mitigation of methane emissions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000477616300051,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DExploring%2Bthe%2BSources%2Bof%2BUnexpected%2BHigh%2BMethane%2BConcentrations%2Band%2BFluxes%2BFrom%2BAlpine%2BHeadwater%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DS.%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DFlury%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019GL082428%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D6625%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6614-6625%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6614%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DFlury%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DUlseth%252C%2BAJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
11,"Onusluel Gul, G",Mar 2010 ,Assessing climate change impacts on river flows and environmental flow requirements at catchment scale,ECOHYDROLOGY,"The fourth assessment report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests studies that increase the spatial resolution to solve the scale mismatch between large-scale climatic models and the catchment scale while addressing climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Impacts occur mostly at the local scale. though potential changes in the hydrological cycle and eco-hydrological processes are more difficult to model and analyse at this level. The difficulty is even greater for studies on lowland river systems, which require the modelling of hydrological processes in greater detail. In this Study, the regional impacts of climate change on river flow and environmental flow requirement. which is a negotiated trade-off between water uses, are analysed for a lowland catchment in Denmark through MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 coupling. The Coupled model possesses an important capacity for simulating stream flows and groundwater head levels in a dynamic system. Although the simulation results from different global circulation models (GCMs) indicate different responses in flows to the climate change, there are obvious deviations of the river flows and environmental flow potentials computed for all the scenario cases from the averages of the base period with current conditions.

12,"Federman, CE",Feb 2023 ,Impact of floodplain and Stage 0 stream restoration on flood attenuation and floodplain exchange during small frequent storms,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"River flooding impacts human life and infrastructure, yet provides habitat and ecosystem services. Traditional flood control (e.g., levees, dams) reduces habitat and ecosystem services, and exacerbates flooding elsewhere. Floodplain restoration (i.e., bankfull floodplain reconnection and Stage 0) can also provide flood management, but has not been sufficiently evaluated for small frequent storms. We used 1D unsteady Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System to simulate small storms in a 5 km-long, second-order generic stream from the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and varied % channel restored (starting at the upstream end), restoration location, restoration bank height (distinguishes bankfull from Stage 0 restoration), and floodplain width/Manning's n. Stream restoration decreased (attenuated) peak flow up to 37% and increased floodplain exchange by up to 46%. Floodplain width and % channel restored had the largest impact on flood attenuation. The incremental effects of new restoration projects on flood attenuation were greatest when little prior restoration had occurred. By contrast, incremental effects on floodplain exchange were greatest in the presence of substantial prior restoration, setting up a tradeoff. A similar tradeoff was revealed between attenuation and exchange for project location, but not bank height or floodplain width. In particular, attenuation and exchange were always greater for Stage 0 than for bankfull floodplain restoration. Stage 0 thus may counteract human impacts such as urbanization.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000877953500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DImpact%2Bof%2Bfloodplain%2Band%2BStage%2B0%2Bstream%2Brestoration%2Bon%2Bflood%2Battenuation%2Band%2Bfloodplain%2Bexchange%2Bduring%2Bsmall%2Bfrequent%2Bstorms%26rft.aufirst%3DCarly%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DCE%26rft.aulast%3DFederman%26rft.date%3D2023%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.13073%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D48%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D29-48%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D29%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D59%26rft.au%3DFederman%252C%2BCE%26rft.au%3DScott%252C%2BDT%26rft.au%3DHester%252C%2BET&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

14,"Song, XH",Sep 2020 ,River Dynamics Control Transit Time Distributions and Biogeochemical Reactions in a Dam-Regulated River Corridor,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Transit time distributions (TTDs) exert important controls on biogeochemical processes in watershed systems. TTDs are often assumed to follow time-invariant exponential, lognormal, or heavy-tailed power law distributions in headwater or low-order streams. However, under dynamic hydrological forcing, transit time could exhibit more complex distribution patterns with strong spatial and temporal variability. In this study, we used a numerical particle tracking approach to characterize TTDs along the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River under the influences of river stage fluctuations and evaluate the associated effects on biogeochemical reaction potentials within the river corridor. Particle tracking was conducted using velocity fields simulated by high-resolution three-dimensional groundwater flow models that capture both the river stage fluctuations and physical heterogeneity. Our results revealed that multifrequency flow variations led to multimodal TTDs that varied in time and space. Such characteristics can only be captured by multiyear numerical simulations supported by multiyear field monitoring. Dam-induced high-frequency (subweekly) flow variations increased additional hydrologic exchange flows with short (subweekly) transit times, which accounted for up to 44% of reactant consumption in the river corridor along the Hanford Reach. The dam-induced river stage fluctuations have more significant impacts on faster biogeochemical reactions because they cause a larger fraction of shorter transit times. Numerical particle tracking provides an efficient alternative for characterizing TTDs for large complex systems where in situ field experiments are not feasible. Such a numerical approach is thus essential for improving large-scale biogeochemical modeling from watersheds to basins.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000578452200022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2019WR026470%26rft.atitle%3DRiver%2BDynamics%2BControl%2BTransit%2BTime%2BDistributions%2Band%2BBiogeochemical%2BReactions%2Bin%2Ba%2BDam-Regulated%2BRiver%2BCorridor%26rft.aufirst%3DXuehang%26rft.auinit%3DXH%26rft.aulast%3DSong%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019WR026470%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BXH%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXY%26rft.au%3DHammond%252C%2BGE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
15,"Altaf, Y",Apr 2 2020 ,Modelling snowmelt runoff in Lidder River Basin using coupled model,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT,"A major proportion of discharge in the Udder River is contributed by snowmelt runoff in its catchment which is situated in the West Himalayan region. It is, therefore, quite essential to estimate the contribution of snowmelt runoff to discharge along with other hydrological components. The MIKE SHE-MIKE-11 integrated coupled model along with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing snow cover products was selected and used in the Lidder Basin to ascertain the snowmelt contribution to runoff along with baseflow and drainage, as well as the percentage of snow-covered areas in the Basin around the year. The model was calibrated by trying to match simulated discharge against observed stream flow discharge at the Sheeshnag gauging station. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying three unknown parameters, viz., degree day coefficient, temperature lapse rate and precipitation lapse rate. The three parameters were unknown in the region. The cumulative volume of the simulated runoff was further validated with the observed runoff which showed an excellent comparison. The snow-covered areas obtained from the output of the model were validated with the data obtained from MODIS data sets. The data showed an excellent comparison. The ET losses at Sheeshnag represented 19.65% of the total rainfall, while the runoff at the Sheeshnag catchment of the Lidder Basin represented 40% of the total rainfall. Snowmelt contribution to the total streamflow in the Lidder River at Sheeshnag was found to be 54.19%. The total error percentage of the model was about 0.11 of the total rainfall, indicating a good interaction among different hydrological components of the model. The results obtained suggest that the MIKESHE-MIKE-11 integrated coupled model can be used efficiently in the sub-catchments of the upper Indus Basin in which snowfall and snowmelt runoff are significant.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000477004200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DModelling%2Bsnowmelt%2Brunoff%2Bin%2BLidder%2BRiver%2BBasin%2Busing%2Bcoupled%2Bmodel%26rft.aufirst%3DYasir%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DAltaf%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1080%252F15715124.2019.1634082%26rft.eissn%3D1814-2060%26rft.epage%3D175%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1571-5124%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BRIVER%2BBASIN%2BMANAGEMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D167-175%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D167%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BRIVER%2BBASIN%2BMA%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DAltaf%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DAhangar%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DFahimuddin%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+RIVER+BASIN+MANAGEMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
16,"Zhang, JW",Dec 15 2018 ,Maximizing streaming efficiency of multiple streams in peer-to-peer networks,JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS,"Nowadays, multi-channel streaming and multi-file sharing are attracting increasing attention. To maximize the streaming efficiency of multiple streams, the multi-stream live streaming problem is studied from a practical point of view in this paper. The problem is modeled in a two-layer fully-connected network: the server network and the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. We first formulate the optimal non-forwarding (ONF) and optimal forwarding (OF) strategies into linear programs (LPs) to get the de facto upper bounds. Then, to facilitate the collaboration among servers while keeping as even load distribution as possible, we propose a novel water-filling (WF) algorithm that converts the original problem into solving a series of small linear systems (LSs). The WF algorithm proves to be of near-optimal efficiency and pretty low time complexity. Finally, we evaluate the obtained theoretical bounds, strategies and algorithm with key parameters, such as the bandwidths of the servers and P2P nodes, and the P2P network size. To expand the applicability, we also briefly discuss how to extend the proposed solutions to general networks. The flow-based method that we use is insightful for studying the intrinsic features of the problems related to multiple streams, and the obtained results are expected to be widely used for content distribution in datacenter networks (DCNs) and P2P networks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000453494900008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMaximizing%2Bstreaming%2Befficiency%2Bof%2Bmultiple%2Bstreams%2Bin%2Bpeer-to-peer%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DJianwei%26rft.auinit%3DJW%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jnca.2018.09.021%26rft.eissn%3D1095-8592%26rft.epage%3D120%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1084-8045%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BNETWORK%2BAND%2BCOMPUTER%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D108-120%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D108%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BNETW%2BCOMPUT%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D124%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BJW%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BXC%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BCL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+NETWORK+AND+COMPUTER+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

18,"Vallaeys, V",Apr 2018 ,Discontinuous Galerkin modeling of the Columbia River's coupled estuary-plume dynamics,OCEAN MODELLING,"The Columbia River (CR) estuary is characterized by high river discharge and strong tides that generate high velocity flows and sharp density gradients. Its dynamics strongly affects the coastal ocean circulation. Tidal straining in turn modulates the stratification in the estuary. Simulating the hydrodynamics of the CR estuary and plume therefore requires a multi-scale model as both shelf and estuarine circulations are coupled. Such a model has to keep numerical dissipation as low as possible in order to correctly represent the plume propagation and the salinity intrusion in the estuary. Here, we show that the 3D baroclinic discontinuous Galerkin finite element model SLIM 3D is able to reproduce the main features of the CR estuary-to-ocean continuum. We introduce new vertical discretization and mode splitting that allow us to model a region characterized by complex bathymetry and sharp density and velocity gradients. Our model takes into account the major forcings, i.e. tides, surface wind stress and river discharge, on a single multi-scale grid. The simulation period covers the end of spring-early summer of 2006, a period of high river flow and strong changes in the wind regime. SLIM 3D is validated with in-situ data on the shelf and at multiple locations in the estuary and compared with an operational implementation of SELFE. The model skill in the estuary and on the shelf indicate that SLIM 3D is able to reproduce the key processes driving the river plume dynamics, such as the occurrence of bidirectional plumes or reversals of the inner shelf coastal currents.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000427635500008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDiscontinuous%2BGalerkin%2Bmodeling%2Bof%2Bthe%2BColumbia%2BRiver%2527s%2Bcoupled%2Bestuary-plume%2Bdynamics%26rft.aufirst%3DValentin%26rft.auinit%3DV%26rft.aulast%3DVallaeys%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ocemod.2018.02.004%26rft.eissn%3D1463-5011%26rft.epage%3D124%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1463-5003%26rft.jtitle%3DOCEAN%2BMODELLING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D111-124%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D111%26rft.stitle%3DOCEAN%2BMODEL%26rft.volume%3D124%26rft.au%3DVallaeys%252C%2BV%26rft.au%3DKarna%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DHanert%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=OCEAN+MODELLING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
19,"Bogan, MT",May 2013 ,Flow intermittency alters longitudinal patterns of invertebrate diversity and assemblage composition in an arid-land stream network,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Temporary streams comprise a large proportion of the total length of most stream networks, and the great majority of arid-land stream networks, so it is important to understand their contribution to biotic diversity at both local and landscape scales. 2. In late winter 2010, we sampled invertebrate assemblages in 12 reaches of a large arid-land stream network (including perennial and intermittent headwaters, intermittent middle reaches and perennial rivers) in south-east Arizona, U.S.A. Intermittent reaches had then been flowing for c.60days, following a dry period of more than 450days. We sampled a subset of the perennial study reaches three more times between 2009 and 2011. Since intermittent reaches were dry during these additional sampling periods, we used assemblage data from two other intermittent streams in the study network (sampled in 200405 and 2010) to explore interannual variability in intermittent stream assemblage composition. 3. Invertebrate richness was lowest in intermittent reaches, despite their often being connected to species-rich perennial reaches. The assemblages of these intermittent reaches were not simply a subset of the species in perennial streams, but rather were dominated by a suite of stoneflies, blackflies and midges with adaptations to intermittency (e.g. egg and/or larval diapause). On average, 86% of individuals in these samples were specialists or exclusive to intermittent streams. Predators were 714 times more abundant in perennial than in intermittent reaches. 4. Despite being separated by long distances (1225km) and having very different physical characteristics, the assemblages of perennial headwaters and rivers were more similar to one another than to intervening intermittent reaches, emphasising the prime importance of local hydrology in this system. 5. The duration and recurrence intervals of dry periods, and the relative importance of dispersal from perennial refuges, probably influence the magnitude of biological differences between neighbouring perennial and temporary streams. Although perennial headwaters supported the highest diversity of invertebrates, intermittent reaches supported a number of unique or locally rare species and as such contribute to regional species diversity and should be included in conservation planning.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000317625900014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFlow%2Bintermittency%2Balters%2Blongitudinal%2Bpatterns%2Bof%2Binvertebrate%2Bdiversity%2Band%2Bassemblage%2Bcomposition%2Bin%2Ban%2Barid-land%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DMT%26rft.aulast%3DBogan%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffwb.12105%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D1028%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1016-1028%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1016%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D58%26rft.au%3DBogan%252C%2BMT%26rft.au%3DBoersma%252C%2BKS%26rft.au%3DLytle%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
20,"Anderson, WP",Nov 8 2010 ,"Changes in stream temperatures in response to restoration of groundwater discharge and solar heating in a culverted, urban stream",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Boone Creek is a mountainous headwater stream that lies within an urbanized environment in northwestern North Carolina. The primary source of thermal pollution in Boone Creek is the urban infrastructure, which affects stream temperatures through (1) heated runoff, which creates temperature surges and (2) the elimination of groundwater-surface water interactions. In this study, we use a Monte Carlo thermal mixing model to predict the thermal impact of removing a 700-m-long culvert. Our thermal mixing model balances stream discharge and temperatures with surface-heat exchange parameters and restored baseflow. We calculate the daily-average groundwater discharge velocity at 15 locations in the stream using signal decay in streambed temperatures, and utilize a Monte Carlo implementation of the heterogeneous baseflow field in the thermal mixing model. We also calculate surface-heat exchange per unit area for conditions upstream and downstream of the existing culvert and utilize those values in the thermal mixing model. Our modeled temperatures suggest a decrease in summer stream temperatures downstream of the culvert that average 1.35 degrees C and 1.17 degrees C for upstream and downstream surface-heat exchange conditions, respectively. The results of our study have implications for the balance between baseflow and the urban infrastructure in any high-gradient urban stream that experiences similar thermal effects.

The majority of variation in fish assemblages occurred from east to west and along a stream size gradient. After controlling for the influences of longitude and stream size, distance of sample sites from streams >= 5th order accounted for a small proportion of taxonomic variability. However, species richness was significantly higher and assemblage structure was different in tributary stream segments directly connected to larger-ordered streams, suggesting that the effects of spatial position within this stream network were greatest in close proximity to tributary-mainstem confluences. Fish collections from three intensively sampled tributaries also indicated an abrupt change in species assemblages between mainstem river sites and tributary sample sites above confluences, followed by a gradual taxonomic change with increasing distance up to 20 km from the confluence. Changes in fish assemblages were associated with the reduced abundance of adult stream species near the confluence with the mainstem, rather than the occurrences of riverine species in the tributary.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000273522300013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bspatial%2Bpositioning%2Bwithin%2Bstream%2Bnetworks%2Bon%2Bfish%2Bassemblage%2Bstructure%2Bin%2Bthe%2BKansas%2BRiver%2Bbasin%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DDarren%2BJ.%26rft.auinit%3DDJ%26rft.aulast%3DThornbrugh%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1139%252FF09-169%26rft.epage%3D156%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0706-652X%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DCANADIAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BFISHERIES%2BAND%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D143-156%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D143%26rft.stitle%3DCAN%2BJ%2BFISH%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D67%26rft.au%3DThornbrugh%252C%2BDJ%26rft.au%3DGido%252C%2BKB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=CANADIAN+JOURNAL+OF+FISHERIES+AND+AQUATIC+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
22,"Bendaoud, AM",Jan 2 2021 ,Assessment of subsurface riverbed clogging by fine sediments in a semi-arid catchment of north-western Algeria,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE,"In semi-arid regions, natural and anthropogenic disturbances increase the input of fine particles and their subsequent accumulation in streambeds sediment. The clogging of streambeds sediment is caused by the infiltration of fine particles at depth, reducing hydraulic conductivity (K) and hyporheic flow. Grain-size distribution and streambed vertical K were estimated using hyporheic sediment samples collected from ten stations in the Tafna River catchment during two hydrological periods of high and low water in order to investigate spatiotemporal variations and the variables influencing hydraulic conductivity. During the wet season, the upstream part of the catchment had significantly higher coarse sand content, with K measured to be three times greater than downstream. During low flow periods, there were significantly more fine particles (clay and silt) downstream, which were negatively correlated with K. Increases in clay and silt were the main cause of sediment clogging in the downstream part of catchment. However, within-group PCA showed that geomorphology had no significant influence on hyporheic sediment clogging. This study demonstrated that the process of streambed sediment clogging was influenced by the accumulation of fine particles and organic matter, which significantly contributed to the clogging of the downstream hyporheic zone, thus decreasing hydraulic conductivity despite prevailing geomorphology.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000587533500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAssessment%2Bof%2Bsubsurface%2Briverbed%2Bclogging%2Bby%2Bfine%2Bsediments%2Bin%2Ba%2Bsemi-arid%2Bcatchment%2Bof%2Bnorth-western%2BAlgeria%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DBendaoud%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2989%252F16085914.2020.1719814%26rft.eissn%3D1727-9364%26rft.epage%3D66%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1608-5914%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DAFRICAN%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BAQUATIC%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D54-66%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D54%26rft.stitle%3DAFR%2BJ%2BAQUAT%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D46%26rft.au%3DBendaoud%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DHaddou%252C%2BKA%26rft.au%3DBelaidi%252C%2BNO&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=AFRICAN+JOURNAL+OF+AQUATIC+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
23,"Riml, J",Aug 1 2013 ,Evaluating the fate of six common pharmaceuticals using a reactive transport model: Insights from a stream tracer test,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Quantitative information regarding the capacity of rivers to self-purify pharmaceutical residues is limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present a methodology for quantifying the governing processes affecting the fate of pharmaceuticals in streaming waters and, especially, to evaluate their relative significance for tracer observations. A tracer test in Sava Brook, Sweden was evaluated using a coupled physical-biogeochemical model framework containing surface water transport together with a representation of transient storage in slow/immobile zones of the stream, which are presumably important for the retention and attenuation of pharmaceuticals. To assess the key processes affecting the environmental fate of the compounds, we linked the uncertainty estimates of the reaction rate coefficients to the relative influence of transformation and sorption that occurred in different stream environments. The hydrological and biogeochemical contributions to the fate of the pharmaceuticals were decoupled, and the results indicate a moderate hydrological retention in the hyporheic zone as well as in the densely vegetated parts of the stream. Biogeochemical reactions in these transient storage zones further affected the fate of the pharmaceuticals, and we found that sorption was the key process for bezafibrate, metoprolol, and naproxen, while primary transformation was the most important process for clofibric acid and ibuprofen. Conversely, diclofenac was not affected by sorption or transformation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

24,"Wang, JF",Jun 28 2022 ,The Dominant Role of the Water Column in Nitrogen Removal and N2O Emissions in Large Rivers,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Rivers are important sites for nitrogen (N) cycling processes. N removal is thought to occur predominantly in the benthic zone and the role of the water column is frequently neglected. Here, we find that the water-air and sediment-water fluxes of N-2 and N2O decreased, while the water column production increased with stream order through 4-year observations across six river networks in China. The water column contribution increased with stream order and accounted for more than 50% in rivers above fifth order. The increase in the contact area of suspended sediment (SPS)-water caused by higher SPS concentrations and river depths resulted in the shift as river size increased. N removal and N2O emissions would be underestimated approximately by 50% if neglecting water column processes for the six river networks.

25,"Sumaiya, S",May 2021 ,Sediment Transport Potential in a Hydraulically Connected River and Floodplain-Channel System,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Meandering river floodplains often contain intermittently flooded complex channel networks. Many questions remain as to the pervasiveness, function, and evolution of these floodplain channels. In this present work, we analyzed size-specific sediment transport potential and assessed whether the channelized floodplain of the meandering East Fork White River near Seymour, Indiana is on a net erosional or depositional trajectory. We applied a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model and used simulated model results to estimate the largest sediment size that can be moved in suspension and as bedload at various flows for grain size classes between 4 mu m and 64 mm. We developed a probabilistic method that integrates the largest sediment size that can be moved at various flows to compute an effective grain size, which we compared to measured field data. Results show that the river is capable of supplying sand to the floodplain and these floodplain channels can transport sand in suspension and gravel as bedload. This suggests that sediment supplied from the river could be transported as bedload in floodplain channels. These floodplain channels are supply limited under the current hydrologic regime and the grain size distribution of the bed surface is set by the flow conditions; thus, these floodplain channels are net erosional. Finally, our proposed method of probabilistically integrating the largest sediment size that can be moved at various flows can be used to predict the upper end of the grain size distribution in suspension and in bed material, which is applicable to floodplains as well as coastal areas.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000654464300014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028852%26rft.atitle%3DSediment%2BTransport%2BPotential%2Bin%2Ba%2BHydraulically%2BConnected%2BRiver%2Band%2BFloodplain-Channel%2BSystem%26rft.aufirst%3DSumaiya%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DSumaiya%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028852%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DSumaiya%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DCzuba%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DEdmonds%252C%2BDA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

27,"Chi, YT",Nov 2021 ,Assessment of Extreme Storm Surges over the Changjiang River Estuary from a Wave-Current Coupled Model,JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,"Disastrous storm surges and waves caused by typhoons are major marine dynamic disasters affecting the east China coast and the Changjiang River Estuary, especially when they occur coincidentally. In this study, a high-resolution wave-current coupled model consisting of ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation) and SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) was established and validated. The model shows reasonable skills in reproducing the surge levels and waves. The storm surges and associated waves are then simulated for 98 typhoons affecting the Changjiang River Estuary over the past 32 years (1987-2018). Two different wind fields, the ERA reanalysis and the ERA-based synthetic wind with a theoretical typhoon model, were adopted to discern the potential uncertainties associated with winds. Model results forced by the ERA reanalysis show comparative skills with the synthetic winds, but differences may be relatively large in specific stations. The extreme surge levels with a 50-year return period are then presented based on the coupled model results and the Gumbel distribution model. Higher risk is presented in Hangzhou Bay and the nearshore region along the coast of Zhejiang. Comparative runs with and without wave effects were conducted to discern the impact of waves on the extreme surge levels. The wave setup contributes to 2-12.5% of the 50-year extreme surge level. Furthermore, the joint exceedance probabilities of high surge levels and high wave height were evaluated with the Gumbel-logistic statistic model. Given the same joint return period, the nearshore region along the coast of Zhejiang is more vulnerable with high surges and large waves than the Changjiang River Estuary with large waves and moderate surges.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000725436000001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1222%26rft.atitle%3DAssessment%2Bof%2BExtreme%2BStorm%2BSurges%2Bover%2Bthe%2BChangjiang%2BRiver%2BEstuary%2Bfrom%2Ba%2BWave-Current%2BCoupled%2BModel%26rft.aufirst%3DYutao%26rft.auinit%3DYT%26rft.aulast%3DChi%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fjmse9111222%26rft.eissn%3D2077-1312%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BMARINE%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BMAR%2BSCI%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DChi%252C%2BYT%26rft.au%3DRong%252C%2BZR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+MARINE+SCIENCE+AND+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
28,"Konrad, CP",Aug 18 2006 ,Longitudinal hydraulic analysis of river-aquifer exchanges,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[ 1] A longitudinal analysis of transient flow between a river and an underlying aquifer is developed to calculate flow rates between the river and the aquifer and the location of groundwater seepage into the river as it changes over time. Two flow domains are defined in the analysis: an upstream domain of fluvial recharge, where water flows vertically from the river into the unsaturated portion of the aquifer and horizontally in saturated parts of the aquifer, and a downstream domain of groundwater seepage to the river, where groundwater flows parallel to the underlying impermeable base. The river does not necessarily penetrate completely through the aquifer. A one-dimensional, unsteady flow equation is derived from mass conservation, Darcy's law, and the geometry of the river-aquifer system to calculate the water table position and the groundwater seepage rate into the river. Models based on numerical and analytical solutions of the flow equation were applied to a reach of the Methow River in north central Washington. The calibrated models simulated groundwater seepage with a root-mean-square error less than 5% of the mean groundwater seepage rates for three low-flow evaluation periods. The analytical model provides a theoretical basis for a nonlinear exponential base flow recession generated by a draining aquifer, but not an explicit functional form for the recession. Unlike cross-sectional approaches, the longitudinal approach allows the analysis of the length and location of groundwater seepage to a river, which have important ecological implications in many rivers. In the numerical simulations, the length of the groundwater seepage varied seasonally by about 4 km and the upstream boundary of groundwater seepage was within 689 m of its location at a stream gage on 9 September 2001 and within 91 m of its location on 6 October 2002. To demonstrate its utility in ecological applications, the numerical model was used to calculate differences in length of groundwater seepage to the Methow River under an early runoff scenario and the timing of those differences with respect to life stages of chinook salmon.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000239995700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW08425%26rft.atitle%3DLongitudinal%2Bhydraulic%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Briver-aquifer%2Bexchanges%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DCP%26rft.aulast%3DKonrad%26rft.date%3D2006%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2005WR004197%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D42&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Some were abandoned several millennia ago and can be used as evidence for past fluvial patterns. Despite many observations of changes undergone by meandering rivers, little is known about long-term morphological adjustment of meanders. This paper reports on investigations conducted in two reaches located in the middle valley of the Cher River (northwestern Europe, France) to examine the readjustments of lowland meanders during the second half of the Holocene. The aim of our study was to provide new insights into the complex dynamics that control low-energy meandering rivers. LiDAR DEM spatial analyses coupled with geophysical surveys and observations of sediments enabled the identification and dating of thirteen palaeomeanders embedded in coarse sediments (sand and gravel) while the whole floodplain is covered by silty overbank deposits. Sedimentological, geochemical and pollen analyses combined with radiocarbon and OSL dating allowed us to reconstruct the chronology of the cutoff and the filling of palaeochannels. No palaeochannels older than ca 6000 yr cal. BP, and no palaeochannels younger than the eleventh-thirteenth centuries cal. AD were identified. This allowed us to distinguish two periods of meandering processes. (1) Our observations demonstrate the multi-millennia persistence of an active meandering pattern in a context of land use changes (ca 6000 yr cal. BP-eleventh-thirteenth centuries cal. AD). The preserved mobility of the river can be mainly interpreted as the result of the low cohesiveness of the bank material. Too few fine sediments were delivered during the proto-historical and historical periods to help stabilize the river course. (2) Following the eleventh-thirteenth centuries cal. AD, the fluvial system underwent a laterally stable phase. The many medieval and modern hydraulic engineering works reduced the specific stream power and prevented lateral erosion. The drastic decrease in the river's capacity to generate new meanders resulted in the disappearance of floodplain lakes and loss of habitat diversity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

31,"Carlson, SP",,Influences of stream ecosystem respiration on stream network denitrification: Results from a simulation modeling experiment,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Denitrification can remove substantial amounts of NO3- from stream networks, but controls on the magnitude and distribution of network-scale denitrification remain poorly understood. Prior research using an empirical relationship between stream [NO3-] and denitrification efficiency to construct a stream network denitrification model suggested that smaller, lower order streams contributed disproportionately to whole-network NO3- removal when NO3- loads were low. We expanded this model by incorporating an empirical relationship between whole-stream aerobic respiration rate and denitrification efficiency, which decreased the simulated sensitivity of NO3- removal to [NO3-] and displayed additional heterogeneity in NO3- removal associated with variation in respiration rates. We explored the sensitivity of the expanded model across a set of scenarios representing variation in stream respiration and NO3--loading rates. Stream respiration rates used in these scenarios were determined from a theoretical relationship between aerobic respiration rate and stream temperature and were calculated for model scenarios representing warm (high respiration rate) and cool (low respiration rate) conditions. Our results indicated that reach- and network-scale denitrification is apt to be strongly influenced by respiration rates when NO3- supplies are high relative to removal rates. Therefore, the distribution of respiration rates across stream networks likely plays a more important role in determining spatial patterns of denitrification rates than previously described, highlighting a mechanism by which larger (higher order) streams may contribute substantially to whole-network denitrification.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000805219200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluences%2Bof%2Bstream%2Becosystem%2Brespiration%2Bon%2Bstream%2Bnetwork%2Bdenitrification%253A%2BResults%2Bfrom%2Ba%2Bsimulation%2Bmodeling%2Bexperiment%26rft.aufirst%3DSamuel%2BP.%26rft.auinit%3DSP%26rft.aulast%3DCarlson%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F720720%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.au%3DCarlson%252C%2BSP%26rft.au%3DPoole%252C%2BGC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

33,"Pate, AA",Nov 15 2020 ,Streamflow permanence in headwater streams across four geomorphic provinces in Northern California,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Mountainous headwater streams represent a substantial proportion of the global stream network. These small streams may flow episodically, seasonally, or perennially, providing diverse values and services. Given their broad importance and growing pressures on terrestrial and aquatic resources, we must improve our understanding of the drivers of flow permanence to facilitate informed land and water management decisions. We used field observations from >10 cross-sections in each of 101 non-fish bearing, headwater streams across four geomorphic provinces in Northern California to quantify flow permanence and network connectivity during the summer low flow period in 2018. At each stream cross-section, we noted the presence or absence of streamflow and used this information to classify streams as perennial (continuous streamflow in all cross-sections) or non-perennial and connected (surface water in the most downstream cross-section) or disconnected. At each cross-section, we also quantified channel size (width and depth) and grain size. We coupled field observations with geospatial data of catchment physiography, hydrology, and climate in random forest models to investigate controls of flow permanence and network connectivity. Potential drivers of flow permanence or network connectivity included in our models were channel geometry, grain size, slope, aspect, elevation, annual and seasonal precipitation, air temperature, and topographic wetness index. We found more perennial streams in the Klamath Mountains and Sierra Nevada than in the Cascades and N. Coast regions. Streams in the Klamath were the most connected followed by streams in the N. Coast, Sierra Nevada, and Cascades. The most important variables for predicting flow permanence were channel grain size, winter 2018 precipitation, and drainage area. Comparatively, the most important variables for predicting network connectivity were winter and spring 2018 precipitation, grain size, and bankfull depth. Our study illustrated the complexity of the processes that drive flow permanence and highlighted the uncertainty in projecting the precense of water in streams across diverse regions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000567907800001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStreamflow%2Bpermanence%2Bin%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%2Bacross%2Bfour%2Bgeomorphic%2Bprovinces%2Bin%2BNorthern%2BCalifornia%26rft.aufirst%3DAdam%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DAA%26rft.aulast%3DPate%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.13889%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D4504%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D23%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4487-4504%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4487%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DPate%252C%2BAA%26rft.au%3DSegura%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DBladon%252C%2BKD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
34,"Doering, M",Mar 2013 ,"Vertical hydrological exchange, and ecosystem properties and processes at two spatial scales along a floodplain river (Tagliamento, Italy)",FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"We examined the effect of vertical hydrological exchange on physicochemical variables, periphyton biomass (ecosystem properties), and sediment respiration (ecosystem process) at 2 spatial scales along a large gravel-bed river (Tagliamento River, northeastern Italy). At the regional scale, we investigated a 29-km-long, expanding and contracting, losing (average flow decrease 2.5 m(3) s(-1) km(-1)) and a 12.5-km-long, stable, gaining (average increase 0.3 m(3) s(-1) km(-1)) reach. At the local scale, we sampled riffle head and riffle tail units nested within the losing and gaining reaches. At the regional scale, we characterized vertical exchange by strong downwelling (negative vertical hydraulic gradient; VHG) in the losing and moderate upwelling (positive VHG) in the gaining reach. Nutrients, such as NO3-N and dissolved N (DN), and periphyton biomass (AFDM) showed a significantly (p < 0.05) lower concentration in the losing than in the gaining reach. A contrasting pattern emerged for sediment respiration. Expansion and contraction dynamics (i.e., drying and rewetting) in the losing reach negatively affected chlorophyll a and AFDM. At the local scale, VHG was negative at riffle heads and positive at riffle tails nested in the gaining reach, but variables did not respond to vertical exchange at riffle heads and riffle tails in the losing or gaining reach. However, averaged data from riffle heads and riffle tails in the losing reach compared to averaged data for riffle heads and riffle tails in the gaining reach showed the same pattern as found in the regional investigation. Vertical exchange was apparently a major factor influencing ecosystem properties and ecosystem processes hierarchically across different spatial scales.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000314670800002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DVertical%2Bhydrological%2Bexchange%252C%2Band%2Becosystem%2Bproperties%2Band%2Bprocesses%2Bat%2Btwo%2Bspatial%2Bscales%2Balong%2Ba%2Bfloodplain%2Briver%2B%2528Tagliamento%252C%2BItaly%2529%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DDoering%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1899%252F12-013.1%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D25%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D12-25%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D12%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DDoering%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DUehlinger%252C%2BU%26rft.au%3DTockner%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
35,"Jachens, ER",Apr 2021 ,"Effects of Groundwater-Surface Water Exchange Mechanism in the National Water Model over the Northern High Plains Aquifer, USA",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Surface water and groundwater are intimately connected by a two-way flux between the stream and underlying aquifers. The National Water Model (NWM) currently only considers a one-way flux, where groundwater can enter a stream but cannot return to the aquifer. The Northern High Plains Aquifer, USA is used as a case study to investigate the consequences of omitting two-way stream-aquifer fluxes on streamflow prediction capabilities of the NWM during hydrologic extremes. Instead of traditional field techniques to identify stream-aquifer fluxes, this study presents an integrated approach to classify likely stream regimes using three identification methods: United States Geological Survey (USGS) gage data, simulated stream-aquifer fluxes from an existing USGS Groundwater Availability Model, and the normalized difference vegetation index from remote sensing. For flood events, the modeled flood response for losing streams is characterized by statistically significant earlier peak discharges and an overestimate of the observed flood volume when compared to gaining streams. For drought events, our study found no statistical difference between losing and gaining streams, however, modeled streamflow from the NWM overestimated the observed USGS hydrograph. The systematic overestimate of streamflow by the NWM could be, in part, due to the lack of a losing stream mechanism which was on average 0.1% streamflow loss per streamwise km along the river.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000550413400001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2BGroundwater-Surface%2BWater%2BExchange%2BMechanism%2Bin%2Bthe%2BNational%2BWater%2BModel%2Bover%2Bthe%2BNorthern%2BHigh%2BPlains%2BAquifer%252C%2BUSA%26rft.aufirst%3DElizabeth%2BR.%26rft.auinit%3DER%26rft.aulast%3DJachens%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.12869%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D255%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D241-255%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D241%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DJachens%252C%2BER%26rft.au%3DHutcheson%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DSteward%252C%2BDR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
36,"Helton, AM",Jan 2018 ,How network structure can affect nitrogen removal by streams,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Streams and rivers can be highly reactive sites for nitrogen (N) transformation and removal. Empirical and model-based research show how location in a stream network affects rates of N removal. Because the structure of stream networks can vary widely and N cycling in headwater streams may affect N cycling in downstream reaches, we hypothesised that network structure may affect whole stream network processing of N.2. We generated three stream networks with the same catchment area but differing shapes, based on optimal channel network theory. We applied a model of nitrate (NO3-) transport and denitrification, and implemented model scenarios to examine how network shape affects NO3- removal with (1) increased NO3- loading from the catchment, (2) altered spatial distributions of NO3- loading and (3) decreased drainage density (i. e. loss of headwater streams).3. For all stream networks, the fraction of total NO3- removed decreased with increasing NO3- loading from the catchment. Stream networks in narrow catchments removed a higher fraction of NO3- 3, particularly at intermediate NO3- loading rates. Network shape also controlled the distribution of removal in small versus large streams, with larger streams removing a higher fraction of the total NO3- load in narrower networks.4. The effects of network shape on NO3- removal when the spatial distribution of NO3- loading was altered varied with the magnitude of NO3- loading. At low loads, NO3- was entirely removed when added to distal parts of the stream network, and about 50% removed when added near the outlet; there was no effect of network shape. At intermediate and high loads, the fraction of total NO3- load removed by the narrow stream network was 1.59 higher than the rectangular and square networks when NO3- was added to distal parts of the networks. Network shape did not have an effect when NO3- load occurred near the outlet, regardless of the magnitude of the NO3- load.5. The fraction of total NO3- removed by the stream network was up to 5% lower when drainage density was reduced from 1.0 to 0.74 km(-1), with the least change for the narrow network. Reducing the drainage density also altered the role of small relative to large streams, with the net effect of moving the location of NO3- removal downstream.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000423280700011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHow%2Bnetwork%2Bstructure%2Bcan%2Baffect%2Bnitrogen%2Bremoval%2Bby%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DAshley%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DHelton%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Ffwb.12990%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2427%26rft.epage%3D140%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D128-140%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D128%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D63%26rft.au%3DHelton%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DHall%252C%2BRO%26rft.au%3DBertuzzo%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

38,"Rai, PK",Jul 2018 ,Coupling of 1D models (SWAT and SWMM) with 2D model (iRIC) for mapping inundation in Brahmani and Baitarani river delta,NATURAL HAZARDS,"River flooding has been causing extensive losses to life and property, which is a serious concern worldwide. To minimize these losses, suitable planning and management practices are required for the floodplain mapping. Flash floods occur almost every year in the deltaic region of Brahmani and Baitarani river basins in India, during the monsoon season. Generally, 1D modelling is considered as a regular practice. But nowadays, model formulations include 1D for the representation of river channels and 2D for representing river floodplains. In the absence of uniform observations, a hybrid model (1D-2D coupled model) has been developed for this deltaic region to identify the extent of inundation and its depth during the flooding, since 1D models alone do not provide detailed information of flooding. Thus, a well-known 2D river hydrodynamic model iRIC was externally coupled with 1D (SWAT and SWMM) models to simulate and visualize flood scenarios and to identify the flood-prone areas. The hydrological model SWAT was calibrated and validated for Brahmani river deltaic basin, with the observed discharge data available. However for Baitarani river basin, observed flow data were missing and only gauge data were available at few monitoring stations. Hence, for Baitarani river basin, the SWMM model was developed and calibrated with the help of Monte Carlo method. Finally, the SWAT- and SWMM-based tributary stream flow outputs were fed together into the iRIC hydrodynamic model as input for flood inundation mapping. The discharge and water gauge data were used for the calibration and validation. The results obtained from the coupled model were found to be in good agreement with the observed data (RMSE value is 0.77 and 0.79 during calibration and validation, respectively), which enabled identification of the flood-prone areas. The developed model may be used as a tool for effective planning and management of natural disasters such as flash floods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000433913500027,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Bof%2B1D%2Bmodels%2B%2528SWAT%2Band%2BSWMM%2529%2Bwith%2B2D%2Bmodel%2B%2528iRIC%2529%2Bfor%2Bmapping%2Binundation%2Bin%2BBrahmani%2Band%2BBaitarani%2Briver%2Bdelta%26rft.aufirst%3DPawan%2BKumar%26rft.auinit%3DPK%26rft.aulast%3DRai%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11069-018-3281-4%26rft.eissn%3D1573-0840%26rft.epage%3D1840%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0921-030X%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DNATURAL%2BHAZARDS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1821-1840%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1821%26rft.stitle%3DNAT%2BHAZARDS%26rft.volume%3D92%26rft.au%3DRai%252C%2BPK%26rft.au%3DDhanya%252C%2BCT%26rft.au%3DChahar%252C%2BBR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=NATURAL+HAZARDS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT

Concentrations of Cl, Br and I in each river, obtained at 10 sampling points from the upper stream to the river mouth, tended to increase near the river mouth. The ranges of geometric means of Cl, Br and I in each river were 1.0-19.4 mgl(-1), 2.5-67.9 mu gl(-1), and 0.18-8.34 mu gl(-1), respectively. To compare halogen behavior, the concentration ratios, Br/Cl and I/Cl, were calculated. The Br/Cl range was (2.3-7.8) x 10(-3) (geometric mean: 3.74 x 10(-3)), and it was nearly constant except for the Yoneshiro river. It was estimated that 60-80% of total Br in the middle to lower parts of this river was the excess Br. The Br chemical form in all the rivers is generally considered to be Br-. The I/Cl ratios had different trends in rivers flowing into the Japan Sea and Pacific Ocean, possibly due to the different geological features in the river catchments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These dynamic processes shape the floodplain landscape, resulting in a shifting mosaic of habitats, both above and below ground. We present a new and innovative methodology to quantitatively assess the geomorphic work potential necessary to maintain a shifting habitat mosaic for gravel-bed river floodplains. This approach can be used to delineate critical habitats for preservation through land acquisition and conservation easements, often critical elements of river restoration plans worldwide. Spatially explicit modeling of water depth, flow velocity, shear stress, and stream power derived from surface hydraulic measurements was combined with airborne multispectral remote sensing for detailed modeling of floodplain water surfaces over tens to hundreds of square kilometers. The model results were then combined within a GIS framework to determine potential nodes of channel avulsion that delineate spatially explicit zones across the floodplain where the potential for geomorphic work is the greatest. Results of this study demonstrate the utility of integrating existing multispectral remote sensing data coupled with time-lagged ground-based measures of flow hydraulics to model fluvial processes at relatively fine spatial resolutions but over broad regional extents.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000230876900011,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2Bairborne%2Bmultispectral%2Bimagery%2Bto%2Bevaluate%2Bgeomorphic%2Bwork%2Bacross%2Bfloodplains%2Bof%2Bgravel-bed%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DMS%26rft.auinit%3DMS%26rft.aulast%3DLorang%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1890%252F03-5290%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5582%26rft.epage%3D1222%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1051-0761%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1209-1222%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1209%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DLorang%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DWhited%252C%2BDC%26rft.au%3DStanford%252C%2BJA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
41,"Barnes, RT",Nov 2019 ,Hydrogeologic Controls of Surface Water-Groundwater Nitrogen Dynamics Within a Tidal Freshwater Zone,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Microbial processing of reactive nitrogen in stream sediments and connected aquifers can remove and transform nitrogen prior to its discharge into coastal waters, decreasing the likelihood of harmful algal blooms and low oxygen levels in estuaries. Canonical wisdom points to the decreased capacity of rivers to retain nitrogen as they flow toward the coast. However, how tidal freshwater zones, which often extend hundreds of kilometers inland, process and remove nitrogen remains unknown. Using geochemical measurements and numerical models, we show that tidal pumping results in the rapid cycling of nitrogen within distinct zones throughout the riparian aquifer. Near the fluctuating water table nitrification dominates, with high nitrate concentrations (>10 mg N/L) and consistent isotopic composition. Beneath this zone, isotopes reveal that nitrate is both denitrified and added over the tidal cycle, maintaining nitrate concentrations >3-4 mg N/L. In most of the riparian aquifer and streambed, nitrate concentrations are <0.5 mg N/L, suggesting denitrification dominates. Model results reveal that oxygen delivery to groundwater from the overlying unsaturated soil fuels mineralization and nitrification, with subsequent denitrification in low-oxygen, high organic matter regions. Depending on flow paths, tidal freshwater zones could be sources of nitrate in regions with permeable sediment and low organic matter content.Plain Language Summary Human activities related to energy and food production add large amounts of reactive nitrogen to the landscape. Rain and snow wash some of that nitrogen into rivers and eventually to the coast. The addition of excess nitrogen to coastal ecosystems can cause excessive algal growth and low-oxygen conditions, which can lead to fish kills. As nitrogen travels to the coast, microbes in the sediment beneath and near the river process and remove large portions of this nitrogen. It is unclear how daily tidal fluctuations within the freshwater tidal zone alter these processes. Geochemical measurements of pore water beneath the stream and within the stream bank reveal that there are different zones of nitrogen processing, where differences in sediment type and water exchange control the supply of reactants. Zones of nitrate production exist within the stream bank aquifer, but conditions favoring nitrate removal dominate the aquifer. Therefore, depending on how water moves through the subsurface, it is possible that tidal fresh water zones could act as a source of nitrate to the stream channel, exacerbating coastal management challenges.Key PointsHydrologic fluctuations drive diel nitrogen dynamics within the tidal freshwater zone Organic matter content and hydrologic connectivity determine whether nitrate production or nitrate removal dominates within bank storage zones Tidal freshwater zones are a sink of groundwater borne nitrateShow less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000495173200001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHydrogeologic%2BControls%2Bof%2BSurface%2BWater-Groundwater%2BNitrogen%2BDynamics%2BWithin%2Ba%2BTidal%2BFreshwater%2BZone%26rft.aufirst%3DRebecca%2BT.%26rft.auinit%3DRT%26rft.aulast%3DBarnes%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2019JG005164%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D3355%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3343-3355%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3343%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D124%26rft.au%3DBarnes%252C%2BRT%26rft.au%3DSawyer%252C%2BAH%26rft.au%3DHastings%252C%2BMG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
42,"Molina-Moctezuma, A",Jan 2021 ,"Restoration of rapids habitat in a Great Lakes connecting channel, the St. Marys River, Michigan",RESTORATION ECOLOGY,"Aquatic habitat has been extensively altered throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes to increase navigation connectivity. In particular, the St. Marys River, a Great Lakes connecting channel, lost >50% of its historic rapids habitat over the past century. In 2016, the natural flow was restored to the Little Rapids area of the St. Marys River. The goal of our study was to evaluate physical and ecological responses to the restoration of the Little Rapids area. Extensive habitat and biological data were collected prior to restoration (2013 and 2014), and after restoration (2017 and 2018). Measured parameters included total suspended solids, current velocity, benthic macroinvertebrates, and larval, juvenile, and adult fishes. Total suspended solids stayed low (<4 mg/L) following restoration, with the exception of a single construction-related event. Pre-restoration data indicated that all measured velocities were below the target flow rate of 0.24 m/s, whereas 70% of the measured habitat was above the target flow post-restoration. Abundance and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates were reduced following restoration (>90% reduction). We observed a 45% increase in richness of larval fish 2 years after restoration and a 131% increase in catch per unit effort. For adult fishes, the proportion of individuals with a preference for fast-moving waters increased from 1.5 to 45% in the restored area, and from 7 to 15% upstream of the restored area; a similar response was observed for lithophilic spawners. The physical and biological conditions of the Little Rapids improved and resembled conditions typical of rapids habitat extent in other areas of the river and other systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000597308100001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be13310%26rft.atitle%3DRestoration%2Bof%2Brapids%2Bhabitat%2Bin%2Ba%2BGreat%2BLakes%2Bconnecting%2Bchannel%252C%2Bthe%2BSt.%2BMarys%2BRiver%252C%2BMichigan%26rft.aufirst%3DAlejandro%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMolina-Moctezuma%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Frec.13310%26rft.eissn%3D1526-100X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1061-2971%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DRESTORATION%2BECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DRESTOR%2BECOL%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DMolina-Moctezuma%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DEllis%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DMoerke%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=RESTORATION+ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
43,"Forsman, KJ",Jan 15 2002 ,The effects of partly irreversible solute exchange: comparison between conservative and sorptive transport in streams,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Contaminant transport in streams and rivers is often affected by the solute exchange between the main stream and various adjacent storage zones as well as chemical and biological processes. This paper focuses on the difference between the effects of conservative and reactive solute exchange, respectively, in terms of an analytical transport model that takes into account main stream advection, solute exchange with storage zones, instantaneous equilibrium sorption and first order reactions. The effects of longitudinal variation of water flow and hydraulic radius as well as transversal variation of streambed porosity were included in the analysis, which was conducted on a reach by reach basis. To be able to use a temporally variable upstream concentration as boundary concentration, the measured breakthroughs were divided into 30-150 segments of constant concentration and the solutions were obtained as the sum of solutions for all segments. An experiment in Uppland County in Sweden, constitutes the basis for this study. Results from a simultaneous injection of the tracers tritium, (H2O)-H-3, and chromium Cr-51(III), made it possible to distinguish between conservative and reactive transport along a 30 km. reach of the Sava Stream. The peak concentration of the reactive chromium decreased faster with distance, than that of tritium. The main hypothesis is that the chromium exchange is affected by both rapid sorption processes and slower reactions in the subsurface storage zones. In this framework, the slow processes appear as irreversible, which is true at least on the time scale represented by the data. The irreversibility is probably caused by the net effect of various slow chemical processes, e.g. solute precipitation/co-precipitation and irreversible sorption, which decreases the washout rate after the main bulk of the solute has passed by in the stream. A fully reversible exchange description, with instantaneous equilibrium partitioning, gives a clearly overestimated tail for chromium, which is not the case with the present concept. Results obtained by independently evaluating seven subreaches of the stream give mean Reaction Damkohler numbers for the storage zone equalling 2.63 for the transport of Cr-51 and 0 for (H2O)-H-3.

44,"Motaman, S",Dec 15 2013 ,Numerical and experimental modelling of back stream flow during close-coupled gas atomization,COMPUTERS & FLUIDS,"This paper reports the numerical and experimental investigation into the effects of different gas jet mismatch angles (for an external melt nozzle wall) on the back-stream flow in close coupled gas atomization. The Pulse Laser Imaging (PLI) technique was applied for visualising the back-stream melt flow phenomena with an analogue water atomizer and the associated PLI images compared with numerical results. In the investigation a Convergent-Divergent (C-D) discrete gas jet die at five different atomization gas pressures of 1-5 MPa, with different gas exit jet distances of 1.65, 1.6, 1.55, 1.5, 1.45 and 1.40 mm from the melt nozzle external wall, was combined with four melt nozzles of varying gas jet mis-match angles of 0 degrees, 3 degrees, 5 degrees, and 7 degrees relative to the melt nozzle external wall (referred to as nozzle types 1-4). The results show that nozzle type 1 with the smallest mis-match angle of zero degrees has highest back-stream flow at an atomization gas pressure of 1 MPa and a gas die exit jet located between 1.65 mm and 1.5 mm from the external melt nozzle wall. This phenomenon decreased with increasing mis-match angle and at higher atomization gas pressure. For nozzle type 2, with a mis-match angle of 3 degrees, a weak back-stream flow occurred with a gas exit jet distance of 1.65 mm from the melt nozzle external wall. For a gas pressure of 1 MPa with a decrease in the gas jet exit distance from the external wall of the melt nozzle this phenomenon was eliminated. This phenomenon was not seen for nozzle types 3 and 4 at any gas pressure and C-D gas exit jet distances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

45,"Zhang, ZY",Aug 14 2019 ,A Coupled Modeling Approach for Water Management in a River-Reservoir System,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"A coupled model is an effective tool to understand the nutrient fate associated with hydrodynamic and ecosystem processes and thereby developing a water resource management strategy. This paper presents a coupled modeling approach that consists of a watershed model and a hydrodynamic model to evaluate the nutrient fate in a river-reservoir system. The results obtained from the model showed a good agreement with field observations. The results revealed that the Shuikou reservoir (Fuzhou, China)exhibited complicated hydrodynamic characteristics, which may induce the pattern of nutrient export. Reservoirs can greatly lower water quality as a result of decreasing water movement. Three scenarios were analyzed for water management. The NH3-N (Ammonia Nitrogen) decreased sharply in the outlet of Shuikou reservoir after NH3-N level in its tributary was reduced. After removing the farming cages, the water quality of the outlet of Shuikou reservoir was improved significantly. The DO (Dissolved Oxygen) had increased by 3%-10%, NH3-N had reduced by 5%-17%, and TP (Total Phosphorus) had reduced by 6%-21%. This study demonstrates that the proposed coupled modeling approach can effectively characterize waterway risks for water management in such a river-reservoir system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000484419000113,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B2949%26rft.atitle%3DA%2BCoupled%2BModeling%2BApproach%2Bfor%2BWater%2BManagement%2Bin%2Ba%2BRiver-Reservoir%2BSystem%26rft.aufirst%3DZhenyu%26rft.auinit%3DZY%26rft.aulast%3DZhang%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph16162949%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1661-7827%26rft.issue%3D16%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D16%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BZY%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BJL%26rft.au%3DLu%252C%2BYM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
46,"Chatanantavet, P",Jun 2014 ,Sediment transport and topographic evolution of a coupled river and river plume system: An experimental and numerical study,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE,"Sediment transfer from rivers to the ocean is the fundamental driver of continental sedimentation with implications for carbon burial, land use dynamics, and unraveling global climate change and Earth history from sedimentary strata. Coastal rivers are dynamically coupled to their offshore plumes at the river mouth creating regions of nonuniform flow that can dictate patterns of erosion and deposition both onshore and offshore. However, there are limited experimental and modeling studies on sediment transport and morphodynamics of coupled river and river plume systems and their response to multiple flood events. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a quasi-2-D, morphodynamic numerical model and conducted exploratory flume experiments in a 7.5 m long flume where a 10 cm wide river channel was connected to a 76 cm wide ""ocean basin."" Both the numerical model and the flume results demonstrate that (1) during low-discharge flows, backwater hydrodynamics cause spatial-flow deceleration and deposition in the river channel and the offshore plume area, and (2) during high flows the water surface is drawn down to sea level, resulting in spatial-flow acceleration and bed scour. During high-discharge flows, we also found that the offshore river plume self-channelized owing to both levee formation and bed scour. Our study suggests that coastal rivers may be in a perpetual state of morphodynamic adjustment and highlights the need to link rivers and river plumes under a suite of flow discharges to accurately predict fluvio-deltaic morphodynamics and connectivity between fluvial sediment sources and marine sinks.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000340682000004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSediment%2Btransport%2Band%2Btopographic%2Bevolution%2Bof%2Ba%2Bcoupled%2Briver%2Band%2Briver%2Bplume%2Bsystem%253A%2BAn%2Bexperimental%2Band%2Bnumerical%2Bstudy%26rft.aufirst%3DPhairot%26rft.auinit%3DP%26rft.aulast%3DChatanantavet%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013JF002810%26rft.eissn%3D2169-9011%26rft.epage%3D1282%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-9003%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-EARTH%2BSURFACE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1263-1282%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1263%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-EARTH%26rft.volume%3D119%26rft.au%3DChatanantavet%252C%2BP%26rft.au%3DLamb%252C%2BMP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-EARTH+SURFACE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
47,"Xie, YQ",Sep 2015 ,On the limits of heat as a tracer to estimate reach-scale river-aquifer exchange flux,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"For the past few decades, heat has been used to estimate river-aquifer exchange flux at discrete locations by comparison of river and groundwater temperature. In recent years, heat has also been employed to estimate reach-scale river-aquifer exchange flux based only on river temperature. However, there are many more parameters that govern heat exchange and transport in surface water than in groundwater. In this study, we analyzed the sensitivities of surface water temperature to various parameters and assessed the accuracy of temperature-based estimates of exchange flux in two synthetic rivers and in a field setting. For the large synthetic river with a flow rate of 63 m(3) s(-1) (i.e., 5.44 x 10(6) m(3) d(-1)), the upper and lower bounds of the groundwater inflow rate can be determined when the actual groundwater inflow is around 100 m(2) d(-1). For higher and lower fluxes, only minimum and maximum bounds, respectively, can be determined. For the small synthetic river with the flow rate of 0.63 m(3) s(-1) (i.e., 5.44 x 10(4) m(3) d(-1)), the bounds of the groundwater inflow rate can only be estimated when the actual groundwater inflow rate is near 10 m(2) d(-1). In the field setting, results show that the inflow rate must be less than 100 m(2) d(-1), but a lower bound for groundwater inflow cannot be determined. The large ranges of estimated groundwater inflow rates in both theoretical and field settings indicate the need to reduce parameter errors and combine heat measurements with other isotopic and/or chemical methods.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000363391300027,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2Bthe%2Blimits%2Bof%2Bheat%2Bas%2Ba%2Btracer%2Bto%2Bestimate%2Breach-scale%2Briver-aquifer%2Bexchange%2Bflux%26rft.aufirst%3DYueqing%26rft.auinit%3DYQ%26rft.aulast%3DXie%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2014WR016741%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D7416%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D7401-7416%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D7401%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D51%26rft.au%3DXie%252C%2BYQ%26rft.au%3DCook%252C%2BPG%26rft.au%3DZheng%252C%2BCM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
48,"Nowinski, JD",Nov 23 2012 ,Hydraulic and thermal response of groundwater-surface water exchange to flooding in an experimental aquifer,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The effects of flooding on interactions between streams and shallow aquifers are poorly studied due to the unpredictable nature of flooding events. This study examines groundwater surface water interactions in a constructed experimental meander over several simulated flood events using hydrologic and thermal monitoring. Detailed steady-state hydraulic head measurements were taken of the stream surface and in 59 piezometer nests during baseflow, bankfull flow, and overbank flooding conditions, allowing for three-dimensional hydrologic characterization. Additionally, a lithium tracer test was conducted, and pressure transducers and thermistors were deployed to capture transient behavior. Results demonstrate extensive coupling between the stream and adjacent alluvial aquifer under all discharge conditions. Water table elevation responds rapidly to changes in stream stage and re-equilibrates to order of magnitude increases in discharge within about 1 h. Though flooding elevates the water table, steady-state hydraulic gradients within the meander are independent of stream stage. This results from the flow boundary condition imposed by the stream, which deepens in response to flooding but has a slope that is essentially independent of discharge. In addition to the stream boundary, flow within the meander is also controlled by loss of stream water to the subsurface, which directs hydraulic gradients towards the base of the meander. Finally, the temperature distribution within the meander during normal and bankfull flow mimics the water table distribution and results from advected warm stream water being progressively cooled by vertical conduction in the direction of groundwater flow. These findings suggest that areas of high reaction rates within meanders (hot spots) will be sensitive to whether a stream reach is gaining or losing water to the subsurface. Further, the location of these hot spots of is likely independent of stream stage, though other controls on reaction rates may be affected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

49,"Liu, Y",Oct 2017 ,Divergent Developmental Trajectories and Strategic Coupling in the Pearl River Delta: Where Is a Sustainable Way of Regional Economic Growth?,SUSTAINABILITY,"This paper interprets regional economic sustainability in the context of the globalization of late-coming regions. Drawing upon the concept of strategic coupling from economic geography, this paper proposes two types of strategic coupling, captive and proactive coupling, for better understanding regional sustainability and resilience through the experiences of the Pearl River Delta in China. It finds that sub-regional economies under captive coupling become highly dependent on exogenous growth and are vulnerable to external shocks. This trajectory looks less sustainable according to the general understanding, but it interestingly shows better resilience during and after the 2008 global financial crisis. In contrast, the ones under proactive coupling are less volatile, but growing much slower and are less resilient. By reporting these regional economic dynamics, this paper argues that sustainability in late-coming regions cannot be explained by either intra-regional forces or the means of global integration alone. In contrast, it has to be explained by the combination of both; the alleged strategic coupling in which economic growth and learning happens. This paper thus calls for greater attention to strategic coupling, the trade-off of globalization and resilience for understanding regional sustainability, rather than purely focusing on resource utilization and ecological balance.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000414896200112,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1782%26rft.atitle%3DDivergent%2BDevelopmental%2BTrajectories%2Band%2BStrategic%2BCoupling%2Bin%2Bthe%2BPearl%2BRiver%2BDelta%253A%2BWhere%2BIs%2Ba%2BSustainable%2BWay%2Bof%2BRegional%2BEconomic%2BGrowth%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DYi%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fsu9101782%26rft.eissn%3D2071-1050%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL%26rft.volume%3D9%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DLiang%252C%2BYT%26rft.au%3DHuang%252C%2BKX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0E6F0AOwgVwm9KDMIQcxgqv&SrcJTitle=SUSTAINABILITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT
