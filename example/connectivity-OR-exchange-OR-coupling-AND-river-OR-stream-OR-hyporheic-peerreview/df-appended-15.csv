0,0,"Jiang, QH",Jul 2022 ,N 2O dynamics in the hyporheic zone due to ripple migration,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The migration rate of ripples along the streambed has a profound effect on the hyporheic exchange and nitrogen dynamics. However, how the denitrification intermediate N2O is released in mobile bedforms still remain unclear. In this study, the ripple domains are established based on the sediment stability criteria by using the mean channel flow velocity U and the median sediment grain size D50. A two-dimensional numerical model coupling hyporheic flow, ripple migration and N2O transformation is proposed to investigate how ripple celerity affects N2O dynamics in streambeds. The results show that there are different patterns for the release of N2O from migrating ripples with different medium grain sizes D50 (0.06-0.3 mm). N2O can be released via upwelling of anoxic pore water from the deeper area in immobile or slow-mobile ripples. However, rapid ripple migration and the resulting fast vertical flow reversal can suppress the net pore water displacement and lead to the formation of a redox seal, which separates the deeper anoxic area from the above oxic area and inhibits N2O emissions. The magnitude of the nutrients concentration gradient and the N2O flux between these two areas depend only on the dispersive and diffusive transport. Therefore, the controls of N2O emission flux hence shift from the pumpingdominated regime in stable ripples to a grain size dominated regime of the migrating ripples. The possible implications about the effects of hydrodynamic changes due to the migration of ripples are presented. Our results emphasize that knowledge of N2O production-consumption hotspots within streambeds is essential to understand the mechanisms of N2O emissions from the sediment-water interface.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000803014200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B127891%26rft.atitle%3DN%2B2O%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bdue%2Bto%2Bripple%2Bmigration%26rft.aufirst%3DQihao%26rft.auinit%3DQH%26rft.aulast%3DJiang%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2022.127891%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D610%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BQH%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BDS%26rft.au%3DXu%252C%2BJZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127891,"N2O dynamics,Hyporheic exchange,Ripple migration,Nitrogen,Incomplete denitrification,Complete denitrification","NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS,PERMEABLE SEDIMENTS,NONSORBING SOLUTES,NITRATE REMOVAL,N2O EMISSIONS,HOT MOMENTS,OXYGEN,TRANSPORT,FLOW,GROUNDWATER",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing, Peoples R China"
1,1,"Sarriquet, PE",Oct 2007 ,Effects of bottom sediment restoration on interstitial habitat characteristics and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in a headwater stream,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"The restoration of in-stream habitats by structural improvement of stream beds is more and more frequent, but the ecological consequences of such works are still little known. We have examined the influence of the deposit of a 15 cm gravel layer over the stream bottom on the chemical characteristics of the interstitial water, the sediment grain size and the composition of the benthic assemblages. We have compared a restored reach to an upstream control over three years and at three seasons each year. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrite and nitrate contents were measured in both surface and interstitial (-15 cm deep) waters, together with the depth of anoxia estimated using wooden stakes and fine sediment content at the surface. During the same period and seasons, benthic invertebrates were sampled at five points in each reach. The restoration induced an increase in vertical exchanges of water between surface and interstitial habitats, with an increase in the depth of hypoxia. Changes were observed in the composition of invertebrate communities, but not in the density or in the taxonomic richness of assemblages. These changes in assemblages were fragile: a local disturbance (such as a drying period) diminished the beneficial effect of the restoration with the disappearance of several organisms. The viability of such restoration works may be associated with catchment management designed to reduce fine sediment inputs to the river.

2,2,"Hong, M",Sep 2020 ,"An Explicit Scheme to Represent the Bidirectional Hydrologic Exchanges Between the Vadose Zone, Phreatic Aquifer, and River",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Understanding groundwater storage variations as a result of effects from both the vadose zone and the river is of critical importance in the hydraulically connected surface-subsurface system. In this study, we present a novel Bidirectional Exchange Scheme in Surface and Subsurface (BE3S) that represents bidirectional exchanges between the vadose zone, phreatic aquifer, and river. The approach enables explicit representations of each flow regime while conserving mass, and successfully yields solutions of the coupled system for multiple temporal resolutions. We test the scheme by comparing the BE3S-derived outputs against other models and corresponding observational data. We apply the scheme to simulate hydrologic states in a reach of the Brazos River in Southeast Texas, such as soil moisture content, groundwater level, and river stage as well as net subsurface discharge fluxes. Good agreements between the simulated and observed data for all the components show the suitability of the proposed scheme in modeling the bidirectional flows and exchanges. We also assess how the bidirectional hydrologic exchanges are affected by adjacent flow domains. We find that vertical percolation is significantly affected by unsaturated soil thickness, resulting in the spatial variability of vertical percolation across sloping topography. Hilltop-to-valley convergent groundwater flow is also found to impede vertical percolation in river valleys due to shallow water table while facilitating percolation in the hilltops. The capability of the presented scheme that accounts for the topographically driven lateral groundwater flow and drainage dynamics provides the potential to enhance the representation of the surface-subsurface system in Earth System Models (ESMs).Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000578452200049,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR027571%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2BExplicit%2BScheme%2Bto%2BRepresent%2Bthe%2BBidirectional%2BHydrologic%2BExchanges%2BBetween%2Bthe%2BVadose%2BZone%252C%2BPhreatic%2BAquifer%252C%2Band%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DM.%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DHong%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR027571%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DHong%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DMohanty%252C%2BBP%26rft.au%3DSheng%252C%2BZ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR027571,"hydrologic exchange,vadose zone,river,phreatic aquifer,BE3S numerical scheme,boundary condition","LAND-SURFACE,BOUSSINESQ EQUATION,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,BANK STORAGE,SUBSURFACE FLOW,COUPLED SURFACE,STREAM,CLIMATE,MODEL,TRANSPORT",,"Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77834 USA"
3,3,"Lecce, SA",Sep 1997 ,Nonlinear downstream changes in stream power on Wisconsin's Blue River,ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS,"Spatial characteristics of stream power are examined along four stream reaches through the 208-km(2) Blue River watershed in southwestern Wisconsin. Although prevailing theoretical arguments often use spatially aggregated data and power functions derived from hydraulic geometry to suggest that stream power increases linearly downstream, analysis of stream-power trends along the Blue River's spatially connected stream pathways in southern Wisconsin shows that these pathways exhibit varying degrees of nonlinearity in the downstream distribution of stream power. In three of the four stream pathways, cross-sectional stream power and mean stream power reach maximum values at drainage areas between 10 and 100 km(2) before decreasing rapidly downstream. Geomorphic and lithologic controls, which produce unusually steep channel slopes in mid-basin locations, are primarily responsible for the nonlinear downstream trends in stream power. Wide valley bottoms and gentle channel gradients occur in erodible lithologies, while resistant lithologies are associated with narrow valley bottoms and steep channel gradients. Spatial variations in drainage network evolution and past stream flow and sediment conditions also influence modem channel gradients. Downstream variations in cross-sectional stream power along interconnected pathways within the drainage network influence the quantity of post-settlement overbank sediments stored on floodplains. Greater sediment storage occurs in the headwaters and lower valleys where stream power is low, whereas little sediment is stored in mid-basin reaches with high stream power.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1997XR26200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DNonlinear%2Bdownstream%2Bchanges%2Bin%2Bstream%2Bpower%2Bon%2BWisconsin%2527s%2BBlue%2BRiver%26rft.aufirst%3DSA%26rft.auinit%3DSA%26rft.aulast%3DLecce%26rft.date%3D1997%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1467-8306.00064%26rft.epage%3D486%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0004-5608%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DANNALS%2BOF%2BTHE%2BASSOCIATION%2BOF%2BAMERICAN%2BGEOGRAPHERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D471-486%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D471%26rft.stitle%3DANN%2BASSOC%2BAM%2BGEOGR%26rft.volume%3D87&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=ANNALS+OF+THE+ASSOCIATION+OF+AMERICAN+GEOGRAPHERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/1467-8306.00064,"stream power,channel slope,lithology,Wisconsin","HYDRAULIC GEOMETRY,NORTH-CAROLINA,SEDIMENT,CHANNELS,VARIABILITY,MIGRATION,DELIVERY,EROSION,STORAGE,PROFILE",,"UNIV SO MISSISSIPPI,DEPT GEOG & AREA DEV,HATTIESBURG,MS 39406, USA"
4,4,"Ock, G",Oct 2015 ,"Ecological functions of restored gravel bars, the Trinity River, California",ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Gravel augmentation has been increasingly used in sediment-limited systems in regulated channels as a means of creating morphological changes that beneficially affect the functioning of downstream ecosystems. Despite this trend, there have been few empirical studies to quantify these effects in relation to the morphology of gravel bars, especially in terms of riverine material exchanges such as heat and organic matter. We conducted field-based hydro-geomorphological observation of different mechanisms of gravel bar restoration in the downstream of Trinity Dam, California: a medial and a point bar deposited fluvially during high-flow gravel injection, an additional point bar created by direct placement of gravel, and an island created by side channel excavation. We measured water temperature, suspended particulate organic matter (S-POM) concentration, hydraulic gradients and shallow water width under base flow conditions along the perimeter of the gravel features. We then assessed water temperature modulation derived from hyporheic exchanges and S-POM retention of the gravel features, comparing the functions of the dynamically-constructed medial and point bars to those of the mechanically-constructed island and point bar. Diurnal water temperature fluctuations showed a notable thermal heterogeneity including cooling (1.5-3.1 degrees C) during summer peak temperatures, buffering in amplitude (1.2-4.0 degrees C) and lagging in phase (0.3-14.5 h), especially in the bar-tails and alcoves of the gravel bars. All of the gravel features reduced S-POM concentration at baseflow, showing the highest retention efficiency in the medial bar. In addition, the fluvially formed the medial and point bars had higher hydraulic gradients and wider shallow waters than the constructed features. Our results indicate that gravel bar restoration can increase hyporheic exchange and S-POM retention by increasing hydraulic gradients at baseflow, refreshing bed materials to enhance substrate permeability, and elongating the wetted boundary length in shallow waters. Our study results suggest that mechanically created in-channel geomorphic features combined with coarse sediment augmentation can increase channel complexity, driving hyporheic flows and increasing S-POM retention, thus ultimately resulting in thermal heterogeneity and food availability along gravel bed channels.

5,5,"Boano, F",Oct 24 2007 ,A continuous time random walk approach to the stream transport of solutes,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"The transport of solutes in rivers is influenced by the exchange of water between the river and the underlying hyporheic zone. The residence times of solutes in the hyporheic zone are typically much longer than traveltimes in the stream, resulting in a significant delay in the downstream propagation of solutes. A new model for this process is proposed here on the basis of the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW is a generalization of the classic random walk that can include arbitrary distributions of waiting times, and it is particularly suited to deal with the long residence times arising from hyporheic exchange. Inclusion of suitable hyporheic residence time distributions in the CTRW leads to a generalized advection-dispersion equation for instream concentration breakthrough curves that includes the effects of specific hyporheic exchange processes. Here examples are presented for advective hyporheic exchange resulting from regular and irregular series of bedforms. A second major advantage of the CTRW approach is that the combined effects of different processes affecting overall downstream transport can be incorporated in the model by convolving separate waiting time distributions for each relevant process. The utility of this approach is illustrated by analyzing the effects of local-scale sediment heterogeneity on bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. The ability to handle arbitrarily wide residence time distributions and the ability to assess the combined effects of multiple transport processes makes the CTRW model framework very useful for the study of solute transport problems in rivers. The model presented here can be easily extended to represent different types of surface-subsurface exchange processes and the transport of both conservative and nonconservative substances in rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000250525400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW10425%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bcontinuous%2Btime%2Brandom%2Bwalk%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bstream%2Btransport%2Bof%2Bsolutes%26rft.aufirst%3DF.%26rft.auinit%3DF%26rft.aulast%3DBoano%26rft.date%3D2007%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2007WR006062%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D43%26rft.au%3DBoano%252C%2BF%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DRidolfi%252C%2BL&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2007WR006062,,"TRANSIENT STORAGE MODEL,INDUCED HYPORHEIC-EXCHANGE,BED FORMS,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION,SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,MOUNTAIN STREAM,RIVERS,ZONE",,"Politecn Torino, Dept Hydraul Transports & Civil Infrastruct, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy"
6,6,"Datry, T",Sep 2015 ,Estimation of Sediment Hydraulic Conductivity in River Reaches and its Potential Use to Evaluate Streambed Clogging,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Streambed substrates have pervasive effects on stream biodiversity and biogeochemistry. The excessive input of fine sediments in streams and the subsequent alteration of the physical characteristics of streambed substrates are considered today as a major environmental issue. The estimation of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) may be simpler than other estimations of reach-scale physical characteristics and could serve to quantify the alterations of streambeds across stream networks. In this study, we examined between-reach and within-reach variability and temporal changes of streambed K across 101 stream reaches in France, including nine reaches previously judged as clogged and nine as references (unclogged). We also examined the relationships between K and some environmental variables such as vertical hydraulic gradient, streambed grain size, flow velocity or distance to the bank. We demonstrated that 15 measurements of streambed K per reach could be used to compare streams among each other and over time. Clogged reaches displayed much lower K than reference reaches, and more generally, reach-averaged K and the number of non-null K values per reach allowed discriminating reaches among each other without observer bias. K was higher in upwelling compared with downwelling areas, probably because of fine sediment uplifting. With the low cost in terms of equipment (stream monitoring networks such as clogging, but also for understanding large-scale drivers of these alterations, or for upscaling recent developments in hyporheic ecology at the reach scale.

7,7,"Sobczak, WV",Mar 2003 ,Relationships between DOC bioavailability and nitrate removal in an upland stream: An experimental approach,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"The Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York State have among the highest rates of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the United States. Some streams draining Catskill catchments have shown dramatic increases in nitrate concentrations while others have maintained low nitrate concentrations. Streams in which exchange occurs between surface and subsurface (i.e. hyporheic) waters are thought to be conducive to nitrate removal via microbial assimilation and/or denitrification. Hyporheic exchange was documented in the Neversink River in the southern Catskill Mountains, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) losses along hyporheic flowpaths were negligible. In this study, Neversink River water was amended with natural, bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) (leaf leachate) in a series of experimental mesocosms that simulated hyporheic flowpaths. DOC and N dynamics were examined before and throughout a three week BDOC amendment. In addition, bacterial production, dissolved oxygen demand, denitrification, and six extracellular enzyme activities were measured to arrive at a mechanistic understanding of potential DOC and NO3- removal along hyporheic flowpaths. There were marked declines in DOC and complete removal of nitrate in the BDOC amended mesocosms. Independent approaches were used to partition NO3- loss into two fractions: denitrification and assimilation. Microbial assimilation appears to be the predominant process explaining N loss. These results suggest that variability in BDOC may contribute to temporal differences in NO3- export from streams in the Catskill Mountains.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000179363600005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DRelationships%2Bbetween%2BDOC%2Bbioavailability%2Band%2Bnitrate%2Bremoval%2Bin%2Ban%2Bupland%2Bstream%253A%2BAn%2Bexperimental%2Bapproach%26rft.aufirst%3DWV%26rft.auinit%3DWV%26rft.aulast%3DSobczak%26rft.date%3D2003%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1023%252FA%253A1021192631423%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D327%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D309-327%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D309%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D62%26rft.au%3DSobczak%252C%2BWV%26rft.au%3DFindlay%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DDye%252C%2BS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1023/A:1021192631423,"bacteria,Catskill Mountains,denitrification,dissolved organic carbon,nitrate,stream sediments","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,CATSKILL MOUNTAINS,ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION,BACTERIAL PRODUCTION,NITROGEN SATURATION,RETENTION,DENITRIFICATION,WATERSHEDS,DYNAMICS,FORESTS",,"Coll Holy Cross, Dept Biol, Worcester, MA 01610 USA"
8,8,"TREMOLIERES, M",Jan 14 1994 ,THE EXCHANGE PROCESS BETWEEN RIVER AND GROUNDWATER ON THE CENTRAL ALSACE FLOODPLAIN (EASTERN FRANCE) .2. THE CASE OF A RIVER WITH FUNCTIONAL FLOODPLAIN,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"The floodplain of the river Ill in the Alsace Rhine valley is used as a model to study river-groundwater exchange process. Groundwater-fed streams located in the Ill floodplain are analysed using three methods: an analytical method based on hydrochemical variables (Cl-, NO3-, PO43- and NH4+), a phytosociological one based on surveys of aquatic macrophyte communities and a biological method based on the accumulation of mercury in the moss Fontinalis antipyretica. The results show that the eutrophicated and polluted river Ill (660 mug l-1 N-NH4+, 500 mug l-1 P-PO43-, 0.3-0.4 mg Hg kg-1 dry weight of moss) has a negative effect on the groundwater via the bed, depending on the level of the river bed in relation to the groundwater table level. Upstream of Colmar in the south of the Alsace floodplain, the Ill waters infiltrate and contaminate the groundwater, but this is not the case further downstream. Along a stretch of the Ill (40 km) annual floods provide eutrophicated and polluted waters to the aquifer. However these waters are purified during their transfer through the soil-vegetation system. Thus in the groundwater-fed streams the water is characterised by a low level of phosphate, ammonium nitrogen and mercury(10-20 mug l-1 N-NH4+ and P-PO43-, < 0.05 mg Hg kg-1 dry weight of moss). We demonstrate the importance of a functional floodplain in replenishing the aquifer with poor-nutrient waters. The aquatic vegetation of groundwater-fed streams reflects the water quality and thus can be used as a bioindicator and descriptor of river-groundwater exchange process.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1994MX43000003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTHE%2BEXCHANGE%2BPROCESS%2BBETWEEN%2BRIVER%2BAND%2BGROUNDWATER%2BON%2BTHE%2BCENTRAL%2BALSACE%2BFLOODPLAIN%2B%2528EASTERN%2BFRANCE%2529%2B.2.%2BTHE%2BCASE%2BOF%2BA%2BRIVER%2BWITH%2BFUNCTIONAL%2BFLOODPLAIN%26rft.aufirst%3DM%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DTREMOLIERES%26rft.date%3D1994%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252FBF00126766%26rft.epage%3D36%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0018-8158%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D19-36%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D19%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROBIOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D273%26rft.au%3DTREMOLIERES%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DROECK%252C%2BU%26rft.au%3DCARBIENER%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=HYDROBIOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/BF00126766,"RIVER-GROUNDWATER EXCHANGE,FLOODPLAIN,AQUATIC MACROPHYTE COMMUNITY,PHOSPHATE,MERCURY,RIVER ILL","PHOSPHORUS,EUTROPHICATION,BIOINDICATORS,COMMUNITIES,VEGETATION,AQUIFER,QUALITY,WATERS,CYCLES,PLAIN",,"FAC PHARM,PIREN EAU ALSACE RES GRP,CNRS,URA 95,CEREG,BOT & CRYPTOGAMIE LAB,74 ROUTE RHIN,BP 24,F-67400 ILLKIRCH GRAFFENS,FRANCE"
9,9,"Xian, Y",Oct 2021 ,On River-Aquifer Exchange Flow With Irregular and Semipervious Bank,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"River water flowing into and out of riparian aquifers driven by stage fluctuations during floods is critical for streamflow and biogeochemical cycling of hyporheic zones. Previous studies paid limited attention to the complex exchange flow between rivers and the adjacent unconfined aquifers through irregular and semipervious banks which are commonly seen in nature. This study proposed a new semi-analytical solution for describing the river-aquifer exchange flow by incorporating river stage hydrograph, and semipervious banks with irregular geometries. The solution was verified by comparing with the numerical solutions of the one-dimensional Boussinesq equation and two-dimensional variably saturated flow models. The comparisons indicated that the semi-analytical solution was robust to closely approximate the bank storage exchange flow through an irregular and semipervious bank. Moreover, an innovative dimensionless river bank index (BI) was proposed to quantitively identify the importance of riverbank geometry irregularity. BI = 0.4 and BI = 0.76 are the critical threshold values to determine whether realistic bank geometry should be incorporated or not. Specifically, when BI is less than 0.4, the conventionally vertical bank can be applied to substitute realistic irregular riverbanks; When BI is greater than 0.76, however, realistic bank geometries should be included and otherwise significant errors may occur, especially when BI is much greater than 0.76. The semi-analytical solution and BI have been successfully applied to the Hanford Reach of Columbia River, Washington, USA. The proposed solution and BI are useful for conceptual and diagnostic analysis of bank storage exchange flow and for understanding which factors and responses are important.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000711970600046,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR028984%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2BRiver-Aquifer%2BExchange%2BFlow%2BWith%2BIrregular%2Band%2BSemipervious%2BBank%26rft.aufirst%3DYang%26rft.auinit%3DY%26rft.aulast%3DXian%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR028984%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DXian%252C%2BY%26rft.au%3DJin%252C%2BMG%26rft.au%3DLiang%252C%2BX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR028984,"river-aquifer interaction,bank storage,irregular bank geometry,analytical model","WATER-TABLE FLUCTUATIONS,STREAM-STAGE,RECHARGE VARIATIONS,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,DIFFUSIVITY,RESISTANCE,STORAGE,IMPACT,EQUATION,ZONE",,"China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan, Peoples R China"
10,10,"Konrad, CP",Oct 15 2006 ,Location and timing of river-aquifer exchanges in six tributaries to the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The flow of water between rivers and contiguous aquifers influences the quantity and quality of water resources, particularly in regions where precipitation and runoff are unevenly distributed through the year, such as the Columbia Basin (CB) in northwestern United States. Investigations of basin hydrogeology and gains and losses of streamflow for six rivers in the CB were reviewed to characterize general patterns in the timing and location of river-aquifer exchanges at a reach-scale (0.5-150 km) and to identify geologic and geomorphic features associated with the largest exchanges. Ground-water discharge to each river, or the gain in streamflow, was concentrated spatially: more than one-half of the total gains along each river segment were contributed from reaches that represented no more than 30% of the total segment length with the largest and most concentrated gains in rivers in volcanic terrains. Fluvial recharge of aquifers, or losses of streamflow, was largest in rivers in sedimentary basins where unconsolidated sediments form shallow aquifers. Three types of geologic or geomorphic features were associated with the largest exchanges: (1) changes in the thickness of unconsolidated aquifers; (2) contacts between lithologic units that represent contrasts in permeability; and (3) channel forms that increase the hydraulic gradient or cross-sectional area of flow paths between a river and shallow ground-water. The down-valley component of ground-water flow and its vertical convergence on or divergence from a riverbed account for large streamflow gains in some reaches and contrast with the common assumption of lateral ground-water discharge to a river that penetrates completely through the aquifer. Increased ground-water discharge was observed during high-flow periods in reaches of four rivers indicating that changes in ground-water levels can be more important than stage fluctuations in regulating the direction and magnitude of river-aquifer exchanges and that assumptions about ground-water discharge during high flow periods used for base-flow separation must be verified. Given the variety of geologic terrains in the CB, the spatial and temporal patterns of river-aquifer exchanges provide a framework for investigations in other regions that includes a focus on reaches where the largest exchanges are likely to occur, integration of ground-water and surface-water data, and verification of assumptions regarding ground-water flow direction and temporal variation of exchanges.

This study assesses the pore water concentrations and diffusive fluxes of heavy metals with respect to the vertical water exchange flux (VWEF) and sediment grain size. Water and sediment samples were collected on August 2016 from upstream Site 1 and downstream Site 2 along the Juehe River in Shaanxi Province, China. Streambed vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) and the VWEF were estimated via the standpipe permeameter test method and Darcy's law. The heavy metal concentrations in the pore water were measured and the diffusive fluxes were calculated using Fick's first law. The VWEF patterns were dominated by upward flow, and Site 1 featured higher values of Kv and VWEF. Higher Cu and Zn concentrations occurred near the channel centre with coarse sand and gravel and greater upward VWEFs because coarser sediment and greater upward VWEFs cause stronger metal desorption capacity. Additionally, Cu and Zn at the two sites generally diffused from pore water to surface water, potentially due to the upward VWEF. The VWEF and sediment grain size are likely crucial factors influencing the heavy metal concentrations and diffusive fluxes.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000411574400072,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1020%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2BHyporheic%2BWater%2BFluxes%2Band%2BSediment%2BGrain%2BSize%2Bon%2Bthe%2BConcentration%2Band%2BDiffusive%2BFlux%2Bof%2BHeavy%2BMetals%2Bin%2Bthe%2BStreambed%26rft.aufirst%3DQi%26rft.auinit%3DQ%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fijerph14091020%26rft.eissn%3D1660-4601%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DINTERNATIONAL%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BPUBLIC%2BHEALTH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DINT%2BJ%2BENV%2BRES%2BPUB%2BHE%26rft.volume%3D14%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BQ%26rft.au%3DSong%252C%2BJX%26rft.au%3DHuo%252C%2BAD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=INTERNATIONAL+JOURNAL+OF+ENVIRONMENTAL+RESEARCH+AND+PUBLIC+HEALTH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/ijerph14091020,"heavy metals,hyporheic vertical water exchange fluxes,sediment grain size,spatial variability,diffusive fluxes,Juehe River","SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,SURFACE-WATER,SPATIAL VARIABILITY,RIVER,GROUNDWATER,EXCHANGE,CHINA,INTERFACE,USA,TEMPERATURE",,"Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Shaanxi Key Lab Earth Surface Syst & Environm Car, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China"

However, hyporheic zone pollution is widespread all over the world and remediations of hyporheic zones, when polluted by both heavy metals and organics, are challenging. Thus, the mechanisms and application of Calcium peroxide (CaO2) coupled with Zero-valent iron (ZVI) to simultaneously remove cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and acetochlor were investigated in this work. The effects of mass ratio of ZVI and CaO2, initial pH, and water matrices were evaluated. At initial pH 3, with the dosage of 1.5 g.L-1 ZVI and 0.5 g.L-1 CaO2, the removal efficiencies of Cd, Pb, and acetochlor were 96.7%, 99.8%, and 100%, respectively. Acetochlor was degraded into four main byproducts, and the toxicity evaluation indicated that the ecotoxicity of acetochlor was reduced during the degradation by CaO2/ZVI. In column transport experiments, with the mass ratios of ZVI and CaO2 to quartz sand of only 0.13% and 0.05%, the mass recovery efficiencies of Cd, Pb, and acetochlor from the effluent were 42.5%, 10.4%, and 0%, respectively. Cd was removed mainly by the adsorption of ZVI and iron(hydr)oxides (represented Fe3O4 and lepidocrocite); removal of Pb chiefly resulted from ZVI reduction, and hydroxyl radicals derived from the Fenton reaction accounted for acetochlor degradation. This work provides new insights and a facile strategy for in-situ remediations of hyporheic zones polluted simultaneously by heavy metals and organics.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000729148000008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B130900%26rft.atitle%3DEnhanced%2Bsimultaneous%2Bremoval%2Bof%2Bcadmium%252C%2Blead%252C%2Band%2Bacetochlor%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzones%2Bwith%2Bcalcium%2Bperoxide%2Bcoupled%2Bwith%2Bzero-valent%2Biron%253A%2BMechanisms%2Band%2Bapplication%26rft.aufirst%3DCheng%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DHou%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.cej.2021.130900%26rft.eissn%3D1873-3212%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1385-8947%26rft.jtitle%3DCHEMICAL%2BENGINEERING%2BJOURNAL%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DCHEM%2BENG%2BJ%26rft.volume%3D427%26rft.au%3DHou%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BXF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=CHEMICAL+ENGINEERING+JOURNAL&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.cej.2021.130900,"CaO2/ZVI,Simultaneous removal,Cadmium,Lead,Acetochlor,Hyporheic zone","WASTE-WATER TREATMENT,HEAVY-METALS,SELENITE REMOVAL,RISK-ASSESSMENT,DEGRADATION,RIVER,IDENTIFICATION,SEQUESTRATION,ANTIBIOTICS,GROUNDWATER",,"Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resources Reuse, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China"
13,13,"Larsen, S",Aug 2019 ,Testing the River Continuum Concept with geostatistical stream-network models,ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY,"The River Continuum Concept (RCC) provided one of the first unifying frameworks in fluvial ecosystem theory. While the RCC predictions held in many empirical tests, other research highlighted how the model overlooked sources of heterogeneity at different scales e.g. the effects of tributaries. Disentangling these effects requires an assessment of variation in key ecosystem variables over the longitudinal and lateral dimension of river networks. However, so far, no empirical tests have employed a spatially explicit statistical approach to this assessment.Here, we show how recently-developed spatially-explicit models for river networks can be used to test predictions of the RCC whilst taking into account cross-scale sources of heterogeneity. We used macroinvertebrate data from 195 monitoring sites from 1st to 4th order streams spread across the Adige River network (NE Italy). We compared theoretical expectations with empirical semivariograms that incorporated network topology to assess the continuity and patchiness in the proportion of invertebrates functional feeding groups (FFG) over Euclidean and in-stream distances. Geostatistical stream-network models were then used to quantify the influence of the longitudinal gradient relative to local-scale water quality and land-use drivers, while accounting for network spatial autocorrelation.Patterns in the semivariograms based on flow-connected relationships were characterised by a nested structure associated with heterogeneity at multiple scales. Therefore, the longitudinal variation in FFG was better described by a patchy discontinuum rather than a gradient, implying that both in-stream processes and landscape factors influenced stream ecosystem function. The overall shift in FFG along the longitudinal profile was generally consistent with the RCC predictions, although the best models often included water quality and local land-use predictors. Stream-network models further indicated that up to 90% of residual variation (mean = 50%) was accounted for by spatial autocorrelation, especially among flow-connected communities. Accounting for such autocorrelation not only improved model performance relative to non-spatial approaches, but indicated that most flow-connected communities were spatially correlated to some extent. This has clear implications for the assessment of the RCC tenets. This is the first test of the river continuum model that explicitly accounted for stream network topology and autocorrelation. Results indicated that in the Adige River, macroinvertebrates feeding groups exhibited heterogeneity along the longitudinal gradient, which appeared punctuated by local habitat transitions. Such transitions could be associated with artificial impoundments that alter the natural continuity of river processes, and we advocate the use of spatially explicit network models to test the RCC in more natural contexts.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000488317800007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B100773%26rft.atitle%3DTesting%2Bthe%2BRiver%2BContinuum%2BConcept%2Bwith%2Bgeostatistical%2Bstream-network%2Bmodels%26rft.aufirst%3DStefano%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DLarsen%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecocom.2019.100773%26rft.eissn%3D1476-9840%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1476-945X%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BCOMPLEXITY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BCOMPLEX%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DLarsen%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DBruno%252C%2BMC%26rft.au%3DZolezzi%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+COMPLEXITY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ecocom.2019.100773,"Functional feeding groups,Macroinvertebrates,Longitudinal gradient,Semivariograms,Autocorrelation,Adige River","SPATIAL STATISTICAL-MODELS,FUNCTIONAL FEEDING GROUPS,MOVING-AVERAGE APPROACH,MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,ECOLOGY,AUTOCORRELATION,PATTERNS,INVERTEBRATES,ORGANIZATION,SPACE",,"Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Trento, Italy"
14,14,"Flipo, N",2014 ,Continental hydrosystem modelling: the concept of nested stream-aquifer interfaces,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Coupled hydrological-hydrogeological models, emphasising the importance of the stream-aquifer interface, are more and more used in hydrological sciences for pluri-disciplinary studies aiming at investigating environmental issues. Based on an extensive literature review, stream-aquifer interfaces are described at five different scales: local [10 cm-similar to 10 m], intermediate [similar to 10 m-similar to 1 km], watershed [10 km(2)-similar to 1000 km(2)], regional [10 000 km(2)-similar to 1 M km(2)] and continental scales [> 10 M km(2)]. This led us to develop the concept of nested stream-aquifer interfaces, which extends the well-known vision of nested groundwater pathways towards the surface, where the mixing of low frequency processes and high frequency processes coupled with the complexity of geomorphological features and heterogeneities creates hydrological spiralling. This conceptual framework allows the identification of a hierarchical order of the multi-scale control factors of stream-aquifer hydrological exchanges, from the larger scale to the finer scale. The hyporheic corridor, which couples the river to its 3-D hyporheic zone, is then identified as the key component for scaling hydrological processes occurring at the interface. The identification of the hyporheic corridor as the support of the hydrological processes scaling is an important step for the development of regional studies, which is one of the main concerns for water practitioners and resources managers.In a second part, the modelling of the stream-aquifer interface at various scales is investigated with the help of the conductance model. Although the usage of the temperature as a tracer of the flow is a robust method for the assessment of stream-aquifer exchanges at the local scale, there is a crucial need to develop innovative methodologies for assessing stream-aquifer exchanges at the regional scale. After formulating the conductance model at the regional and intermediate scales, we address this challenging issue with the development of an iterative modelling methodology, which ensures the consistency of stream-aquifer exchanges between the intermediate and regional scales.Finally, practical recommendations are provided for the study of the interface using the innovative methodology MIM (Measurements-Interpolation-Modelling), which is graphically developed, scaling in space the three pools of methods needed to fully understand stream-aquifer interfaces at various scales. In the MIM space, stream-aquifer interfaces that can be studied by a given approach are localised. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated with two examples. The first one proposes an upscaling framework, structured around river reaches of similar to 10-100 m, from the local to the watershed scale. The second example highlights the usefulness of space borne data to improve the assessment of stream-aquifer exchanges at the regional and continental scales. We conclude that further developments in modelling and field measurements have to be undertaken at the regional scale to enable a proper modelling of stream-aquifer exchanges from the local to the continental scale.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000341597600020,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DContinental%2Bhydrosystem%2Bmodelling%253A%2Bthe%2Bconcept%2Bof%2Bnested%2Bstream-aquifer%2Binterfaces%26rft.aufirst%3DN.%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DFlipo%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fhess-18-3121-2014%26rft.eissn%3D1607-7938%26rft.epage%3D3149%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1027-5606%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGY%2BAND%2BEARTH%2BSYSTEM%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3121-3149%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3121%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BEARTH%2BSYST%2BSC%26rft.volume%3D18%26rft.au%3DFlipo%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DMouhri%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DWeill%252C%2BP&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGY+AND+EARTH+SYSTEM+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/hess-18-3121-2014,,"SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,1ST-ORDER EXCHANGE COEFFICIENT,HYDROLOGIC-RESPONSE SIMULATION,REDUCING MONITORING GAPS,CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,GROUNDWATER-FLOW,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY,LAND-SURFACE",,"PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, Dept Geosci, Paris, France"
15,15,"Boulton, AJ",Sep 1998 ,"Effects of buried leaf litter and vertical hydrologic exchange on hyporheic water chemistry and fauna in a gravel-bed river in northern New South Wales, Australia",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. Large amounts of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) are buried in the sand and gravel beds of many rivers during spates. The effects of these patchily distributed resources on hyporheic invertebrates and water chemistry are poorly understood. Buried CPOM may provide local 'hot-spots' of food for hyporheic detritivores and their predators, alter nutrient supply to nearby sediment biofilms, and generate habitat for some invertebrates.2. To examine potential short-term effects on hyporheic water chemistry, nutrient concentrations and invertebrate assemblage composition, leaf packs were buried in downwelling (surface water infiltrating the hyporheic zone) and upwelling (hyporheic water emerging to the surface) zones at two sites along a gravel-bed river in northern New South Wales. At one site, pits were excavated to simulate leaf burial (procedural control) and plastic 'leaves' were buried to test whether invertebrates might respond to leaves as refuges rather than food. Hyporheic CPOM, sediment size fractions, and interstitial silt content were also quantified at these sites.3. Dry weights of naturally buried CPOM (leaf litter and wood fragments) varied substantially (0.6-71.7 g L-1 sediment). Amounts of CPOM did not differ between up- vs. downwelling zones or between sites. Hyporheic dissolved oxygen saturation was generally high (> 75%), and was lower in upwelling zones. The hyporheos was dominated taxonomically by water mites (approximate to 20 species), whereas small oligochaetes were most abundant (40% of total abundance). Tiny instars of elmid beetle larvae and leptophlebiid mayfly nymphs were also common. Before experimental manipulation, faunal composition differed between up- and downwelling zones. In upwelling zones, bathynellaceans and blind peracarids were found, whereas small individuals of the surface benthos were common in samples from downwelling zones. This validated stratification of the experiment across zones of hydrologic exchange.4. Twenty days after leaf burial, there was no effect of the treatments at either site on changes in most variables, including mean numbers of taxa and individuals per sample. Similarly, changes in faunal composition of the hyporheos in the treatments paralleled those in the controls except for a weak response in the buried leaves treatment in the upwelling zone at site 1. Artificially buried leaf litter does not seem to influence hyporheic water chemistry or fauna at these two sites. It is probable that naturally buried leaf Litter is swiftly processed soon after entrainment and that repeating this experiment immediately after a flood may yield different results.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000076154400003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bburied%2Bleaf%2Blitter%2Band%2Bvertical%2Bhydrologic%2Bexchange%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Bwater%2Bchemistry%2Band%2Bfauna%2Bin%2Ba%2Bgravel-bed%2Briver%2Bin%2Bnorthern%2BNew%2BSouth%2BWales%252C%2BAustralia%26rft.aufirst%3DAJ%26rft.auinit%3DAJ%26rft.aulast%3DBoulton%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.1998.00345.x%26rft.epage%3D243%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D229-243%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D229%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DBoulton%252C%2BAJ%26rft.au%3DFoster%252C%2BJG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00345.x,,"SONORAN DESERT STREAM,SEDIMENT GRANULOMETRY,ORGANIC-MATTER,ZONE,INVERTEBRATES,DYNAMICS,MACROINVERTEBRATES,PERSPECTIVES,GROUNDWATER,COMMUNITIES",,"Univ New England, Div Ecosyst Management, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia"
16,16,"Whipple, AA",Jun 2019 ,Coupling landscapes and river flows to restore highly modified rivers,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Modifications to landscapes and flow regimes of rivers have altered the function, biodiversity, and productivity of freshwater ecosystems globally. Reestablishing geomorphological and hydrological conditions necessary to sustain ecosystems is a central challenge for restoration within highly altered systems. Meeting this challenge requires simultaneously addressing multiple and interacting stressors within the context of irreversible changes and socio-economic constraints. Traditionally, river restoration approaches either physically change the landscape or channel (channel-floodplain manipulation) or adjust hydrology (environmental flows), and such actions are often independent. We juxtapose these two subfields of river restoration, which have undergone parallel transformations, from goals of reproducing static representations of form and flow regime to goals of reestablishing processes. The parallel transformations have generated shared ideas, which point to benefits of coupling channel-floodplain manipulation and environmental flow actions to achieve process-based goals. Such coupling supports comprehensive river restoration efforts aimed at supporting resilient ecosystems within human dominated landscapes in a nonstationary climate. We identify four elements of coupled approaches for restoring highly modified rivers: (1) identify physical and ecological process potential given interactive effects of altered landscapes and flows; (2) consider capacity for sustaining identified processes under potential future change; (3) model alternatives for coupled restoration actions to support identified processes; and (4) evaluate alternatives using metrics representing integrative effects of coupled actions. We suggest these emergent elements contribute to the development of standard practices for restoring highly modified rivers and encourage an increasing number and quality of coupled applications.Plain Language Summary Freshwater ecosystems globally have been fundamentally altered and degraded by multiple human modifications of rivers, which have affected the amount and timing of water availability as well as the riverine landscape with which river flows interact. Knowing that it is often impossible or infeasible to completely reverse these impacts, a central challenge for restoring freshwater ecosystems of highly modified rivers is to determine what water management changes and physical habitat restoration actions can be taken to reestablish processes necessary to support ecosystems. These different river restoration approaches have traditionally been considered independently of one another. However, both river restoration subfields have shifted in recent decades from goals of reproducing static representations of channel forms or reference flow regimes to those of reestablishing processes driven by flow-landscape interaction. This shared understanding points to the benefits of coupling channel-floodplain manipulation and water management for a combined added positive impact to ecosystems. Four elements of coupled approaches are identified: (1) identify process potential; (2) consider capacity under potential future change; (3) model alternatives; and (4) evaluate metrics of integrative effects. This commentary supports the development of standard practices for coupled approaches for restoring highly modified rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000477616900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupling%2Blandscapes%2Band%2Briver%2Bflows%2Bto%2Brestore%2Bhighly%2Bmodified%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DAA%26rft.aulast%3DWhipple%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2018WR022783%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.epage%3D4532%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D4512-4532%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D4512%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DWhipple%252C%2BAA%26rft.au%3DViers%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2018WR022783,"river restoration,habitat restoration,environmental flows,hydrogeomorphology,process based,highly modified rivers","CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS,ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS,FRESH-WATER,ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION,LAND-USE,HYDROLOGIC ALTERATION,WETLAND CONNECTIVITY,HABITAT RESTORATION,STREAM RESTORATION,REGULATED RIVERS",,"San Francisco Estuary Inst, Richmond, CA 94804 USA"
17,17,"Li, MJ",Jun 2020 ,Nitrate bioreduction dynamics in hyporheic zone sediments under cyclic changes of chemical compositions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Hyporheic zone (HZ) is the hotspot of contaminant biotransformation in ecosystems that affects water quality in both groundwater and river water. HZ is characterized by its dynamic changes in water flow direction that lead to the cyclic changes in aqueous chemical compositions such as dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and their concentrations. Here we report a study on the effects of cyclic changes in the chemical conditions on the rates of nitrate bioreduction in sediments from a hyporheic zone, and the corresponding dynamics of the synthesis and decay of nitrate reductases. The results indicated that the rate of nitrate bioreduction in the second and third cycles was faster than that in the first one because the nitrate reductases produced in the first cycle still partially maintained their reactivity. The presence of DO significantly decreased the rates of nitrate reduction and nitrate reductase synthesis, but such an inhibition effect diminished in the later cycle. The coupled changes in nitrate concentrations and functional enzymes and genes abundances were generally consistent with an enzyme-based biogeochemical kinetic model. Overall the results indicated that enzyme growth dynamics and functions were complexly affected by the cyclic changes of environmental conditions, and implied that HZ sediments have a memory-type system behavior in reducing nitrate that would be affected by the frequency and magnitude of groundwater and river water exchanges, and chemical compositions in the groundwater and river water.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000544230000084,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124836%26rft.atitle%3DNitrate%2Bbioreduction%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bsediments%2Bunder%2Bcyclic%2Bchanges%2Bof%2Bchemical%2Bcompositions%26rft.aufirst%3DMinjing%26rft.auinit%3DMJ%26rft.aulast%3DLi%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.124836%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D585%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BMJ%26rft.au%3DLi%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BCX&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124836,"Hyporheic zone,Cyclic changes of chemical compositions,Nitrate bioreduction,Functional enzyme dynamics,Dissolved oxygen","PSEUDOMONAS-DENITRIFICANS,REDUCTIVE IMMOBILIZATION,AEROBIC DENITRIFICATION,ORGANIC-MATTER,OXYGEN,TRANSFORMATION,GROUNDWATER,REDUCTASES,GROWTH,WATER",,"Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Xueyuan Rd, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China"
18,18,"Johnson, ZC",Oct 2015 ,A numerical investigation of the potential impact of stream restoration on in-stream N removal,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Wastewater treatment plants are common point sources of nutrients to streams. Excess loading of nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N), can result in significant water quality degradation. Where stream loading cannot be increased by water quality trading with other point or nonpoint sources, stream restoration may be an alternative means for point sources to increase loading while maintaining or improving stream health by increasing in-stream N removal via denitrification. However, the primary drivers of nitrogen removal are currently not well understood and thus optimizing restoration efforts is difficult. A two-storage zone transport model with Michaelis-Menten uptake kinetics was applied to a river system based on the Truckee River of Nevada to simulate N removal for multiple restoration scenarios and different types of nitrogen loading. Rates of N removal were found to be most sensitive to the size of the hyporheic zone (AHTS) and maximum denitrification rate in the hyporheic zone (U'(max,HTS)), followed by the half-saturation concentration for denitrification (K-m,K-HTS). Graphs that incorporate the ranges of these three parameters indicate the potential effectiveness of restoration activities for increasing N removal. Combining restoration targets (e.g., increasing A(HTS), sinuosity, width-to-depth ratio, etc.) provided more N removal than the sum of N removal from the individual targets. The relative fractions of the three nitrogen species (dissolved organic-N, total ammonia-N, and nitrate-N) was found to significantly affect a stream's potential to remove N. Together, these results can be used to help guide stream restoration activities to increase a stream's N removal capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

19,19,"Xia, XH",Feb 1 2017 ,Enhanced nitrogen loss from rivers through coupled nitrification-denitrification caused by suspended sediment,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Present-day estimations of global nitrogen loss (N-loss) are underestimated. Commonly, N-loss from rivers is thought to be caused by denitrification only in bed-sediments. However, coupled nitrification-denitrification occurring in overlying water with suspended sediments (SPS) where oxic and anoxic/low oxygen zones may coexist is ignored for N-loss in rivers. Here the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers were taken as examples to investigate the effect of SPS, which exists in many rivers of the world, on N loss through coupled nitrification-denitrification with nitrogen stable (N-15) isotopic tracer simulation experiments and in-situ investigation. The results showed even when SPS was surrounded by oxic waters, there were redox conditions that transitioned from an oxic surface layer to anoxic layer near the particle center, enabling coupled nitrification-denitrification to occur around SPS. The production rate of N-15(2) from (NH4+)-N-15-N (R15N2-production) increased with increasing SPS concentration ([SPS]) as a power function (R15N2-production = a. [SPS](b)) for both the SPS-water and bed sediment-SPS-water systems. The power-functional increase of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria population with [SPS] accounted for the enhanced coupled nitrification-denitrification rate in overlying water. SPS also accelerated denitrification, in bed-sediment due to increased NO3- concentration caused by SPS-mediated nitrification. For these two rivers, 1 g L-1 SPS will lead to N-loss enhancement by approximately 25-120%, and the enhancement increased with organic carbon content of SPS. Thus, we conclude that SPS in overlying water is a hot spot for nitrogen loss in river systems and current estimates of in-stream N-loss are underestimated without consideration of SPS; this may partially compensate for the current imbalance of global nitrogen inputs and sinks.

20,20,"Wondzell, SM",Mar 1996 ,Seasonal and storm dynamics of the hyporheic zone of a 4th-order mountain stream .1. Hydrologic processes,JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY,"The objective of this study was to quantify fluxes of ground water and advected channel water through the shallow aquifer adjacent to a 4th-order mountain stream. A network of wells was installed from 1989 to 1992. Water-table elevations were measured seasonally and during storms. These data were used to calibrate MODFLOW, a 2-dimensional groundwater flow model. The fluxes of water through the subsurface were estimated from the head distributions predicted by the model for 8 steady state model runs bracketing the observed range in baseflow conditions, and for 1 transient simulation of a large storm. The overall pattern of subsurface flow changed little over the course of the year, even though the relative flux of advected channel water and ground water changed among seasons and during storms. Apparently the longitudinal gradient of the main valley, the location of the stream, and the influence of secondary channels determined the pattern of subsurface flows. Subsurface fluxes through a gravel bar were dominated by advected channel water but fluxes through the floodplain were dominated by ground water. Flow rates were positively correlated to estimated stream discharge during base-flow periods, but decreased slightly during storms because of precipitation inputs to the aquifer. The mean residence time of water stored within the aquifer was approximately 10 d for the gravel bar and 30 d for the floodplain during baseflow periods. Even though precipitation during the simulated storm equaled 12% and 23% of the water stored in the gravel bar and the floodplain, respectively, the mean residence time of water remained long.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:A1996TX71600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSeasonal%2Band%2Bstorm%2Bdynamics%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ba%2B4th-order%2Bmountain%2Bstream%2B.1.%2BHydrologic%2Bprocesses%26rft.aufirst%3DSM%26rft.auinit%3DSM%26rft.aulast%3DWondzell%26rft.date%3D1996%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2307%252F1467429%26rft.epage%3D19%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0887-3593%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BNORTH%2BAMERICAN%2BBENTHOLOGICAL%2BSOCIETY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3-19%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BN%2BAM%2BBENTHOL%2BSOC%26rft.volume%3D15%26rft.au%3DWondzell%252C%2BSM%26rft.au%3DSwanson%252C%2BFJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+NORTH+AMERICAN+BENTHOLOGICAL+SOCIETY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2307/1467429,"hyporheic zone,advected channel water,ground water,groundwater flow models,streams,aquifer,water budget,flow path,geomorphology","CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,SURFACE-WATER,SLUG TEST,GROUNDWATER,ECOSYSTEMS,SEDIMENTS,NUTRIENT,RIVER,PERSPECTIVES,EXCHANGE",,"OREGON STATE UNIV,DEPT FOREST SCI,CORVALLIS,OR 97331, USA"
21,21,"Gibbins, CN",Feb 2016 ,Influence of groundwater chemistry on hyporheic invertebrate assemblages is revealed by fine-scale sampling,FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY,"Relationships between hydrochemistry and invertebrate assemblages were assessed at fine spatial scales within the hyporheic zone of an upland stream. Eighteen stacked colonisation samplers were placed in the streambed and sampled regularly over an 8-month period. Each stack consisted of three individual sampling chambers, positioned at mean depths of 15, 30 and 45 cm below the bed surface. Each chamber had an internal volume of 600 cm(3) and was filled with sediment in the 2-8 mm (b-axis) size range. Water was extracted from each chamber at approximately fortnightly intervals, to characterise its hydrochemistry (dissolved oxygen concentration and alkalinity) and infer the presence of groundwater. Six randomly selected stacks were removed in each of three seasons (winter, spring and summer), with invertebrates present inside then identified and enumerated. Despite marked inter-sample differences in hydrochemistry and the variable presence of groundwater within the hyporheic zone, sampling locations were characterised by broadly similar invertebrate assemblages. Generalised linear mixed models indicated that inter-sample differences in assemblages were primarily related to depth beneath the streambed rather than local hydrochemical conditions, indicating only a limited effect of groundwater discharge on hyporheic communities in this stream. Overall, the chambers revealed finer spatial scale variation than methods used in previous published studies and allowed environmental and ecological characterisation at comparable spatial scales. Future studies using such chambers should seek to increase the number of measured covariates, to better understand the controls on invertebrate assemblages.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000370959900003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bgroundwater%2Bchemistry%2Bon%2Bhyporheic%2Binvertebrate%2Bassemblages%2Bis%2Brevealed%2Bby%2Bfine-scale%2Bsampling%26rft.aufirst%3DC.%2BN.%26rft.auinit%3DCN%26rft.aulast%3DGibbins%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1127%252Ffal%252F2016%252F0787%26rft.epage%3D221%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1863-9135%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DFUNDAMENTAL%2BAND%2BAPPLIED%2BLIMNOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D207-221%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D207%26rft.stitle%3DFUND%2BAPPL%2BLIMNOL%26rft.volume%3D187%26rft.au%3DGibbins%252C%2BCN%26rft.au%3DGrant%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DSoulsby%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=FUNDAMENTAL+AND+APPLIED+LIMNOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1127/fal/2016/0787,"Hyporheic invertebrates,water chemistry,groundwater-surface water interactions,colonisation chambers","SURFACE-WATER INTERACTIONS,CLIMATE-CHANGE,INTERSTITIAL COMMUNITIES,HYDROLOGICAL EXCHANGE,EMBRYO SURVIVAL,ZONE,STREAM,RIVER,HABITAT,FLOW",,"Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Northern Rivers Inst, St Marys Bldg,Elphinstone Rd, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland"
22,22,"Jaeger, A",Dec 1 2019 ,Using recirculating flumes and a response surface model to investigate the role of hyporheic exchange and bacterial diversity on micropollutant half-lives,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS,"Enhancing the understanding of the fate of wastewater-derived organic micropollutants in rivers is crucial to improve risk assessment, regulatory decision making and river management. Hyporheic exchange and sediment bacterial diversity are two factors gaining increasing importance as drivers for micropollutant degradation, but are complex to study in field experiments and usually ignored in laboratory tests aimed to estimate environmental half-lives. Flume mesocosms are useful to investigate micropollutant degradation processes, bridging the gap between the field and batch experiments. However, few studies have used flumes in this context. We present a novel experimental setup using 20 recirculating flumes and a response surface model to study the influence of hyporheic exchange and sediment bacterial diversity on half-lives of the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) and the artificial sweetener acesulfame (ACS). The effect of bedform-induced hyporheic exchange was tested by three treatment levels differing in number of bedforms (0, 3 and 6). Three levels of sediment bacterial diversity were obtained by diluting sediment from the River Erpe in Berlin, Germany, with sand (1 : 10, 1 : 1000 and 1 : 100 000). Our results show that ACS half-lives were significantly influenced by sediment dilution and number of bedforms. Half-lives of CBZ were higher than ACS, and were significantly affected only by the sediment dilution variable, and thus by bacterial diversity. Our results show that (1) the flume-setup is a useful tool to study the fate of micropollutants in rivers, and that (2) higher hyporheic exchange and bacterial diversity in the sediment can increase the degradation of micropollutants in rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000502303700008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DUsing%2Brecirculating%2Bflumes%2Band%2Ba%2Bresponse%2Bsurface%2Bmodel%2Bto%2Binvestigate%2Bthe%2Brole%2Bof%2Bhyporheic%2Bexchange%2Band%2Bbacterial%2Bdiversity%2Bon%2Bmicropollutant%2Bhalf-lives%26rft.aufirst%3DAnna%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DJaeger%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1039%252Fc9em00327d%26rft.eissn%3D2050-7895%26rft.epage%3D2108%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2050-7887%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE-PROCESSES%2B%2526%2BIMPACTS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2093-2108%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2093%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI-PROC%2BIMP%26rft.volume%3D21%26rft.au%3DJaeger%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DColl%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DLewandowski%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE-PROCESSES+%26+IMPACTS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1039/c9em00327d,,"ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER ACESULFAME,IN-STREAM ATTENUATION,WASTE-WATER TREATMENT,TRANSFORMATION PRODUCTS,OECD 308,ENVIRONMENTAL FATE,PHARMACEUTICALS,BIODEGRADATION,SEDIMENT,BIOTRANSFORMATION",,"Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecohydrol, Berlin, Germany"

For the coupled models, finite element method was used to solve the governing equations so as to study tidal rivers with complex topography. Since the 1D and 2D models were coupled, the principle of model coupling was proposed to account appropriately for the factors of water level, flow and pollutant flux and the related dynamical behavior was simulated. Specifically the models were used to probe quantitative pollution contribution of receiving water from neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces to the pollution in the Huangpu River passing through Shanghai City.

24,24,"Woelfle-Erskine, C",Feb 2017 ,Abiotic habitat thresholds for salmonid over-summer survival in intermittent streams,ECOSPHERE,"Intermittent streams lose surface flow during part of the year but can provide important habitat for imperiled fishes in residual pools. However, extended intermittency can drive high mortality as pool contraction decreases pool quality, and some pools dry completely. We evaluated the influence of a suite of abiotic habitat characteristics on the over-summer survival of two imperiled salmonid fishes (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch; steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) at four study sites on two tributaries of Salmon Creek (Sonoma County, California, USA) from 2012 to 2014, during deepening drought conditions. Study sites spanned an intermittency gradient from continuous flow to near-dry conditions, and included alluvial and bedrock stream reaches. We estimated over-summer survival at the pool scale from fish presence-absence data based on paired early-late summer snorkel surveys. We measured pool dimensions and water quality parameters monthly (more frequently during summer dry down) and, in 2013 and 2014, recorded water quality with continuous loggers in selected pools. We performed: (1) logistic regression in a generalized linear modeling framework to identify factors limiting over-summer survival and (2) classification trees using the random forests ensemble learning method to identify abiotic thresholds for sustaining sal-monids. Results suggested that different factors governed mortality of the two species. Coho salmon, which tended to survive in large, deep pools, were limited by minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In contrast, steelhead trout, which tended to survive in pools with large surface area, were sensitive to pool geometry and temperature. Both species persisted for weeks in large pools with low DO levels, including in pools where at least part of the water column reached sublethal or lethal levels. Our results suggest that shallow, lateral hyporheic flow may be important for maintaining DO and temperatures suitable for sustaining salmonids in isolated pools, whereas groundwater discharge originating from deeper flow paths may generate low-DO conditions that inhibit salmonid persistence. Geomorphically complex watersheds with a variety of pool geometries and high rates of lateral hyporheic exchange are those most likely to serve as ""sanctuary reaches"" for imperiled Pacific salmonid populations in semi-arid regions in the context of a changing climate.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000397091300032,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B01645%26rft.atitle%3DAbiotic%2Bhabitat%2Bthresholds%2Bfor%2Bsalmonid%2Bover-summer%2Bsurvival%2Bin%2Bintermittent%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DCleo%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DWoelfle-Erskine%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fecs2.1645%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2150-8925%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSPHERE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOSPHERE%26rft.volume%3D8%26rft.au%3DWoelfle-Erskine%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DLarsen%252C%2BLG%26rft.au%3DCarlson%252C%2BSM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=ECOSPHERE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/ecs2.1645,"drought,hyporheic flow,intermittent streams,salmonids,water quality","FISH COMMUNITY STRUCTURE,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN,JUVENILE SALMONIDS,CALIFORNIA STREAMS,ATLANTIC SALMON,DROUGHT RISK,CHUM SALMON,COHO SALMON,STEELHEAD,TROUT",,"Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, 310 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA USA"

The two rivers, being Martuwarra Fitzroy River (Kimberley, Western Australia) and Unamen Shipu Romaine River (North Shore, Quebec, Canada), illustrate a common condition of being, through heritage, life, change and possibility. Through stories and voices, the socio-scientific implications of colonisation and lost connections become clear, considering the interaction, the dialogue and the cultural synthesis of living water systems that have always incorporated all life forms into rivers of life. As a way of navigating towards wholeness, Aboriginal knowledge systems and narratives for healing are used to bring together findings of this intercultural river learning journey.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000695860600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHearing%252C%2Bvoicing%2Band%2Bhealing%253A%2BRivers%2Bas%2Bculturally%2Blocated%2Band%2Bconnected%26rft.aufirst%3DAnne%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DPoelina%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Frra.3843%26rft.eissn%3D1535-1467%26rft.epage%3D434%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1535-1459%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DRIVER%2BRESEARCH%2BAND%2BAPPLICATIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D422-434%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D422%26rft.stitle%3DRIVER%2BRES%2BAPPL%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DPoelina%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DWooltorton%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DDurand%252C%2BGS&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=RIVER+RESEARCH+AND+APPLICATIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/rra.3843,"living water systems,Martuwarra Fitzroy River,River Spirit,rivers of life,river voices,sentience,Unamen Shipu Romaine River",,,"Univ Notre Dame Australia, Nulungu Res Inst, Broome Campus, Broome, Australia"
28,28,"Kraft, M",Apr 2019 ,Prioritizing Stream Barrier Removal to Maximize Connected Aquatic Habitat and Minimize Water Scarcity,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Instream barriers, such as dams, culverts, and diversions, alter hydrologic processes and aquatic habitat. Removing uneconomical and aging instream barriers is increasingly used for river restoration. Historically, selection of barrier removal projects used score-and-rank techniques, ignoring cumulative change and the spatial structure of stream networks. Likewise, most water supply models prioritize either human water uses or aquatic habitat, failing to incorporate both human and environmental water use benefits. Here, a dual-objective optimization model identifies barriers to remove that maximize connected aquatic habitat and minimize water scarcity. Aquatic habitat is measured using monthly average streamflow, temperature, channel gradient, and geomorphic condition as indicators of aquatic habitat suitability. Water scarcity costs are minimized using economic penalty functions while a budget constraint specifies the money available to remove barriers. We demonstrate the approach using a case study in Utah's Weber Basin to prioritize removal of instream barriers for Bonneville cutthroat trout, while maintaining human water uses. Removing 54 instream barriers reconnects about 160 km of quality-weighted habitat and costs approximately US$10 M. After this point, the cost-effectiveness of removing barriers to connect river habitat decreases. The modeling approach expands barrier removal optimization methods by explicitly including both economic and environmental water uses.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000464285900009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPrioritizing%2BStream%2BBarrier%2BRemoval%2Bto%2BMaximize%2BConnected%2BAquatic%2BHabitat%2Band%2BMinimize%2BWater%2BScarcity%26rft.aufirst%3DMaggi%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DKraft%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252F1752-1688.12718%26rft.eissn%3D1752-1688%26rft.epage%3D400%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1093-474X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BTHE%2BAMERICAN%2BWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BASSOCIATION%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D382-400%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D382%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BAM%2BWATER%2BRESOUR%2BAS%26rft.volume%3D55%26rft.au%3DKraft%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DRosenberg%252C%2BDE%26rft.au%3DNull%252C%2BSE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+THE+AMERICAN+WATER+RESOURCES+ASSOCIATION&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/1752-1688.12718,"connectivity,optimization,restoration,river,river network,trout","BONNEVILLE CUTTHROAT TROUT,ONCORHYNCHUS-CLARKI,MOVEMENT PATTERNS,BROOK TROUT,DAM REMOVAL,RIVER-BASIN,RESTORATION,PASSAGE,CONSERVATION,MANAGEMENT",,"Utah State Univ, Logan, UT 84322 USA"
29,29,"Maier, HS",Nov-dec 2011 ,Influence of Oscillating Flow on Hyporheic Zone Development,GROUND WATER,"The hyporheic zone is an ecologically important ecotone that describes the extent to which nutrient-rich surface waters penetrate the shallow subsurface adjacent to a flowing surface water body. Although steady-state models satisfactorily explain the incursion of surface water into the subsurface as a function of head gradients developed across streambed riffles, they fail to account for the depth that surface water is observed to penetrate the subsurface or for the extent to which the hyporheic zone develops adjacent to the stream channel. To investigate these issues, transient flow modeling has been conducted at the riffle scale and supported by data for an instrumented site in northern Ontario where stream-stage fluctuations are strictly regulated. Model results show that daily stream-stage fluctuations between 0.6 and 4 m produce oscillating solute flow paths that typically reduce residence times of water and solutes in the hyporheic zone from 60 days or more under steady-state conditions to less than 1 day. Furthermore, similar stream-stage fluctuations increase the depth that solutes pervade the subsurface and banks lateral to the stream from around 1 m under steady-state conditions to as much as 2 and 10 m, respectively. The results demonstrate that the transient flow conditions triggered in the subsurface by variable stream stage can exert a strong influence on hyporheic zone development and have important implications for the hyporheos. The results are especially important for hyporheic communities that may survive gradual changes to their living conditions by migrating to more hospitable aquatic habitats, but are unable to respond to rapid changes provoked by more extreme hydrological events.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000297070200010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DInfluence%2Bof%2BOscillating%2BFlow%2Bon%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BDevelopment%26rft.aufirst%3DHerb%2BS.%26rft.auinit%3DHS%26rft.aulast%3DMaier%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fj.1745-6584.2010.00794.x%26rft.epage%3D844%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D830-844%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D830%26rft.stitle%3DGROUND%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D49%26rft.au%3DMaier%252C%2BHS%26rft.au%3DHoward%252C%2BKWF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=GROUND+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00794.x,,"SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS,TRANSIENT STORAGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,STREAM,EXCHANGE,DYNAMICS,RIVER,GROUNDWATER,RETENTION,SEDIMENT",,"Univ Toronto Scarborough, Groundwater Res Grp, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada"
30,30,"Ghimire, B",Mar 1 2013 ,Hydrograph-based approach to modeling bacterial fate and transport in rivers,WATER RESEARCH,"A new approach, called hydrograph-based approach, is proposed for predicting bacterial concentrations in rivers. The new approach is relatively simple and efficient in terms of data requirements. It uses widely available hydrographs as the main input data for estimating flow and sediment transport parameters responsible for bacterial transport under varying flow conditions. The major component of the hydrograph-based approach is a new model, called VARTBacT model which is an extension of the Variable Residence Time (VART) model by including effects of unsteady flow, sediment transport, and bacterial decay/growth processes on bacterial transport and fate in rivers. The applicability of the new hydrograph-based approach is demonstrated through three case studies, each with distinct sediment and flow conditions: (1) steady low flow without sediment transport, (2) flood events with significant sediment transport due to watershed inputs, and (3) sediment resuspension from the streambed. While the sediment resuspension from streambed may be an important process for bacterial transport during high flows, results from this study indicate that the most important mechanism responsible for bacterial transport in streams is watershed loading during flood events and hyporheic exchange during low flow periods.

31,31,"Malzone, JM",Mar-apr 2016 ,Temporal Hyporheic Zone Response to Water Table Fluctuations,GROUNDWATER,"Expansion and contraction of the hyporheic zone due to temporal hydrologic changes between stream and riparian aquifer influence the biogeochemical cycling capacity of streams. Theoretical studies have quantified the control of groundwater discharge on the depth of the hyporheic zone; however, observations of temporal groundwater controls are limited. In this study, we develop the concept of groundwater-dominated differential hyporheic zone expansion to explain the temporal control of groundwater discharge on the hyporheic zone in a third-order stream reach flowing through glacially derived terrain typical of the Great Lakes region. We define groundwater-dominated differential expansion of the hyporheic zone as: differing rates and magnitudes of hyporheic zone expansion in response to seasonal vs. storm-related water table fluctuation. Specific conductance and vertical hydraulic gradient measurements were used to map changes in the hyporheic zone during seasonal water table decline and storm events. Planar and riffle beds were monitored in order to distinguish the cause of increasing hyporheic zone depth. Planar bed seasonal expansion of the hyporheic zone was of a greater magnitude and longer in duration (weeks to months) than storm event expansion (hours to days). In contrast, the hyporheic zone beneath the riffle bed exhibited minimal expansion in response to seasonal groundwater decline compared to storm related expansion. Results indicated that fluctuation in the riparian water table controlled seasonal expansion of the hyporheic zone along the planar bed. This groundwater induced hyporheic zone expansion could increase the potential for biogeochemical cycling and natural attenuation.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000373211200015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DTemporal%2BHyporheic%2BZone%2BResponse%2Bto%2BWater%2BTable%2BFluctuations%26rft.aufirst%3DJonathan%2BM.%26rft.auinit%3DJM%26rft.aulast%3DMalzone%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgwat.12352%26rft.eissn%3D1745-6584%26rft.epage%3D285%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0017-467X%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D274-285%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D274%26rft.stitle%3DGROUNDWATER%26rft.volume%3D54%26rft.au%3DMalzone%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DAnseeuw%252C%2BSK%26rft.au%3DAllen-King%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=GROUNDWATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gwat.12352,,"GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE,AQUIFER INTERACTIONS,MOUNTAIN STREAM,EXCHANGE,DYNAMICS,FLOW,HETEROGENEITY,RIVER,INTERFACE,CHANNEL",,"SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geol, 411 Cooke Hall Univ & Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA"
32,32,"Angradi, T",Mar 1998 ,An application of the plaster dissolution method for quantifying water velocity in the shallow hyporheic zone of an Appalachian stream system,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"1. A method for quantifying interstitial water velocity based on the dissolution rate of plaster of Paris standards was developed as part of a study of vertical, longitudinal (1-4 order sites) and seasonal variation in the biotic and physical characteristics of the shallow hyporheic zone (0-30 cm) of a headwater stream system in West Virginia, U.S.A.2. A calibration model was developed using a water velocity simulation tank to relate mass loss of plaster standards to water velocity and temperature. The model was then used to calculate water velocity through artificial substrata embedded in the shallow hyporheic zone of four stream reaches based on in situ mass loss of plaster standards.3. Water velocity in the hyporheic zone increased with stream order, was highest in early spring and winter during high stream base flows, and decreased with depth into the substratum. There was a strong interaction between depth and season: during periods of high stream discharge, water velocity through the upper level of the shallow hyporheic zone (0-10 cm into the substrate) increased disproportionately more than velocity at greater depths. Mean interstitial velocity in March ranged from 0 cm s(-1) in the lowest level (20-30 cm) to 3.5 cm s(-1) at the upper level (0-10 cm) at the first-order site, and from 2.5 cm s(-1) (20-30 cm) to 9.5 cm s(-1) (0-10 cm s(-1)) at the fourth-order site. Gradients in stream discharge and sediment permeability accounted for treatment effects.4. Use of calibrated data improved the ability to resolve among-season differences in interstitial water movement over the use of uncalibrated mass loss data. For some applications of the plaster standard method, empirical calibration may not be necessary.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000072885600009,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAn%2Bapplication%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bplaster%2Bdissolution%2Bmethod%2Bfor%2Bquantifying%2Bwater%2Bvelocity%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bshallow%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%2Bof%2Ban%2BAppalachian%2Bstream%2Bsystem%26rft.aufirst%3DT%26rft.auinit%3DT%26rft.aulast%3DAngradi%26rft.date%3D1998%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1046%252Fj.1365-2427.1998.00280.x%26rft.epage%3D315%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0046-5070%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D301-315%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D301%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D39%26rft.au%3DAngradi%252C%2BT%26rft.au%3DHood%252C%2BR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00280.x,,"VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION,HYDROLOGIC EXCHANGE,DESERT STREAM,RIVER,PERSPECTIVES,GROUNDWATER,SUBSTRATUM,PATTERNS,ECOLOGY,MOTION",,"US Forest Serv, NE Forest Expt Stn, Timber & Watershed Lab, Parsons, WV 26287 USA"

Water collection started at flow onset and continued, with weekly hyporheic-zone sampling. The water delta O-18 and delta D values were isotopically lighter in the beginning and heavier later in the season. D-excess measurements were used as an indicator of mixing because an evaporative signature was evident and distinguishable between 2 primary end-members (glacier meltwater and hyporheic zone). Hyporheic-zone influence on the channel water was variable with a strong control on streamwater chemistry, except at highest discharges. This work supports previous research indicating that Von Guerard Stream has a large, widespread hyporheic zone that varies in size with time and discharge. Andersen Creek, with a smaller hyporheic zone, displayed hyporheic-zone solute interaction through the influence from subsurface hypersaline flow. Overall, the evolution of Taylor Valley hyporheic-zone hydrology is described seasonally. In mid-December, the hyporheic zone is a dynamic system exchanging with the glacier meltwater in the channel, and with diminishing flow in January, the hyporheic zone drains back into the channel flow also impacting stream chemistry. This work adds new information on the role of hyporheic zone-stream interaction in these glacier meltwater streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000406839300007,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Btemporal%2Bstable%2Bisotopic%2B%2528delta%2BO-18%252C%2Bdelta%2BD%252C%2Bd-excess%2529%2Bcomparison%2Bin%2Bglacier%2Bmeltwater%2Bstreams%252C%2BTaylor%2BValley%252C%2BAntarctica%26rft.aufirst%3DDeborah%2BL.%26rft.auinit%3DDL%26rft.aulast%3DLeslie%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.11245%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D3083%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D17%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3069-3083%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3069%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D31%26rft.au%3DLeslie%252C%2BDL%26rft.au%3DWelch%252C%2BKA%26rft.au%3DLyons%252C%2BWB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.11245,"Andersen Creek,Antarctica,d-excess,hyporheic zone,stable isotopes delta O-18 and delta D,Taylor Valley,Von Guerard Stream","MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS,DEUTERIUM-EXCESS,TRANSIENT STORAGE,FRYXELL BASIN,POLAR DESERT,GEOCHEMISTRY,CONNECTIVITY,EVOLUTION,FLOW",,"Ohio State Univ, Byrd Polar & Climate Res Ctr, Mendenhall Lab 275, 120 S Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA"
34,34,"Huotari, J",Nov 16 2013 ,Efficient gas exchange between a boreal river and the atmosphere,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"The largest uncertainties in accurately resolving the role of rivers and streams in carbon cycling stem from difficulties in determining gas exchange between water and the atmosphere. So far, estimates for river-atmosphere gas exchange have lacked direct ecosystem-scale flux measurements not disturbing gas exchange across the air-water interface. We conducted the first direct riverine gas exchange measurements with eddy covariance in tandem with continuous surface water CO2 measurements in a large boreal river for 30 days. Our measured gas transfer velocity was, on average, 20.8 cm h(-1), which is clearly higher than the model estimates based on river channel morphology and water velocity, whereas our floating chambers gave comparable values at 17.3 cm h(-1). These results demonstrate that present estimates for riverine CO2 emissions are very likely too low. This result is also relevant to any other gases emitted, as their diffusive exchange rates are similarly proportional to gas transfer velocity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000327810800022,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEfficient%2Bgas%2Bexchange%2Bbetween%2Ba%2Bboreal%2Briver%2Band%2Bthe%2Batmosphere%26rft.aufirst%3DJussi%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DHuotari%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013GL057705%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D5686%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D21%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5683-5686%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5683%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DHuotari%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DHaapanala%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DOjala%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013GL057705,"gas transfer velocity,k(600),eddy covariance,river","SURFACE TURBULENCE,TRANSFER VELOCITY,CARBON,WATER,DYNAMICS,STREAMS,FLUXES,CYCLE",,"Univ Helsinki, Lammi Biol Stn, Paajarventie 320, FI-16900 Lammi, Finland"
35,35,"Fuller, IC",May 2018 ,The science of connected ecosystems: What is the role of catchment-scale connectivity for healthy river ecology?,LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,"Riverine biological communities are highly resilient to extreme flood and/or drying disturbance regimes that would otherwise be destructive because these organisms can recolonise from upstream, floodplain, or hyporheic refugia when suitable conditions return. Healthy rivers require a high degree of connectivity to support complex life cycles of many lotic organisms and associated ecosystem functioning. Similarly, connectivity is required for appropriate geophysical functioning; permitting flux of water and sediment that drives channel-forming and ecological processes. Ecological and geophysical processes have operated in this temporal and spatial patchwork of disturbance and recovery pre-Anthropocene. Human impacts are increasing constraints on river and floodplain connectivity, severing many natural pathways, and degrading river ecosystem functioning. River restoration seeks to re-establish some of those biological and physical connections to enhance some level of system health. However, increasing sediment connectivity may be detrimental to river health in some instances. Strongly connected catchments can transmit excessive quantities of sediment from inappropriate land management, detrimental invasive species can spread more widely, and many ecosystem processes can exceed positive feedback control. Simply restoring connectivity will not necessarily lead to healthy river ecosystems. River management requires a greater understanding of how and when connectivity can and should be restored. Although current thinking is often that greater connectivity is better, we illustrate with examples from New Zealand rivers that this is not always the case. The benefits and costs of maintaining or restoring river connectivity need to be given as much attention as the restoration and maintenance of river systems per se.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000433587400010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bscience%2Bof%2Bconnected%2Becosystems%253A%2BWhat%2Bis%2Bthe%2Brole%2Bof%2Bcatchment-scale%2Bconnectivity%2Bfor%2Bhealthy%2Briver%2Becology%253F%26rft.aufirst%3DIan%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DIC%26rft.aulast%3DFuller%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fldr.2903%26rft.eissn%3D1099-145X%26rft.epage%3D1426%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1085-3278%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DLAND%2BDEGRADATION%2B%2526%2BDEVELOPMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1413-1426%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1413%26rft.stitle%3DLAND%2BDEGRAD%2BDEV%26rft.volume%3D29%26rft.au%3DFuller%252C%2BIC%26rft.au%3DDeath%252C%2BRG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=LAND+DEGRADATION+%26+DEVELOPMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/ldr.2903,"freshwater ecology,geomorphology,hydrologic connectivity,sediment connectivity,stream health","FRESH-WATER FISH,BENTHIC INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES,NEW-SOUTH-WALES,NEW-ZEALAND,SEDIMENT CONNECTIVITY,HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY,LAND-USE,LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY,HEADWATER STREAMS,NORTH-ISLAND",,"Massey Univ, Sch Agr & Environm, Phys Geog Grp & Innovat River Solut, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand"
36,36,"Sun, X",Jan 15 2016 ,Improved simulation of river water and groundwater exchange in an alluvial plain using the SWAT model,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Hydrological interaction between surface and subsurface water systems has a significant impact on water quality, ecosystems and biogeochemistry cycling of both systems. Distributed models have been developed to simulate this function, but they require detailed spatial inputs and extensive computation time. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model is a semi-distributed model that has been successfully applied around the world. However, it has not been able to simulate the two-way exchanges between surface water and groundwater. In this study, the SWAT-landscape unit (LU) model - based on a catena method that routes flow across three LUs (the divide, the hillslope and the valley) - was modified and applied in the floodplain of the Garonne River. The modified model was called SWAT-LUD. Darcy's equation was applied to simulate groundwater flow. The algorithm for surface water-level simulation during flooding periods was modified, and the influence of flooding on groundwater levels was added to the model. Chloride was chosen as a conservative tracer to test simulated water exchanges. The simulated water exchange quantity from SWAT-LUD was compared with the output of a two-dimensional distributed model, surface-subsurface water exchange model. The results showed that simulated groundwater levels in the LU adjoining the river matched the observed data very well. Additionally, SWAT-LUD model was able to reflect the actual water exchange between the river and the aquifer. It showed that river water discharge has a significant influence on the surface-groundwater exchanges. The main water flow direction in the river/groundwater interface was from groundwater to river; water that flowed in this direction accounted for 65% of the total exchanged water volume. The water mixing occurs mainly during high hydraulic periods. Flooded water was important for the surface-subsurface water exchange process; it accounted for 69% of total water that flowed from the river to the aquifer. The new module also provides the option of simulating pollution transfer occurring at the river/groundwater interface at the catchment scale.

37,37,"Ibrahim, A",Feb 2018 ,Comparison of a vertically-averaged and a vertically-resolved model for hyporheic flow beneath a pool-riffle bedform,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The interaction between surface water and groundwater through the hyporheic zone is recognized to be important as it impacts the water quantity and quality in both flow systems. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is the most complete representation of a real-world hyporheic zone. However, 3D modeling requires extreme computational power and efforts; the sophistication is often significantly compromised by not being able to obtain the required input data accurately. Simplifications are therefore often needed. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of the vertically-averaged approximation compared to a more complete vertically-resolved model of the hyporheic zone. The groundwater flow was modeled by either a simple one-dimensional (1D) Dupuit approach or a two-dimensional (2D) horizontal/vertical model in boundary fitted coordinates, with the latter considered as a reference model. Both groundwater models were coupled with a 1D surface water model via the surface water depth. Applying the two models to an idealized pool-riffle sequence showed that the 1D Dupuit approximation gave comparable results in determining the characteristics of the hyporheic zone to the reference model when the stratum thickness is not very large compared to the surface water depth. Conditions under which the 1D model can provide reliable estimate of the seepage discharge, upwelling/downwelling discharges and locations, the hyporheic flow, and the residence time were determined.

38,38,"Gerke, M",Feb 10 2021 ,Can top-down effects of cypriniform fish be used to mitigate eutrophication effects in medium-sized European rivers?,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Eutrophication seriously threatens the ecological quality and biodiversity of running waters. In nutrient-enriched streams and shallow rivers, eutrophication leads to excessive periphyton growth and, in turn, biological clogging, oxygen depletion in the hyporheic zone and finally a reduction in the hyporheic habitat quality. Top-down control of the food-web by manipulating fish stocks, similar to the biomanipulation successfully applied in lakes, offers a promising approach to mitigating the effects of eutrophication in shallow rivers, especially those in which major reductions in nutrient input are not feasible. We conducted a reach-scale experiment over 4 years in a medium-sized eutrophic river to assess whether the top-down effects of two important large European cypriniform fish species, herbivorous common nase (Chondrostoma nasus) and omnivorous European chub (Squalius cephalus), would mitigate the effects of eutrophication. The enhancement of fish stocks was expected to reduce biological clogging, via the top-down control of periphyton by benthic grazing and enhanced bioturbation, thus increasing oxygen availability in the hyporheic zone as well as water exchange between the surface water and the hyporheic zone. As expected, enhancing the stocks of nase and chub increased both oxygen availability and vertical exchange flux of water in the upper layer of the hyporheic zone. However, periphyton biomass (chlorophyll a) was significantly reduced only in deeper pool habitat. Thus, while experimental biomanipulation in a shallow river significantly mitigated the effects of eutrophication in the hyporheic zone, top-down effects on periphyton biomass were rather small. Overall, to our knowledge, our results provide first evidence that the biomanipulation achieved by enhancing herbivorous and omnivorous fish stocks has the potential to mitigate the effects of eutrophication in medium-sized European rivers.

39,39,"Bobeldyk, AM",2005 ,Secondary spread of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in coupled lake-stream systems,ECOSCIENCE,"We postulated that dispersal through streams is an important factor in the spread of nonindigenous aquatic species to uninvaded lakes. We tested this hypothesis with zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), whose plank-tonic larvae are particularly prone to transport through streams. To examine this potential mechanism of spread, we (1) assessed populations of zebra mussels in 2000 and 2003 in coupled lake-stream systems of the St. Joseph River basin (Indiana and Michigan, USA) and (2) examined the interconnectedness of lake-stream systems by evaluating all invaded inland lakes and reservoirs in the United States. We compared observed patterns in zebra mussel populations in 2000 and 2003 to patterns predicted by two proposed models of spread: the static source-sink model and the progressive downstream-march model. Adult zebra mussel densities in lake outflows declined with distance downstream of invaded lakes. Maximum downstream occurrences of adults were variable over the years surveyed, but did not increase through time, suggesting that the source-sink model best fit zebra mussel distributions in these lake-stream couplets. For the conterminous US, we examined the connectedness of inland lakes in close proximity to invaded takes to determine if stream connections were related to invasions. We also measured the distances between invaded lakes and downstream lakes that were potential recipients of colonists to examine the importance of stream distance in relation to zebra mussel invasions. Lakes connected to invaded lakes were more likely to be invaded than non-connected lakes, and the probability of becoming invaded increased with the proximity between lakes. Our results suggest that a better understanding of the role that streams play as pathways for new biological invasions is crucial for directing management and prevention efforts.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000232582200006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSecondary%2Bspread%2Bof%2Bzebra%2Bmussels%2B%2528Dreissena%2Bpolymorpha%2529%2Bin%2Bcoupled%2Blake-stream%2Bsystems%26rft.aufirst%3DAM%26rft.auinit%3DAM%26rft.aulast%3DBobeldyk%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.2980%252Fi1195-6860-12-3-339.1%26rft.eissn%3D2376-7626%26rft.epage%3D346%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1195-6860%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DECOSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D339-346%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D339%26rft.stitle%3DECOSCIENCE%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DBobeldyk%252C%2BAM%26rft.au%3DBossenbroek%252C%2BJM%26rft.au%3DLamberti%252C%2BGA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=ECOSCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.2980/i1195-6860-12-3-339.1,"biological invasions,native mussels,nonindigenous species,source-sink dynamics,stream-lake connections,zebra mussels","OVERLAND DISPERSAL,WATER-QUALITY,INVASION,RIVER,IMPACTS,RISK,RECRUITMENT,LARVAL",,"Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA"
40,40,"Ryan, RJ",Jan 6 2004 ,Estimation of solute transport and storage parameters in a stream with anthropogenically produced unsteady flow and industrial bromide input,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"We used an anthropogenic tracer signal to evaluate downstream solute transport and storage in Valley Creek, a 60 km(2) watershed stream near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that is subject to urbanization and anthropogenically induced unsteady flow. Bromide-bearing groundwater from an abandoned mineral processing plant enters the upstream reach of Valley Creek through a series of well-defined seeps and springs, producing a steady and significant concentration of bromide in Valley Creek. In addition, at the time of the study, a quarry located near the center of the watershed discharged accumulated groundwater seepage to the stream on a cyclical basis. The quarry discharge reduced the bromide concentration in the main stream and produced a periodicity in the in-stream bromide concentration downstream of the quarry. We used these variations in the ambient bromide concentration to assess solute mixing and transport in Valley Creek. We applied the USGS code OTIS to analyze solute advection, dispersion, transient storage, and groundwater inflow over a 7.5 km stream reach. To apply OTIS for unsteady flow conditions, we independently modeled the variation of stream conditions during a flow cycle and then simulated solute transport using temporal and reach average values of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient (D), transient storage exchange rate (alpha), and transient storage area (A(s)/A). Calibrated values of D ranged from 0.5 m(2) s(-1) to 1.4 m(2) s(-1), A(s)/A ranged from 0.03 to 1.3, and a ranged from 8.7 x 10(-6) s(-1) to 1.0 x 10(-2) s(-1). Observed temporal variability in the in-stream bromide concentration was simulated well. The observed transient storage parameters reflect differences in the structure of the three test reaches. Solute storage in the middle reach was dominated by in-stream storage produced by relict hydraulic structures, while solute transport in the other two reaches reflected differences in bed sediment characteristics between upstream and downstream reaches. However, overparameterization of the model and high sensitivity to the dispersion coefficient made it difficult to assess the magnitude of transient storage or hyporheic exchange.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000188288200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW01602%26rft.atitle%3DEstimation%2Bof%2Bsolute%2Btransport%2Band%2Bstorage%2Bparameters%2Bin%2Ba%2Bstream%2Bwith%2Banthropogenically%2Bproduced%2Bunsteady%2Bflow%2Band%2Bindustrial%2Bbromide%2Binput%26rft.aufirst%3DRJ%26rft.auinit%3DRJ%26rft.aulast%3DRyan%26rft.date%3D2004%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2003WR002458%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D40%26rft.au%3DRyan%252C%2BRJ%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BAI%26rft.au%3DWelty%252C%2BC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2003WR002458,"hyporheic exchange,solute transport,transient storage","TRANSIENT STORAGE,EXCHANGE",,"Drexel Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA"

In this study, we systematically evaluate how variations of gaining and losing conditions, stream discharge, and pool-riffle morphology affect aerobic respiration (AR) and denitrification (DN) in the HZ. For this purpose, a computational fluid dynamics model of stream water flow is coupled to a reactive transport model. Scenarios of variations of the solute concentration in the upwelling groundwater were conducted. Our results show that solute influx, residence time, and the size of reactive zones strongly depend on presence, magnitude, and direction of ambient groundwater flow. High magnitudes of ambient groundwater flow lower AR efficiency by up to 4 times and DN by up to 3 orders of magnitude, compared to neutral conditions. The influence of stream discharge and morphology on the efficiency of AR and DN are minor, in comparison to that of ambient groundwater flow. Different scenarios of O2 and NO3 concentrations in the upwelling groundwater reveal that DN efficiency of the HZ is highest under low upwelling magnitudes accompanied with low concentrations of O2 and NO3. Our results demonstrate how ambient groundwater flow influences solute transport, AR, and DN in the HZ. Neglecting groundwater flow in stream-groundwater interactions would lead to a significant overestimation of the efficiency of biogeochemical reactions in fluvial systems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000337607900014,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DHyporheic%2Btransport%2Band%2Bbiogeochemical%2Breactions%2Bin%2Bpool-riffle%2Bsystems%2Bunder%2Bvarying%2Bambient%2Bgroundwater%2Bflow%2Bconditions%26rft.aufirst%3DNico%26rft.auinit%3DN%26rft.aulast%3DTrauth%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013JG002586%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D928%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D910-928%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D910%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D119%26rft.au%3DTrauth%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DSchmidt%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DFleckenstein%252C%2BJH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013JG002586,"hyporheic zone,pool-riffle,streambed,reactive transport modeling,denitrification","SURFACE-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE,SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE,N-RICH STREAM,NITROGEN-RETENTION,ZONE,DENITRIFICATION,DYNAMICS,NITRATE,RIVER,OXYGEN",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Hydrogeol, Leipzig, Germany"
42,42,"Gonzalez-Pinzon, R",Mar 2015 ,A field comparison of multiple techniques to quantify groundwater-surface-water interactions,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Groundwater-surface-water (GW-SW) interactions in streams are difficult to quantify because of heterogeneity in hydraulic and reactive processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The challenge of quantifying these interactions has led to the development of several techniques, from centimeter-scale probes to whole-system tracers, including chemical, thermal, and electrical methods. We co-applied conservative and smart reactive solute-tracer tests, measurement of hydraulic heads, distributed temperature sensing, vertical profiles of solute tracer and temperature in the stream bed, and electrical resistivity imaging in a 450-m reach of a 3(rd)-order stream. GW-SW interactions were not spatially expansive, but were high in flux through a shallow hyporheic zone surrounding the reach. NaCl and resazurin tracers suggested different surface-subsurface exchange patterns in the upper 2/3 and lower 1/3 of the reach. Subsurface sampling of tracers and vertical thermal profiles quantified relatively high fluxes through a 10- to 20-cm deep hyporheic zone with chemical reactivity of the resazurin tracer indicated at 3-, 6-, and 9-cm sampling depths. Monitoring of hydraulic gradients along transects with MINIPOINT streambed samplers starting approximate to 40 m from the stream indicated that groundwater discharge prevented development of a larger hyporheic zone, which progressively decreased from the stream thalweg toward the banks. Distributed temperature sensing did not detect extensive inflow of ground water to the stream, and electrical resistivity imaging showed limited large-scale hyporheic exchange. We recommend choosing technique(s) based on: 1) clear definition of the questions to be addressed (physical, biological, or chemical processes), 2) explicit identification of the spatial and temporal scales to be covered and those required to provide an appropriate context for interpretation, and 3) maximizing generation of mechanistic understanding and reducing costs of implementing multiple techniques through collaborative research.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000349995000012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DA%2Bfield%2Bcomparison%2Bof%2Bmultiple%2Btechniques%2Bto%2Bquantify%2Bgroundwater-surface-water%2Binteractions%26rft.aufirst%3DRicardo%26rft.auinit%3DR%26rft.aulast%3DGonzalez-Pinzon%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F679738%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D160%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D139-160%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D139%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D34%26rft.au%3DGonzalez-Pinzon%252C%2BR%26rft.au%3DWard%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DBrock%252C%2BJT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/679738,"stream-groundwater,hyporheic exchange,transient storage,resazurin,tracers,distributed temperature sensing,DTS,heat as a tracer,electrical resistivity,hydraulic head","SOLUTE TRANSPORT,HYPORHEIC ZONE,TIME-SERIES,TRANSIENT STORAGE,HEADWATER STREAMS,TRACER,RIVER,HEAT,DISCHARGE,EXCHANGE",,"Univ New Mexico, Dept Civil Engn, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA"
43,43,"Hester, ET",Oct 2016 ,Vertical surface water-groundwater exchange processes within a headwater floodplain induced by experimental floods,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Restoring hydrologic connectivity between channels and floodplains is common practice in stream and river restoration. Floodplain hydrology and hydrogeology impact stream hydraulics, ecology, biogeochemical processing, and pollutant removal, yet rigorous field evaluations of surface water-groundwater exchange within floodplains during overbank floods are rare. We conducted five sets of experimental floods to mimic floodplain reconnection by pumping stream water onto an existing floodplain swale. Floods were conducted throughout the year to capture seasonal variation and each involved two replicate floods on successive days to test the effect of varying antecedent moisture. Water levels and specific conductance were measured in surface water, soil, and groundwater within the floodplain, along with surface flow into and out of the floodplain. Vegetation density varied seasonally and controlled the volume of surface water storage on the floodplain. By contrast, antecedent moisture conditions controlled storage of water in floodplain soils, with drier antecedent moisture conditions leading to increased subsurface storage and slower flood wave propagation across the floodplain surface. The site experienced spatial heterogeneity in vertical connectivity between surface water and groundwater across the floodplain surface, where propagation of hydrostatic pressure, preferential flow, and bulk Darcy flow were all mechanisms that may have occurred during the five floods. Vertical connectivity also increased with time, suggesting higher frequency of floodplain inundation may increase surface water-groundwater exchange across the floodplain surface. Understanding the variability of floodplain impacts on water quality noted in the literature likely requires better accounting for seasonal variations in floodplain vegetation and antecedent moisture as well as heterogeneous exchange flow mechanisms.

At the global scale, the total river-atmosphere flux of trace gasses such as carbon dioxide depends on the proportion of Earth's surface that is covered by the fluvial network, yet the total surface area of rivers and streams is poorly constrained. We used a global database of planform river hydromorphology and a statistical approach to show that global river and stream surface area at mean annual discharge is 773,000 +/- 79,000 square kilometers (0.58 +/- 0.06%) of Earth's nonglaciated land surface, an area 44 +/- 15% larger than previous spatial estimates.

Through field monitoring, the reduction rate of each pollutant per unit length of river reach and its correlation with the corresponding sinuosity were analysed. The results show that river sinuosity has different degrees of positive correlation with the growth rate of dissolved oxygen (DO) and the reduction rates of total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP). River sinuosity needs to be above 1.42 to ensure the river's basic self-purification capability. We also discuss the mechanism of river sinuosity on water body self-purification and propose the increase in river sinuosity to improve the river's capacity to purify water from pollutants. This measure could enhance the growth rate of DO, the longitudinal hyporheic exchange flow, and the action time of other basic self-purification factors of the river.

46,46,"Yang, S",Aug 18 2021 ,Hortonian Scaling of Coupled Hydrological and Biogeochemical Responses Across an Intensively Managed River Basin,FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Structural and functional attributes across fractal river networks have been characterized by well-established and consistent hierarchical, Hortonian scaling patterns. In most of the global river basins, spatial patterns of human settlements also conform to similar hierarchical scaling. However, emergent spatial hierarchical patterns and scaling of heterogeneous anthropogenic nutrient loads over a river basin are less known. As a case study, we examined here a large intensely managed river basin in Germany (Weser River; 46K km(2); 8M population). Archived data for point-/diffuse-sources of total Phosphorus (P-tot) input loads were combined with numerical and analytical model simulations of coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes for in-stream P-tot removal at the network scale. We find that P-tot input loads scale exponentially over stream-orders, with the larger scaling constant for point-source loads from urban agglomerations compared to those for diffuse-source contributions from agricultural and forested areas. These differences in scaling patterns result from hierarchical self-organization of human settlements, and the associated clustering of large-scale, altered land-cover. Fraction of P-tot loads removed through in-stream biogeochemical processes also manifests Hortonian scaling, consistent with predictions of an analytical model. Our analyses show that while smaller streams are more efficient in P-tot removal, in larger streams the magnitude of P-tot loads removed is higher. These trends are consistent with inverse scaling of nutrient removal rate constant with mean discharge, and downstream clustering of larger cumulative input loads. Analyses of six nested sub-basins within the Weser River Basin also reveal similar scaling patterns. Our findings are useful for projecting likely water-quality spatial patterns in similar river basins in Germany, and Central Europe. Extensions and generalizations require further examination of diverse basins with archetype spatial heterogeneities in anthropogenic pressures and hydroclimatic settings.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000693101700001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B693056%26rft.atitle%3DHortonian%2BScaling%2Bof%2BCoupled%2BHydrological%2Band%2BBiogeochemical%2BResponses%2BAcross%2Ban%2BIntensively%2BManaged%2BRiver%2BBasin%26rft.aufirst%3DSoohyun%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DYang%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffrwa.2021.693056%26rft.eissn%3D2624-9375%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BWATER%26rft.volume%3D3%26rft.au%3DYang%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DBertuzzo%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DRao%252C%2BPSC&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/frwa.2021.693056,"hierarchical scaling,river networks,phosphorus loadings,in-stream nutrient uptake,spatial heterogeneity","HYDRAULIC GEOMETRY,NITROGEN,REMOVAL,FLOW,EMISSIONS",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Aquat Ecosyst Anal & Management, Magdeburg, Germany"

In this review, we presented clogging mechanisms and their spatio-temporal variability in the context of a global stream functioning. Clogging modifies stream bottom and interstitial habitats characteristics and reduces the exchange of water and dissolved substances between the stream surface and the hyporheic zone. Modifications of substrate structure, substrate stability, oxygen and trophic resources and predator influence lead to changes in community structure. In a first step, drift increases whereas the invertebrate abundance drops. In a second step, likelihood to survive, growing, standing crop and productivity are affected. Coarse substrate adapted assemblages are progressively replaced by invertebrates adapted to fine sediments. The studies about consequences of clogging on the hyporheos are scarce, but the major role of the hyporheos on the dynamic of streams suggests that its alteration would strongly decrease the stream resilience capacity after disturbances.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000177628400006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Bclogging%2Bof%2Bstream%2Bbeds%253A%2BA%2Breview%2Bof%2Bmechanisms%2Band%2Bconsequences%2Bon%2Bhabitats%2Band%2Bmacroinvertebrate%2Bcommunities.%26rft.aufirst%3DS%26rft.auinit%3DS%26rft.aulast%3DGayraud%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1051%252Fkmae%253A2002039%26rft.epage%3D355%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0767-2861%26rft.issue%3D365-66%26rft.jtitle%3DBULLETIN%2BFRANCAIS%2BDE%2BLA%2BPECHE%2BET%2BDE%2BLA%2BPISCICULTURE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D339-355%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D339%26rft.stitle%3DB%2BFR%2BPECHE%2BPISCIC%26rft.au%3DGayraud%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DHerouin%252C%2BE%26rft.au%3DPhilippe%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=BULLETIN+FRANCAIS+DE+LA+PECHE+ET+DE+LA+PISCICULTURE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1051/kmae:2002039,"substrate,hyporheic zone,fine sediments,invertebrates,suspended sediment (SS)","FINE SEDIMENT,NEW-ZEALAND,SUSPENDED SEDIMENT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,HYPORHEIC ZONE,VALLEY-CREEK,RIVER,DRIFT,SURFACE,GROUNDWATER",,"Univ Lyon 1, Lab Ecol Eaux Douces & Grands Fleuves, CNRS, ESA 5023, 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France"
48,48,"Brookshire, ENJ",Sep 2005 ,Coupled cycling of dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon in a forest stream,ECOLOGY,"Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is an abundant but poorly understood pool of N in many ecosystems. We assessed DON cycling in a N-limited headwater forest stream via whole-ecosystem additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and labile dissolved organic matter (DOM), hydrologic transport and biogeochemical modeling, and laboratory experiments with native sediments. We sampled surface and subsurface waters to understand how interaction among hydrologic exchange, DIN, DON, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influence stream N losses at summer baseflow. Added DON was taken up rapidly from the water column at rates exceeding DOC and DIN. A significant fraction of this DON was mineralized and nitrified. Combined DON and NO3-N uptake lengths resulted in spiraling lengths of similar to 210 m, suggesting the potential for multiple. transformations of labile N loads within catchment boundaries. Simultaneous addition of DIN increased DOM uptake, but more so for C, resulting in an upward shift in the C:N ratio of uptake. Sediment incubations also showed a strong biotic influence on DOC and DON dynamics. Despite efficient uptake of added DOM, background DON and high molecular mass DOC concentrations increased downstream, resulting in higher DOM loads than could be accounted for by groundwater discharge and suggesting net release of less bioavailable forms from the channel/hyporheic zone. At the same time, subsurface DOM was characterized by very low C:N ratios and a disproportionately large DON pool despite rapid hydrologic mixing with dilute and high C:N ratio surface waters. Analysis of expected DON loads from conservative hyporheic fluxes indicated that watershed losses of DON would have been seven times greater in the absence of apparent benthic demand, suggesting tight internal cycling of subsurface DON. Our study further demonstrates the potential for significant transformation of N in headwater streams before export to downstream ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000231373600023,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCoupled%2Bcycling%2Bof%2Bdissolved%2Borganic%2Bnitrogen%2Band%2Bcarbon%2Bin%2Ba%2Bforest%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DENJ%26rft.auinit%3DENJ%26rft.aulast%3DBrookshire%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1890%252F04-1184%26rft.eissn%3D1939-9170%26rft.epage%3D2496%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0012-9658%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D2487-2496%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D2487%26rft.stitle%3DECOLOGY%26rft.volume%3D86%26rft.au%3DBrookshire%252C%2BENJ%26rft.au%3DValett%252C%2BHM%26rft.au%3DWebster%252C%2BJR&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1890/04-1184,"cycling,dissolved organic carbon,dissolved organic nitrogen,forest stream,head-water catchment,hydrologic losses,nutrient uptake,spiraling","DYNAMICS,NUTRIENT,WATERSHEDS,RETENTION,PATTERNS,TRANSPORT,NITRATE,MATTER,RIVERS",,"Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"
49,49,"Boykov, SY",Apr 2020 ,Evaluation of Irreversibility and Optimal Organization of an Integrated Multi-Stream Heat Exchange System,JOURNAL OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS,"This work proposes a structure synthesis and surface distribution algorithm in a heat exchange system for the case when all heat capacity rates and inlet temperatures of the hot streams are constant, while cold streams also have outlet temperatures set. The algorithm includes the possibility of changing the phase state of the contacting streams. The synthesis is based on minimization of dissipation for a given total heat load in the form of minimum total contact surface area, which again correlates with the cost of the heat exchange system. The proposed algorithm can be considered to follow a thermodynamic rationale and as development of pinch analysis.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000523564900005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEvaluation%2Bof%2BIrreversibility%2Band%2BOptimal%2BOrganization%2Bof%2Ban%2BIntegrated%2BMulti-Stream%2BHeat%2BExchange%2BSystem%26rft.aufirst%3DSergey%2BYurevish%26rft.auinit%3DSY%26rft.aulast%3DBoykov%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1515%252Fjnet-2019-0078%26rft.eissn%3D1437-4358%26rft.epage%3D171%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0340-0204%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BNON-EQUILIBRIUM%2BTHERMODYNAMICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D155-171%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D155%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BNON-EQUIL%2BTHERMODY%26rft.volume%3D45%26rft.au%3DBoykov%252C%2BSY%26rft.au%3DAndresen%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DTsirlin%252C%2BAM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0D710wcwwYudTkiMSrMHpOT&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+NON-EQUILIBRIUM+THERMODYNAMICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1515/jnet-2019-0078,"multi-stream heat exchange,optimization thermodynamics,heat exchange system synthesis",,,"RAS, Program Syst Inst, Pereslavl Zalesskii, Russia"
