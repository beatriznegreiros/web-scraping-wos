0,0,"Wohl, E",Jun 2017 ,Connectivity in rivers,PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT,"Connectivity describes the degree to which matter and organisms can move among spatially defined units in a natural system. River connectivity is typically described in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dimensions within the river corridor and the watershed and can be conceptualized as a continuum from fully connected to disconnected over diverse temporal and spatial scales. Explicit characterization of connectivity helps understanding of disparities among short-term, local rates of flux and inferred fluxes over larger scales. Connectivity also strongly influences the response of rivers to natural and human disturbances. Investigations of connectivity facilitate the recognition of processes that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries, as well as understanding of nonlinear behavior and retention within rivers. Enhancing the ability to identify, quantify, and predict the processes that create and maintain connectivity is integral to the effective management of rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000403608600006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DConnectivity%2Bin%2Brivers%26rft.aufirst%3DEllen%26rft.auinit%3DE%26rft.aulast%3DWohl%26rft.date%3D2017%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1177%252F0309133317714972%26rft.eissn%3D1477-0296%26rft.epage%3D362%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0309-1333%26rft.issue%3D3%26rft.jtitle%3DPROGRESS%2BIN%2BPHYSICAL%2BGEOGRAPHY-EARTH%2BAND%2BENVIRONMENT%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D345-362%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D345%26rft.stitle%3DPROG%2BPHYS%2BGEOG%26rft.volume%3D41&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=PROGRESS+IN+PHYSICAL+GEOGRAPHY-EARTH+AND+ENVIRONMENT&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1177/0309133317714972,"River,connectivity,management,retention,fluxes","SMALL MOUNTAINOUS RIVERS,OLD-GROWTH FOREST,HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY,SEDIMENT CONNECTIVITY,LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY,LONGITUDINAL CONNECTIVITY,CATCHMENT,WATER,STREAM,CHANNEL",,"Colorado State Univ, Dept Geosci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA"
1,1,"Lemke, D",May 2013 ,On-line fluorometry of multiple reactive and conservative tracers in streams,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"Performing tracer tests using artificial tracer compounds is a common practice to characterize natural streams regarding their (reactive) transport properties. Recently, the fluorescent compound resazurin was introduced as a reactive stream tracer to quantify hyporheic exchange and metabolic activity of streams. This tracer, together with its reaction product resorufin and a conservative tracer (in our case fluorescein), provides additional information about transport properties of the stream and its hyporheic zone and can therefore overcome restrictions that are commonly affiliated with the use of conservative tracers alone. However, all previously published studies using this tracer system were based on manual sampling of the water. This usually limits the number of measurements and thus the achievable temporal resolution, and potentially endangers data quality due to inadequate handling of samples. In this paper, a modified version of the GGUN-FL30 on-line fluorometer is presented in which the optics have been modified to allow measuring the concentrations of all three tracers simultaneously at intervals of 10 s. Experiments under controlled and natural conditions showed that the performance of the on-line fluorometer regarding tracer separation efficiency and practical detection limits is comparable to a high-performance laboratory spectrofluorometer. Furthermore, suggestions are given on how to correct tracer signal fluctuations caused by temporal changes in temperature and pH that might occur during a field tracer test.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000318280400004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOn-line%2Bfluorometry%2Bof%2Bmultiple%2Breactive%2Band%2Bconservative%2Btracers%2Bin%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DDennis%26rft.auinit%3DD%26rft.aulast%3DLemke%26rft.date%3D2013%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs12665-013-2305-3%26rft.epage%3D358%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1866-6280%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BEARTH%2BSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D349-358%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D349%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BEARTH%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D69%26rft.au%3DLemke%252C%2BD%26rft.au%3DSchnegg%252C%2BPA%26rft.au%3DCirpka%252C%2BOA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+EARTH+SCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s12665-013-2305-3,"Fluorometer,Tracer test,Groundwater/surface water interaction,Resazurin","FLUORESCENT DYE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,ZONE,EXCHANGE,DYNAMICS,DESIGN,OREGON,TESTS,RIVER",,"Univ Tubingen, Water & Earth Syst Sci Competence Cluster, WESS, Holderlinstr 12, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany"
2,2,"Dupuy, H",Aug 2015 ,On the importance of nonlinear couplings in large-scale neutrino streams,JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS,"We propose a procedure to evaluate the impact of nonlinear couplings on the evolution of massive neutrino streams in the context of large-scale structure growth. Such streams can be described by general nonlinear conservation equations, derived from a multiple-flow perspective, which generalize the conservation equations of non-relativistic pressureless fluids. The relevance of the nonlinear couplings is quantified with the help of the eikonal approximation applied to the subhorizon limit of this system. It highlights the role played by the relative displacements of different cosmic streams and it specifies, for each flow, the spatial scales at which the growth of structure is affected by nonlinear couplings. We found that, at redshift zero, such couplings can be significant for wavenumbers as small as k = 0.2 h/Mpc for most of the neutrino streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000365046600053,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B053%26rft.atitle%3DOn%2Bthe%2Bimportance%2Bof%2Bnonlinear%2Bcouplings%2Bin%2Blarge-scale%2Bneutrino%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DHelene%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DDupuy%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1088%252F1475-7516%252F2015%252F08%252F053%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1475-7516%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BCOSMOLOGY%2BAND%2BASTROPARTICLE%2BPHYSICS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BCOSMOL%2BASTROPART%2BP%26rft.au%3DDupuy%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DBernardeau%252C%2BF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+COSMOLOGY+AND+ASTROPARTICLE+PHYSICS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1088/1475-7516/2015/08/053,"cosmological neutrinos,cosmic flows,neutrino theory",COSMOLOGICAL PERTURBATION-THEORY,,"Univ Paris 06, Inst Astrophys Paris, UMR 7095, CNRS, 98 Bis Bd Arago, F-75014 Paris, France"
3,3,"Gong, C",Nov 2021 ,"Effects of stream ecosystem metabolisms on CO2 ( )emissions in two headwater catchments, Southeastern China",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Headwater streams, as critical zones due to their proximity to terrestrial sources, emit large quantities of CO2 owing to their higher drainage density of catchments, substantial total areas, and stream lengths. Stream ecosystem metabolism (EM, i.e. photosynthesis and respiration) can significantly affect the in-stream carbon cycle. However, how stream CO2 emissions respond to ecosystem respiration (ER) is still not well known. Here we report in-situ daily observations of headwater stream gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) and CO2 emissions conducted in five streams in two headwater catchments of the Changjiang River in Southeastern China. The results show that delta C-13(DIC), pCO(2), and CO2 emission rates have significant diel variations. Both the day and night delta C-13(DIC) values were more depleted than the theoretical values in the two catchments, but the nocturnal depletion was greater. The headwater streams have high EM, with an average ER of -1.99 +/- 0.82 g C m(-2) d(-1) and GPP of 1.52 +/- 0.84 g C m(-)(2 )d(-1) in the two catchments. ER increases with DOC concentration but decreases with water discharge.The nocturnal pCO(2) (3885 +/- 2959 mu atm) was significantly higher than in daytime (2525 +/- 2221 mu atm). The higher nocturnal CO2 emission rate (225 +/- 165 mg C m(-2 )h(-1)) was about 42 % higher than in daytime. DOC uptake velocity (V-f) was 0.46 +/- 0.14 m d(-1), and increased with lower water discharge and lower catchment-scale DOC yield. DOC loss rate (0 was 0.96 +/- 1.25 d(-1) and declined exponentially with higher water discharge and catchment-scale DOC yield. Moreover, the removal fraction of DOC via ER was about 0.32 +/- 0.14, contributing to 31 +/- 16 % of the CO2 flux in streams. The re-estimated annual CO2 flux was about 14.62 +/- 4.99 Tg C yr(-1 )from the Changjiang headwater streams network. This study emphasizes the necessity of incorporating the effects of EM into the river network's CO2 emissions and the importance of the headwater streams to river carbon cycling.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000693363200004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B108136%26rft.atitle%3DEffects%2Bof%2Bstream%2Becosystem%2Bmetabolisms%2Bon%2BCO2%2B%2528%2B%2529emissions%2Bin%2Btwo%2Bheadwater%2Bcatchments%252C%2BSoutheastern%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DChen%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DGong%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.ecolind.2021.108136%26rft.eissn%3D1872-7034%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1470-160X%26rft.jtitle%3DECOLOGICAL%2BINDICATORS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DECOL%2BINDIC%26rft.volume%3D130%26rft.au%3DGong%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DYan%252C%2BWJ%26rft.au%3DJiao%252C%2BRY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=ECOLOGICAL+INDICATORS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108136,"CO2,Ecosystem respiration,Gross primary production,Headwater streams,In-stream DOC removal efficiency,Uptake velocity","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,INORGANIC CARBON,DIOXIDE SUPERSATURATION,PARTIAL-PRESSURE,GAS-EXCHANGE,RIVER,MATTER,DYNAMICS,EMISSIONS,REMOVAL",,"Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China"
4,4,"Sousa, RGC",2018 ,Small dams for aquaculture negatively impact fish diversity in Amazonian streams,AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS,"Much has been written about the negative impacts of large hydroelectric dams on fish species diversity in the Amazon River Basin; however, less is known about the impacts of small dams in streams that are created for fish aquaculture. Our study of fish assemblages upstream and downstream of fish farm dams in Rondonia State, Brazil, revealed that the dams act as physical barriers to fish movement and that upstream assemblages showed lower measures of diversity and abundance compared to downstream. The greatest impact was the obstruction of upstream movement of a number of fish groups, coupled with isolation and disappearance of relatively rare fish species living upstream. The fish species most affected were from frugivore, herbivore and detritivore trophic levels that are associated with migration and the forming of schools (potamodromous species), although the impact was also evident in piscivorous fish commonly found in lentic habitats. Although stream dams may cause small negative effects relative to huge hydroelectric barriers, the cumulative impact of hundreds of fish farms in stream channels could be considerable. Amelioration of the damage caused by fish farm impoundments will require (1) design of effective fish passage systems around dams to reduce impact on fish diversity and (2) prohibition of the complete stream blocking to build these fish farms, which will require derivative channels to their water supply.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000426199900002,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DSmall%2Bdams%2Bfor%2Baquaculture%2Bnegatively%2Bimpact%2Bfish%2Bdiversity%2Bin%2BAmazonian%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DRaniere%2BGarcez%26rft.auinit%3DRGC%26rft.aulast%3DCosta%2BSousa%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3354%252Faei00253%26rft.eissn%3D1869-7534%26rft.epage%3D98%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1869-215X%26rft.jtitle%3DAQUACULTURE%2BENVIRONMENT%2BINTERACTIONS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D89-98%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D89%26rft.stitle%3DAQUACULT%2BENV%2BINTERAC%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DSousa%252C%2BRGC%26rft.au%3DMereles%252C%2BMD%26rft.au%3DFreitas%252C%2BCED&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=AQUACULTURE+ENVIRONMENT+INTERACTIONS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3354/aei00253,"Fish assemblages,Dams,Stream basin,Tributaries","COMMUNITIES,RIVER,ASSEMBLAGES,CONSERVATION,ECOLOGY,PASSAGE",,"Rondonia Fed Univ, Fisheries Sci Dept, BR-76916000 Presidente Medici, Rondonia, Brazil"

Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Coupling Relationship between Urbanization and Eco-Efficiency: A Case Study of Urban Agglomerations in the Yellow River Basin, China",LAND,"The coordination and coupling of new urbanization and the ecological environment is of great significance for the high-quality development of the Yellow River basin, China. In this paper, the urbanization efficiency and ecological efficiency of seven urban agglomerations in the Yellow River basin, China, from 2006 to 2019 are calculated at the city level. Spatial correlation analysis between urbanization efficiency and ecological efficiency is carried out by applying the spatial association model. Then, the spatio-temporal coupling relationship is estimated based on the relative development and spatial coupling models. The results show that urbanization efficiency has been rising, from 0.83 in 2006 to 0.91 in 2019. Ecological efficiency first stabilized and then rose from 1.03 in 2006 to 1.23 in 2019. Spatially, cities with high urbanization efficiency development are increasing from west to east. Cities with high eco-efficient developments are increasing from northwest to southeast. The coupling relationship between the two is an N-type relationship, with the trend of first rising, then falling, and then rising. Spatially, the coupling degree of the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River basin, China, is higher than that of the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin, China.

This paper proposed a theoretical framework for the relationship between water-energy-food (WEF) and poverty. An improved coupling coordination degree model and the geographical detector were used to evaluate the spatio-temporal coupling between WEF and poverty and its influencing factors in YRB. The results suggest that the levels of coupling coordination increase to different degrees in YRB and its provinces from 2000 to 2019, and the coupling types are characterized by pyramidal-shaped distribution. The regions of YRB are divided into four development types: water-driven type, energy-driven type, food-driven type, and economy-driven type.

8,8,"Vilmin, L",Jul 2016 ,Carbon fate in a large temperate human-impacted river system: Focus on benthic dynamics,GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,"Fluvial networks play an important role in regional and global carbon (C) budgets. The Seine River, from the Paris urban area to the entrance of its estuary (220km), is studied here as an example of a large human-impacted river system subject to temperate climatic conditions. We assess organic C (OC) budgets upstream and downstream from one of the world's largest wastewater treatment plants and for different hydrological conditions using a hydrobiogeochemical model. The fine representation of sediment accumulation on the river bed allows for the quantification of pelagic and benthic effects on OC export toward the estuary and on river metabolism (i.e., net CO2 production). OC export is significantly affected by benthic dynamics during the driest periods, when 25% of the inputs to the system is transformed or stored in the sediment layer. Benthic processes also substantially affect river metabolism under any hydrological condition. On average, benthic respiration accounts for one third of the total river respiration along the studied stretch (0.27 out of 0.86g C m(-2) d(-1)). Even though the importance of benthic processes was already acknowledged by the scientific community for headwater streams, these results stress the major influence of benthic dynamics, and thus of physical processes such as sedimentation and resuspension, on C cycling in downstream river systems. It opens the door to new developments in the quantification of C emissions by global models, whereby biogeochemical processing and benthic dynamics should be taken into account.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000382582400008,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DCarbon%2Bfate%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Btemperate%2Bhuman-impacted%2Briver%2Bsystem%253A%2BFocus%2Bon%2Bbenthic%2Bdynamics%26rft.aufirst%3DLauriane%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DVilmin%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015GB005271%26rft.eissn%3D1944-9224%26rft.epage%3D1104%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0886-6236%26rft.issue%3D7%26rft.jtitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEMICAL%2BCYCLES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1086-1104%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1086%26rft.stitle%3DGLOBAL%2BBIOGEOCHEM%2BCY%26rft.volume%3D30%26rft.au%3DVilmin%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DFlipo%252C%2BN%26rft.au%3DGroleau%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=GLOBAL+BIOGEOCHEMICAL+CYCLES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015GB005271,"carbon,river export and metabolism,benthic and pelagic dynamics,sediment-water exchanges,human-impacted system,hydrobiogeochemical modeling","TRACING SUSPENDED SEDIMENT,COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS,WHOLE-STREAM METABOLISM,ORGANIC-MATTER DYNAMICS,SEINE RIVER,HYPORHEIC ZONE,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,HEADWATER STREAMS,WATER-QUALITY,PHOSPHORUS",,"PSL Res Univ, Geosci Dept, MINES ParisTech, Fontainebleau, France"
9,9,"Woznicki, SA",Oct 2016 ,Large-scale climate change vulnerability assessment of stream health,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Freshwater streams are critical resources that provide multiple benefits to humans and aquatic biota alike. As climate changes, it is projected that changes to the hydrological cycle and water temperatures will affect individual biota and aquatic ecosystems as a whole. The goal of this study was to determine the extent of climate change impacts on stream ecosystems as represented by four commonly used stream health indicators (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT), Family Index of Biotic Integrity (FIBI), Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI), and fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI)). Seven watersheds in Michigan were selected based on stream thermal regimes. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to simulate streamflow and pollutant loads. Important variables for each thermal class were selected using a Bayesian variable selection method and used as inputs to adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems models of EFL FIBI, HBI, and IBI. Finally, an ensemble of climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 were used to determine the impacts of climate on the stream health in 2020-2040 compared to 1980-2000. The risk of declining stream health was determined using cumulative distribution functions. A stream temperature regression model was also developed to assess potential changes in stream thermal regimes, which could cause shifts in composition of aquatic communities. Several flow regime variables, including those related to flow variability;duration of extreme events, and timing were mainly affected by changing climate. At the watershed scale, most indicators were relatively insensitive to changing climate and the magnitude of stream health decline was low. However, at the reach scale, there are many instances of high risk and large magnitude of declines in the stream health indicators. At the same time, several streams experienced changes in thermal class, mostly transitioning from cold-transitional and cool streams to warm streams. This research demonstrated the applicability of the stream health modeling process in performing a climate change impacts assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

10,10,"Marion, A",Oct 2002 ,Effect of bed form geometry on the penetration of nonreactive solutes into a streambed,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"[1] The contamination of riverbeds by solutes derived from the surface flow has recently received increasing attention. Channel morphological features such as bed forms are important characteristics of the stream-subsurface interface and represent one control on the rate of solute delivery from the stream to the bed. Generally, larger bed forms are expected to produce greater rates of stream-subsurface exchange. However, the longitudinal dimension (wavelength) of the bed form is also important, and this effect can produce penetration patterns that may be unexpected from a visual observation of the bed surface. Experimental tests in a recirculating flume demonstrate these effects. Commonly used mathematical models do not consider the bed form geometry explicitly and depend on the availability of calibration data to derive exchange parameters for each stream reach. More detailed models that consider the effect of bed form shape are capable of simulating some of the observed experimental results. However, existing physically based models are shown to be insufficient for some bed form geometries that may occur in real streams.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000180521100027,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1209%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Bbed%2Bform%2Bgeometry%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bpenetration%2Bof%2Bnonreactive%2Bsolutes%2Binto%2Ba%2Bstreambed%26rft.aufirst%3DA%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DMarion%26rft.date%3D2002%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2001WR000264%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D10%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D38%26rft.au%3DMarion%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DBellinello%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2001WR000264,"solute transport,hyporheic,river contamination","SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,TRANSFER-FUNCTION MODEL,BENTHIC OXYGEN-UPTAKE,SEDIMENT TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,HYPORHEIC ZONE,LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS,CONVECTIVE-TRANSPORT,NONSORBING SOLUTES,COLLOID TRANSPORT",,"Univ Padua, Dept Hydraul Maritime Environm & Geotech Engn, Via Loredan 20, I-35131 Padua, Italy"
11,11,"Anthony, SE",Sep 2012 ,"Methane dynamics in the Willamette River, Oregon",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Weekly monitoring of dissolved methane (CH4) at two sites along an similar to 2-km stretch of the Willamette River (Oregon) between October 2008 and November 2010 revealed persistent supersaturation (24-170X atmospheric equilibrium). The CH4 concentration difference (Delta CH4: 0-200 nmol L-1) between the two sites varied inversely with river flow, which ranged from 125 m(3) s(-1) to 1500 m(3) s(-1) over the time series. At the downstream site, an 'excess' of <= 125% was observed, with groundwater input being the likely CH4 source. Quasi-synoptic studies of spatial trends in summer (2010, 2011) revealed steady CH4 decrease along a 12-km river stretch downstream of the time-series sites. The estimated loss due to air-water exchange for this stretch was similar to 9X greater than the perceived net loss, consistent with regionally widespread groundwater input of CH4. Bi-weekly dissolved nutrient measurements indicated that a distinct nitrate (NO3-) source also existed between the upstream and downstream time-series sites. The excesses of NO3- and CH4 were inversely correlated, with the greatest NO3- supply corresponding to periods of high rainfall in winter and highest river flow. Although groundwater input is also the probable source of NO3-, seasonal seepage of rainwater-saturated soils (shallow groundwater recharge) explains the NO3- input, while hyporheic exchange with a persistent deep aquifer best explains the CH4 input. Improved understanding of groundwater input and exchange dynamics in the Willamette River will clarify the influence of human activities on river biogeochemistry and help to better constrain the magnitude of CH4 and other greenhouse gas fluxes associated with inland waters.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000308640600021,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DMethane%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Bthe%2BWillamette%2BRiver%252C%2BOregon%26rft.aufirst%3DSara%2BE.%26rft.auinit%3DSE%26rft.aulast%3DAnthony%26rft.date%3D2012%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.4319%252Flo.2012.57.5.1517%26rft.eissn%3D1939-5590%26rft.epage%3D1530%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0024-3590%26rft.issue%3D5%26rft.jtitle%3DLIMNOLOGY%2BAND%2BOCEANOGRAPHY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1517-1530%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1517%26rft.stitle%3DLIMNOL%2BOCEANOGR%26rft.volume%3D57%26rft.au%3DAnthony%252C%2BSE%26rft.au%3DPrahl%252C%2BFG%26rft.au%3DPeterson%252C%2BTD&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=LIMNOLOGY+AND+OCEANOGRAPHY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.4319/lo.2012.57.5.1517,,"ATMOSPHERIC METHANE,CARBON-DIOXIDE,GROWTH-RATE,NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE,HYPORHEIC ZONE,STREAM,GROUNDWATER,TEMPERATE,EMISSIONS,EXCHANGE",,"Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA"
12,12,"Schubert, M",Nov 2020 ,Investigating River Water/Groundwater Interaction along a Rivulet Section by Rn-222 Mass Balancing,WATER,"Investigation of river water/groundwater interaction aims generally at: (i) localizing water migration pathways; and (ii) quantifying water and associated matter exchange between the two natural water resources. Related numerical models generally rely on model-specific parameters that represent the physical conditions of the catchment and suitable aqueous tracer data. A generally applicable approach for this purpose is based on the finite element model FINIFLUX that is using the radioactive noble gas radon-222 as naturally occurring tracer. During the study discussed in this paper, radon and physical stream data were used with the aim to localize and quantify groundwater discharge into a well-defined section of a small headwater stream. Besides site-specific results of two sampling campaigns, the outcomes of the study reveal: (i) the general difficulties of conducting river water/groundwater interaction studies in small and heterogeneous headwater catchments; and (ii) the particular challenge of defining well constrained site- and campaign-specific values for both the groundwater radon endmember and the radon degassing coefficient. It was revealed that determination of both parameters should be based on as many data sources as possible and include a critical assessment of the reasonability of the gathered and used datasets. The results of our study exposed potential limitations of the approach if executed in small and turbulent headwater streams. Hence, we want to emphasize that the project was not only executed as a case study at a distinct site but rather aimed at evaluating the applicability of the chosen approach for conducting river water/groundwater interaction studies in heterogeneous headwater catchments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000594927600001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B3027%26rft.atitle%3DInvestigating%2BRiver%2BWater%252FGroundwater%2BInteraction%2Balong%2Ba%2BRivulet%2BSection%2Bby%2BRn-222%2BMass%2BBalancing%26rft.aufirst%3DMichael%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DSchubert%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw12113027%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D12%26rft.au%3DSchubert%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DKnoeller%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DGilfedder%252C%2BB&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w12113027,"river water,groundwater interaction,tracer,radon mass balance,FINIFLUX","SURFACE-WATER INTERACTIONS,GROUNDWATER INFLOWS,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,TRACER,AUSTRALIA,STREAMS,FLUXES,RADON,RATES,STATE",,"UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany"

14,14,"Fricke, AT",Jan 2019 ,Morphology and dynamics of the intertidal floodplain along the Amazon tidal river,EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS,"Depositional environments along the tidal river downstream of & Oacute; bidos have been proposed as important sinks for up to one third of the sediment discharge from the Amazon River. However, the morphology of the intertidal floodplain and the dynamics of sediment exchange along this reach have yet to be described. River-bank surveys in five regions along the Amazon tidal river reveal a distinct transition in bank morphology between the upper, central and lower reaches of the tidal river. The upper tidal-river floodplain is defined by prominent natural levees that control the transfer of water and sediment between the mainstem Amazon River and its floodplain. Greater tidal influence in the central tidal river suppresses levee development, and tidal currents increase sediment transport into the distal parts of the floodplain. In the lower tidal river, the floodplain morphology closely resembles marine intertidal environments (e.g. mud flats, salt marshes), with dendritic tidal channels incising elevated vegetated flats. Theory, morphology and geochronology suggest that the dynamics of sediment delivery to the intertidal floodplain of the Amazon tidal river vary along its length due to the relative influence and coupling of fluvial and tidal dynamics.

15,15,"Claessens, L",Apr 2010 ,Longitudinal assessment of the effect of concentration on stream N uptake rates in an urbanizing watershed,BIOGEOCHEMISTRY,"We examined the effect of concentration on nitrogen uptake patterns for a suburban stream in Maryland and addressed the question: How does NO3 (-) uptake change as a function of concentration and how do uptake patterns compare with those found for NH4 (+)? We applied a longitudinal (stream channel corridor) approach in a forested stream section and conducted short-term nutrient addition experiments in late summer 2004. In the downstream direction, NO3 (-) concentrations decreased because of residential development in headwaters and downstream dilution; NH4 (+) concentrations slightly increased. The uptake patterns for NO3 (-) were very different from NH4 (+). While NH4 (+) had a typical negative relationship between first-order uptake rate constant (K (c) ) and stream size, NO3 (-) had a reverse pattern. We found differences for other metrics, including uptake velocity (V (f) ) and areal uptake rate (U). We attributed these differences to a stream size effect, a concentration effect and a biological uptake capacity effect. For NO3 (-) these combined effects produced a downstream increase in K (c) , V (f) and U; for NH4 (+) they produced a downstream decrease in K (c) and V (f) , and a not well defined pattern for U. We attributed a downstream increase in NO3 (-) uptake capacity to an increase in hyporheic exchange and a likely increase in carbon availability. We also found that K (c) and V (f) were indirectly related with concentration. Similar evidence of 'nutrient saturation' has been reported in other recent studies. Our results suggest that higher-order uptake models might be warranted when scaling NO3 (-) uptake across watersheds that are subject to increased nitrogen loading.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000276605000005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLongitudinal%2Bassessment%2Bof%2Bthe%2Beffect%2Bof%2Bconcentration%2Bon%2Bstream%2BN%2Buptake%2Brates%2Bin%2Ban%2Burbanizing%2Bwatershed%26rft.aufirst%3DLuc%26rft.auinit%3DL%26rft.aulast%3DClaessens%26rft.date%3D2010%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs10533-009-9376-y%26rft.eissn%3D1573-515X%26rft.epage%3D74%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0168-2563%26rft.issue%3D1-3%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D63-74%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D63%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOCHEMISTRY%26rft.volume%3D98%26rft.au%3DClaessens%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DTague%252C%2BCL%26rft.au%3DMelack%252C%2BJM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOCHEMISTRY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s10533-009-9376-y,"Nitrogen,Nutrient additions,Nutrient saturation,Streams","TRANSIENT STORAGE,NITROGEN,RETENTION,SIZE",,"Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA"

Under the new requirements of realizing ecological protection and high-quality development of the YRB, the coordinated development of basin economic development and ecological environment is an urgent research topic. Taking 36 cities along the Yellow River Basin as samples, this paper constructs an evaluation index system of economic development and ecological environment. The coupling coordination model and geographical weighted regression were adopted to analyze the coupling coordination relationship between economic development and ecological environment from 2008 to 2017, and the influencing factors were analyzed. The results showed that (1) the coupling coordination of urban economic development and ecological environment along the YRB showed significant regional heterogeneity, forming a low-value sag of the Loess Plateau; (2) the regional hot spots in the downstream of the YRB continuously extended inland, while these in the midstream converged; (3) the coupling coordination degree between economic development and ecological environment is affected by factors such as population size, openness, and advanced industrial structure, and the intensity varies significantly among regions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000574802300015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DStudy%2Bon%2Bcoupling%2Bcoordination%2Band%2Bspatiotemporal%2Bheterogeneity%2Bbetween%2Beconomic%2Bdevelopment%2Band%2Becological%2Benvironment%2Bof%2Bcities%2Balong%2Bthe%2BYellow%2BRiver%2BBasin%26rft.aufirst%3DKe%26rft.auinit%3DK%26rft.aulast%3DLiu%26rft.date%3D2021%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs11356-020-11051-0%26rft.eissn%3D1614-7499%26rft.epage%3D6912%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0944-1344%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BPOLLUTION%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D6898-6912%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D6898%26rft.stitle%3DENVIRON%2BSCI%2BPOLLUT%2BR%26rft.volume%3D28%26rft.au%3DLiu%252C%2BK%26rft.au%3DQiao%252C%2BYR%26rft.au%3DZhou%252C%2BQ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE+AND+POLLUTION+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s11356-020-11051-0,"Economic development,Ecological environment,Coupling coordination,Geographical weighted regression (GWR),The Yellow River Basin (YRB)","RESOURCE-ENVIRONMENT,ENERGY-CONSUMPTION,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,CO2 EMISSIONS,CHINA,GROWTH,URBANIZATION,SYSTEM,INDICATORS,POLLUTION",,"Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Econ Coll, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China"

18,18,"Grant, SB",Nov 2020 ,Unifying Advective and Diffusive Descriptions of Bedform Pumping in the Benthic Biolayer of Streams,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Many water quality and ecosystem functions performed by streams occur in the benthic biolayer, the biologically active upper (similar to 5 cm) layer of the streambed. Solute transport through the benthic biolayer is facilitated by bedform pumping, a physical process in which dynamic and static pressure variations over the surface of stationary bedforms (e.g., ripples and dunes) drive flow across the sediment-water interface. In this paper we derive two predictive modeling frameworks, one advective and the other diffusive, for solute transport through the benthic biolayer by bedform pumping. Both frameworks closely reproduce patterns and rates of bedform pumping previously measured in the laboratory, provided that the diffusion model's dispersion coefficient declines exponentially with depth. They are also functionally equivalent, such that parameter sets inferred from the 2D advective model can be applied to the 1D diffusive model, and vice versa. The functional equivalence and complementary strengths of these two models expand the range of questions that can be answered, for example, by adopting the 2D advective model to study the effects of geomorphic processes (such as bedform adjustments to land use change) on flow-dependent processes and the 1D diffusive model to study problems where multiple transport mechanisms combine (such as bedform pumping and turbulent diffusion). By unifying 2D advective and 1D diffusive descriptions of bedform pumping, our analytical results provide a straightforward and computationally efficient approach for predicting, and better understanding, solute transport in the benthic biolayer of streams and coastal sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000595832300044,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2Be2020WR027967%26rft.atitle%3DUnifying%2BAdvective%2Band%2BDiffusive%2BDescriptions%2Bof%2BBedform%2BPumping%2Bin%2Bthe%2BBenthic%2BBiolayer%2Bof%2BStreams%26rft.aufirst%3DStanley%2BB.%26rft.auinit%3DSB%26rft.aulast%3DGrant%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2020WR027967%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.issue%3D11%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D56%26rft.au%3DGrant%252C%2BSB%26rft.au%3DMonofy%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DGhisalberti%252C%2BM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2020WR027967,"water quality,hyporheic exchange,bedform pumping,benthic biolayer,sediments,surface water groundwater exchange","HYPORHEIC-EXCHANGE,RESIDENCE TIME,NONSORBING SOLUTES,TRANSPORT,FLOW,WATER,DENITRIFICATION,MODEL,ZONE,TURBULENCE",,"Virginia Tech, Charles E Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Occoquan Watershed Monitoring Lab, Manassas, VA 20110 USA"
19,19,"Moon, YS",Jul 2009 ,Efficient stream subsequence matching algorithms for handheld devices on streaming time-series data,COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,"In recent years, the real-time processing of infinite online stream data is becoming a hot research issue. For the handheld devices dealing with the stream data, minimizing repetitive CPU operations such as multiplications is a major factor for their performances. In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for finding similar subsequences from streaming time-series data such as stock prices, network traffic data, exchange rates, and sensor network data. First, we formally define the problem of similar subsequence matching from streaming time-series data, which is called the stream subsequence matching in this paper. Second, based on the window construction mechanism adopted by the previous subsequence matching algorithms in the non-streaming environment, we present an efficient window-based approach that minimizes CPU operations required for stream subsequence matching. Third, to make sure the window-based approach to be practical, we propose a notion of window MBR and present two stream subsequence matching algorithms based on the notion. Fourth, we formally prove correctness of the proposed algorithms. Finally, through a series of analyses and experiments, we show that our algorithms significantly outperform the naive algorithm. To our knowledge, there has been no algorithm to efficiently handle the stream subsequence matching problem except the naive one. Analysis results show that the numbers of multiplications of our algorithms are reduced by the factor of several hundreds than the naive one. Experiment results of measuring the elapsed execution times show that the performances of our algorithms are improved by up to several tens of times over the naive one. We believe that our window-based algorithms are excellent choices for embedded stream subsequence matching in handheld devices.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000277952200005,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEfficient%2Bstream%2Bsubsequence%2Bmatching%2Balgorithms%2Bfor%2Bhandheld%2Bdevices%2Bon%2Bstreaming%2Btime-series%2Bdata%26rft.aufirst%3DYang-Sae%26rft.auinit%3DYS%26rft.aulast%3DMoon%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft.epage%3D284%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0267-6192%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DCOMPUTER%2BSYSTEMS%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D273-284%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D273%26rft.stitle%3DCOMPUT%2BSYST%2BSCI%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DMoon%252C%2BYS%26rft.au%3DLoh%252C%2BWK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=COMPUTER+SYSTEMS+SCIENCE+AND+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"streaming time-series data,stream subsequence matching,similar subsequence matching,handheld devices",SIMILARITY SEARCH,,"Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 192-1 Hyoja Dong, Chunchon 200701, Kangwon Do, South Korea"
20,20,"Goncalves-Silva, M",Aug 31 2022 ,Effect of drying dynamics on the functional structure of a fish assemblage from an intermittent river network,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"We are living in a fast-changing world promoted by anthropogenic actions and ecosystems' functioning has been constantly changed. One example is the globally reduction of river flow that can lead to more than 50% of the rivers and streams around the world becoming intermittent. However, the relationship between environmental changes and biological communities has been limited to taxonomic approach, rather than the functional approach. Functional structure determines how individuals interact with the environment and evaluating the effects of hydrological changes in functional variation can elucidate the responses of aquatic biota under climate changes. Thus, we hypothesized that hydrological phases (dry, re-wetting and wet) would influence both environmental conditions and fish composition (i.e., taxonomic richness and functional structure) in one intermittent river. In addition, we expected that: 1) fish assemblages will have higher values of species richness and Functional Diversity indexes-Richness (FRic), Dispersion (FDis), Specialization (FSpe), and Originality (FOri) in drier phases (dry and re-wetting); and 2) higher values of Functional Diversity indexes related to evenness (FEve) and divergence (FDiv) in the wet phase, due to the predominance of species with high dispersal capacity when sites are connected. Sampling was conducted in the Cruxati river during the three hydrological phases along four sites (250 m each). Functional diversity analysis, involving traits of dispersion, life history and trophic ecology were used to apply Functional Diversity indexes. Indexes were compared from null models and all species were ordered in a multidimensional functional space using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). In the dry phase, taxonomic richness and FRic between communities is higher, as well as FSpe and FOri, showing that each assemblage has unique characteristics with different strategies allowing the establishment in this hydrological phase. However, communities are less functionally dispersed. In the wet phase, when the river is connected, FDis between communities is higher and species abundances are more equitable with regular distribution in the functional space. Therefore, we conclude that local ecological processes (i.e., dynamics of hydrology) may promote the establishment of species according to their functional traits and thereby the functional structure of local assemblages.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000891291900001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B903974%26rft.atitle%3DEffect%2Bof%2Bdrying%2Bdynamics%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bfunctional%2Bstructure%2Bof%2Ba%2Bfish%2Bassemblage%2Bfrom%2Ban%2Bintermittent%2Briver%2Bnetwork%26rft.aufirst%3DMilena%26rft.auinit%3DM%26rft.aulast%3DGoncalves-Silva%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3389%252Ffenvs.2022.903974%26rft.eissn%3D2296-665X%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.jtitle%3DFRONTIERS%2BIN%2BENVIRONMENTAL%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DFRONT%2BENV%2BSCI-SWITZ%26rft.volume%3D10%26rft.au%3DGoncalves-Silva%252C%2BM%26rft.au%3DManna%252C%2BLR%26rft.au%3DRezende%252C%2BCF&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=FRONTIERS+IN+ENVIRONMENTAL+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3389/fenvs.2022.903974,"functional diversity,climate changes,temporary streams,drying rivers networks,semiarid climate","FRESH-WATER FISH,DIVERSITY,STREAM,DROUGHT,COMMUNITY,RESPONSES,FLOW,DIVERSIFICATION,FRAMEWORK,HABITAT",,"Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ecol, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Inst Biol Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil"

Of the major sources of suspended sediment inputs into the Richmond River estuary, fluvial input from the upper catchment area was about 92-99% of the total yearly balance, and more than 90% of this fluvial sediment was transported into the estuary during less than 5% time of the year. The Richmond River estuary received net sediment input of about 1-2% of the total yearly balance from the continental shelf during dry seasons when upper catchment freshwater input was less than 45 x 10(6) m(3). Bank erosion in the Richmond River estuary was least (<1%) during low to moderate floods mainly due to river training works and large mangrove coverage along the banks. Percentage of sediment export from the Richmond River estuary depends on the magnitude of floods, which was evident from 47% export during dry year when the estuary experienced a minor flood compared to 88% export during the wet year when the estuary experienced one minor and one moderate flood.

Groundwater from these aquifers Usually has an important influence on the hydrology, hydrochemistry and ecology of upland river systems. Tracer-based research in the Girnock burn catchment in the Cairngorms revealed that groundwater comprises at least 30% of annual runoff. Groundwater often enters stream channels via drift deposits in valley bottom areas, which appear to be fed from recharge areas on the catchment interfluves. A range of groundwater sources exist in the catchment reflecting the complex solid and drift geology. These account for spatial differences in stream hydrochemistry and the spatial delineation of groundwater discharges to rivers and riparian zones. Areas where groundwaters enter the stream channel directly can have profound ecological implications. Most obvious are low rates of salmonid egg survival where chemically reduced groundwater discharges through the hyporheic zone. However, it is argued that only further research will reveal the full significance of groundwater-surface water interactions to the ecological status of Scottish rivers.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000229177200006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DGroundwater-surface%2Bwater%2Binteractions%2Bin%2Bupland%2BScottish%2Brivers%253A%2Bhydrological%252C%2Bhydrochemical%2Band%2Becological%2Bimplications%26rft.aufirst%3DC%26rft.auinit%3DC%26rft.aulast%3DSoulsby%26rft.date%3D2005%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1144%252Fsjg41010039%26rft.epage%3D49%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0036-9276%26rft.jtitle%3DSCOTTISH%2BJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D39-49%26rft.part%3D1%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D39%26rft.stitle%3DSCOT%2BJ%2BGEOL%26rft.volume%3D41%26rft.au%3DSoulsby%252C%2BC%26rft.au%3DMalcolm%252C%2BIA%26rft.au%3DHannah%252C%2BDM&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=SCOTTISH+JOURNAL+OF+GEOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1144/sjg41010039,,"SPAWNING ATLANTIC SALMON,DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES,HYPORHEIC ZONE,CAIRNGORM MOUNTAINS,STREAM,CATCHMENT,SCOTLAND,TRACER,CHEMISTRY,EXCHANGE",,"Univ Aberdeen, Dept Geog & Environm, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland"
23,23,"Campeau, A",Apr 2014 ,Patterns in CH4 and CO2 concentrations across boreal rivers: Major drivers and implications for fluvial greenhouse emissions under climate change scenarios,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"It is now widely accepted that boreal rivers and streams are regionally significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), yet their role as methane (CH4) emitters, as well as the sensitivity of these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to climate change, are still largely undefined. In this study, we explore the large-scale patterns of fluvial CO2 and CH4 partial pressure (pCO(2),pCH(4)) and gas exchange (k) relative to a set of key, climate-sensitive river variables across 46 streams and rivers in two distinct boreal landscapes of Northern Quebec. We use the resulting models to determine the direction and magnitude of C-gas emissions from these boreal fluvial networks under scenarios of climate change. River pCO(2) and pCH(4) were positively correlated, although the latter was two orders of magnitude more variable. We provide evidence that in-stream metabolism strongly influences the dynamics of surface water pCO(2) and pCH(4), but whereas pCO(2) is not influenced by temperature in the surveyed streams and rivers, pCH(4) appears to be strongly temperature-dependent. The major predictors of ambient gas concentrations and exchange were water temperature, velocity, and DOC, and the resulting models indicate that total GHG emissions (C-CO2 equivalent) from the entire network may increase between by 13 to 68% under plausible scenarios of climate change over the next 50years. These predicted increases in fluvial GHG emissions are mostly driven by a steep increase in the contribution of CH4 (from 36 to over 50% of total CO2-equivalents). The current role of boreal fluvial networks as major landscape sources of C is thus likely to expand, mainly driven by large increases in fluvial CH4 emissions.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000332069500006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DPatterns%2Bin%2BCH4%2Band%2BCO2%2Bconcentrations%2Bacross%2Bboreal%2Brivers%253A%2BMajor%2Bdrivers%2Band%2Bimplications%2Bfor%2Bfluvial%2Bgreenhouse%2Bemissions%2Bunder%2Bclimate%2Bchange%2Bscenarios%26rft.aufirst%3DAudrey%26rft.auinit%3DA%26rft.aulast%3DCampeau%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1111%252Fgcb.12479%26rft.eissn%3D1365-2486%26rft.epage%3D1088%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1354-1013%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DGLOBAL%2BCHANGE%2BBIOLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1075-1088%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1075%26rft.stitle%3DGLOBAL%2BCHANGE%2BBIOL%26rft.volume%3D20%26rft.au%3DCampeau%252C%2BA%26rft.au%3DDel%2BGiorgio%252C%2BPA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=GLOBAL+CHANGE+BIOLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1111/gcb.12479,"carbon dioxide (CO2),climate change,greenhouse gases (GHG),methane (CH4),rivers stream and fluvial networks","DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON,WATER METHANE EMISSIONS,GAS FLUXES,TEMPERATURE,DIOXIDE,LAKES,SENSITIVITY,CATCHMENT,FOREST,SUPERSATURATION",,"Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci Air Water & Landscape Sci, Villavagen 16, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden"

25,25,"Mbaka, JG",Jun 2016 ,Effect of Small Impoundments on Leaf Litter Decomposition in Streams,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Leaf litter decomposition is an important process providing energy to freshwater biota. Flow regulation and dams can strongly alter freshwater ecosystems, but little is known about the effect of small impoundments on leaf litter decomposition rates in headwater streams. In this study, we examined the effect of small water storage impoundments (80 to 720m(3)) on leaf litter decomposition by comparing sites located within 10-m upstream and downstream of nine impoundments (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany) and sites located further upstream and downstream. The impoundments did not have a statistically significant effect on most physico-chemical variables. However, the abundance of shredders and leaf litter decomposition rates decreased in study sites located within 10-m upstream of the area flooded by impoundments. Small impoundments can locally reduce leaf litter decomposition rates in headwater streams. The effect of small impoundments on ecosystem functioning is minor and may require less attention by freshwater managers than other stressors, though this may differ for other ecological aspects such as connectivity.

26,26,"Chen, XB",Apr 2020 ,Assessing connectivity between the river channel and floodplains during high flows using hydrodynamic modeling and particle tracking analysis,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"River-floodplain connectivity is vital to hydrological and biogeochemical processes in river corridors over multiple spatiotemporal scales. In the present study, an approach of particle tracking in conjunction with two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling was developed to study the dynamics of river-floodplain connectivity during flood periods and applied to the study of McCarran Ranch in the lower Truckee River, Nevada, U.S. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated for flood events of different magnitudes of peak flow discharge. The outputs of the hydrodynamic model were further applied to determine the lateral transboundary flux during high flows. Lagrangian particle trajectories were then performed to quantify the flow path length and residence time on floodplains. The exchange frequency between the river mainstem and the floodplain were also examined.The results show that the hydrodynamic model reproduce hydrographs well. The river-floodplain exchange is sensitive to the magnitudes of the flood events. Larger floods cause shorter residence times and flow path lengths on the floodplains but lead to larger transboundary flux within the river reaches. The particle analysis results also show that higher discharge introduces less frequent exchange between the river channel and floodplains. Furthermore, comparison of the river-floodplain exchange properties among river reaches with different levels of sinuosity show that meandering reaches can introduce considerably higher exchange flux than a straight reach, leading to complex exchange behaviors within the river-floodplain system.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000527388300006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B124609%26rft.atitle%3DAssessing%2Bconnectivity%2Bbetween%2Bthe%2Briver%2Bchannel%2Band%2Bfloodplains%2Bduring%2Bhigh%2Bflows%2Busing%2Bhydrodynamic%2Bmodeling%2Band%2Bparticle%2Btracking%2Banalysis%26rft.aufirst%3DXiaobing%26rft.auinit%3DXB%26rft.aulast%3DChen%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1016%252Fj.jhydrol.2020.124609%26rft.eissn%3D1879-2707%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0022-1694%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BHYDROLOGY%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BHYDROL%26rft.volume%3D583%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BXB%26rft.au%3DChen%252C%2BL%26rft.au%3DAcharya%252C%2BK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+HYDROLOGY&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124609,"River-floodplain connectivity,Hydrodynamic modeling,Particle tracking,Floods,Exchange flux","SHALLOW-WATER EQUATIONS,MAIN CHANNEL,HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY,LAGRANGIAN CIRCULATION,MEANDERING RIVER,FLOOD-PLAIN,INUNDATION,EXCHANGE,PATTERNS,AREA",,"Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China"

The erosion-deposition characteristics of the channel have close relation with the variation of size compositions of both suspended-load and bed material. These aims are addressed by deducing the sediment exchange equations from the mass conservation perspective and establishing a river-sediment mathematical model based on the theory. The model is applied in the middle and lower Yellow River, China, and calibrated and verified under both deposition and erosion conditions using a generalized channel and a large quantity of measured data in the Yellow River basin. The results indicate that the grading curves of suspended-load and bed material calculated by the mathematical model are close to those of the measured data. The temporal and spatial variations in the mean sizes of suspended-load and bed material, flow rate, sediment concentration and erosion or deposition volume estimates during the entire flood process can be accurately predicted. The model performance is considered acceptable for determining the sediment exchange process and the change in channel morphology for unsteady sediment-laden flow.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000484561500018,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2B1543%26rft.atitle%3DModelling%2Bof%2BSediment%2BExchange%2Bbetween%2BSuspended-Load%2Band%2BBed%2BMaterial%2Bin%2Bthe%2BMiddle%2Band%2BLower%2BYellow%2BRiver%252C%2BChina%26rft.aufirst%3DLianjun%26rft.auinit%3DLJ%26rft.aulast%3DZhao%26rft.date%3D2019%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.3390%252Fw11081543%26rft.eissn%3D2073-4441%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issue%3D8%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER-SUI%26rft.volume%3D11%26rft.au%3DZhao%252C%2BLJ%26rft.au%3DJiang%252C%2BEH%26rft.au%3DZhang%252C%2BWJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=WATER&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.3390/w11081543,"suspended-load,bed material,size gradation,sediment exchange,mathematical model","NUMERICAL-SIMULATION,TRANSPORT,FLOW,PARAMETERS,DEPOSITION,DISCHARGE,REACH",,"Yellow River Conservancy Commiss, Yellow River Inst Hydraul Res, Key Lab Yellow River Sediment Res, Zhengzhou 450003, Henan, Peoples R China"
28,28,"Drummond, JD",Dec 2016 ,Linking in-stream nutrient uptake to hydrologic retention in two headwater streams,FRESHWATER SCIENCE,"Stream hydraulics control flux into and out of slow-moving water transient storage (WTS) zones and, thus, hydrologic retention in stream channels. In-stream nutrient uptake is thought to depend on hydrologic retention, so stream hydraulics could influence the extent to which in-stream nutrient biogeochemistry affects nutrient export downstream. Our goals were to: 1) characterize WTS with an emphasis on water residence time and 2) evaluate its influence on nutrient uptake. We analyzed data from 2 y of monthly solute-tracer injections with accompanying nutrient-uptake estimates in 2 hydrogeomorphically different streams. We fit the conservative tracer breakthrough curves to 2 hydrodynamic models: the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) and the stochastic mobile-immobile model (SMIM), which allows for a wide distribution of water residence times. The 2 streams differed hydraulically, especially in water residence-time distributions in WTS zones. SMIM parameters depended less on discharge than did OTIS parameters, indicating that SMIM may be influenced more by local features of channel morphology than by hydrologic conditions. NH4+ uptake differed between streams, was correlated with all SMIM hydraulic parameters, and was weakly correlated with only 1 OTIS parameter. Based on SMIM correlations, the parameters related to the exchange of free-flowing water with water storage zones and the in-stream retention times explained 43 and 41%, respectively, of the variation in NH4+ uptake in the streams. Soluble reactive P (SRP) uptake was similar between streams and was not correlated with hydraulic parameters. These results indicate that hydraulics and residence time of water can be important regulators of WTS zones and nutrient uptake in headwater streams, but other environmental factors must be considered for complete understanding of in-stream nutrient processing capacity.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000388080700010,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DLinking%2Bin-stream%2Bnutrient%2Buptake%2Bto%2Bhydrologic%2Bretention%2Bin%2Btwo%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DJennifer%2BD.%26rft.auinit%3DJD%26rft.aulast%3DDrummond%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1086%252F688599%26rft.eissn%3D2161-9565%26rft.epage%3D1188%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2161-9549%26rft.issue%3D4%26rft.jtitle%3DFRESHWATER%2BSCIENCE%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1176-1188%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1176%26rft.stitle%3DFRESHW%2BSCI%26rft.volume%3D35%26rft.au%3DDrummond%252C%2BJD%26rft.au%3DBernal%252C%2BS%26rft.au%3DMarti%252C%2BE&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=FRESHWATER+SCIENCE&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1086/688599,"stream,nitrogen,phosphorus,uptake,retention,hydraulics,transient storage,model,OTIS,SMIM","TRANSIENT STORAGE,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,MOUNTAIN STREAM,PHOSPHORUS,NITROGEN,CHANNEL,DYNAMICS,BEHAVIOR,CARBON,ZONE",,"Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB CSIC, Integrat Freshwater Ecol Grp, C Acces Cala St Francesc 17, Blanes 17300, Girona, Spain"
29,29,"Pilechi, A",Jun 2016 ,Efficient Method for Coupling Field Data and Numerical Modeling for the Estimation of Transverse Mixing Coefficients in Meandering Rivers,JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING,"A numerical model has been developed employing an orthogonal stream-tube gridding system for the investigation of mixing patterns in meandering rivers. The proposed model couples field data and modeling. It uses a measured velocity field to solve the advection-diffusion equation. This equation provides a practical simulation with greater accuracy and lower computational cost for estimation of mixing in meandering channels with a long, full mixing length. The model has been used to estimate the transverse mixing coefficient in surveyed subreaches of the North Saskatchewan River in Canada. Good agreement was observed between the numerical and measured tracer concentrations using reasonable values for the transverse mixing coefficient. The average dimensionless transverse mixing coefficient from the calibrated numerical model for the surveyed reach was 0.39, which was consistent with values estimated using empirical formulas for transverse mixing coefficients in natural meandering rivers. The estimated transverse mixing coefficient was more than an order of magnitude higher in a subreach with a sharp bend than in other subreaches. For comparison, the transverse mixing coefficient was also calculated analytically from standard and general methods of moments between some sections.

In the study, the main components of the video stream acquisition/transmission latency are given, the degree of their contribution to the total latency was analyzed, the assessment on the potential ability to influence them when developing a real-time video stream acquisition/transmission systems was given. The issues connected with using the frame buffering in such systems are designated, primarily the impact on the total latency value when having a framebuffer in such a system. The limitations of the existing MIPI module implementations of some ARM microprocessors resulting in latency increase for MIPI CSI camera video stream acquisition were characterized.The structural and functional organization based on the use of digital streaming buses, fragmentation of video frames and DMA transactions for MIPI CSI video stream acquisition systems was proposed, which does not require the use of framebuffers and, as a result, provides the possibility of reducing the overall video stream acquisition latency. The proposed structural and functional organization could be implemented based on SoC-FPGA solutions, including the use of the existing IP-cores. Pragmatic peculiar features were described and the corresponding expression for estimating the limiting value of the latency for the proposed structural and functional organization was given.For experimental verification, a prototype of the video stream acquisition/transmission system, based on the Zynq-7000 SoC-FPGA family of Xilinx following the proposed structural and functional organization was created. Its specifics and corresponding features of its implementation were discussed in the paper. The performance of the obtained prototype was estimated, and the possible directions towards further reduction of the overall latency of video stream acquisition/transmission were considered.The results of the study may prove useful to reduce the latencies of the video streams acquired from MIPI CSI cameras in real-time video stream transmission systems based on SoC-FPGA.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000583845800004,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DAccelerated%2BMIPI%2BCSI%2Bvideo%2Bstream%2Bacquision%2Bin%2Btasks%2Bof%2Breal-time%2Bvideo%2Bstreaming%26rft.aufirst%3DT.%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DTA%26rft.aulast%3DKhodniev%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.20535%252FRADAP.2020.82.35-43%26rft.epage%3D43%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2310-0389%26rft.issue%3D82%26rft.jtitle%3DVISNYK%2BNTUU%2BKPI%2BSERIIA-RADIOTEKHNIKA%2BRADIOAPARATOBUDUVANNIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D35-43%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D35%26rft.stitle%3DVISNYK%2BNTUU%2BKPI%2BSER-%26rft.au%3DKhodniev%252C%2BTA%26rft.au%3DHolub%252C%2BMS%26rft.au%3DVarfolomieiev%252C%2BAY&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=VISNYK+NTUU+KPI+SERIIA-RADIOTEKHNIKA+RADIOAPARATOBUDUVANNIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.20535/RADAP.2020.82.35-43,"SoC,FPGA,MIPI CSI,GigE Vision,video,streaming",,,

We present a new statistical method for mapping genetic differences among populations of freshwater fish to the sections of streams that connect them. The method is useful for freshwater species that can only disperse through stream corridors and for other species that live in habitats for which there is one, and only one, corridor connecting each pair of populations ( e. g., alpine organisms confined to ridge tops). The model is a simple extension of the least-squares method for constructing evolutionary trees. In this model, the genetic distances between populations are modeled as a sum of genetic distances mapped onto landscape features ( e. g., stream sections). Analysis of simulated data shows that the method produces useful results with realistic amounts of data. The model was fit to empirical microsatellite data from four metapopulations of freshwater fish and showed an excellent fit in three out of four cases.

33,33,"Stegen, JC",Jul 1 2022 ,Organic matter transformations are disconnected between surface water and the hyporheic zone,BIOGEOSCIENCES,"Biochemical transformations of organic matter (OM) are a primary driver of river corridor biogeochemistry, thereby modulating ecosystem processes at local to global scales. OM transformations are driven by diverse biotic and abiotic processes, but we lack knowledge of how the diversity of those processes varies across river corridors and across surface and subsurface components of river corridors. To fill this gap we quantified the number of putative biotic and abiotic transformations of organic molecules across diverse river corridors using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry. The number of unique transformations is used here as a proxy for the diversity of biochemical processes underlying observed profiles of organic molecules. For this, we use public data spanning the contiguous United States (ConUS) from the Worldwide Hydrobiogeochemical Observation Network for Dynamic River Systems (WHONDRS) consortium. Our results show that surface water OM had more biotic and abiotic transformations than OM from shallow hyporheic zone sediments (1-3 cm depth). We observed substantially more biotic than abiotic transformations, and the numbers of biotic and abiotic transformations were highly correlated with each other. We found no relationship between the number of transformations in surface water and sediments and no meaningful relationships with latitude, longitude, or climate. We also found that the composition of transformations in sediments was not linked with transformation composition in adjacent surface waters. We infer that OM transformations represented in surface water are an integrated signal of diverse processes occurring throughout the upstream catchment. In contrast, OM transformations in sediments likely reflect a narrower range of processes within the sampled volume. This indicates decoupling between the processes influencing surface water and sediment OM, despite the potential for hydrologic exchange to homogenize OM. We infer that the processes influencing OM transformations and the scales at which they operate diverge between surface water and sediments.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000819420500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DOrganic%2Bmatter%2Btransformations%2Bare%2Bdisconnected%2Bbetween%2Bsurface%2Bwater%2Band%2Bthe%2Bhyporheic%2Bzone%26rft.aufirst%3DJames%2BC.%26rft.auinit%3DJC%26rft.aulast%3DStegen%26rft.date%3D2022%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.5194%252Fbg-19-3099-2022%26rft.eissn%3D1726-4189%26rft.epage%3D3110%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D1726-4170%26rft.issue%3D12%26rft.jtitle%3DBIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D3099-3110%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D3099%26rft.stitle%3DBIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft.volume%3D19%26rft.au%3DStegen%252C%2BJC%26rft.au%3DFansler%252C%2BSJ%26rft.au%3DToyoda%252C%2BJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.5194/bg-19-3099-2022,,"RESONANCE MASS-SPECTROMETRY,CARBON-CYCLE,ENERGY-FLOW,RIVER,TERRESTRIAL,AMAZON,RESPIRATION,HEADWATERS,TRANSPORT,OCEANS",,"Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Earth & Biol Sci Directorate, Richland, WA 99352 USA"

To determine the relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quantity and nitrate (NO3-) uptake kinetics in streams, we performed a series of NO3- Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization experiments in four streams within the Lamprey River Watershed, New Hampshire, across a range in background DOC concentrations (1-8mgC/L). Experiments were performed throughout the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. Across streams and experimental dates, ambient uptake velocity (V-f) correlated positively with increasing DOC concentrations and DOC:NO3- ratios but was only weakly negatively associated with NO3- concentrations. Ambient NO3-Vf was unrelated to pH, light, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance at 254nm. Although there were general tendencies across the entire Lamprey River Watershed, individual sites behaved differently in their uptake kinetics. NO3- uptake dynamics in the Lamprey River Watershed are most strongly influenced by DOC concentrations rather than NO3- concentrations or physicochemical parameters, which have been identified as regional- to continental-scale drivers in previous research. Understanding the fundamental relationships between dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients will be important as global and climatic changes influence the delivery and production of DOC and NO3- in aquatic ecosystems.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000370173100013,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DDOC%253ANO3-%2Bratios%2Band%2BNO3-%2Buptake%2Bin%2Bforested%2Bheadwater%2Bstreams%26rft.aufirst%3DBianca%26rft.auinit%3DB%26rft.aulast%3DRodriguez-Cardona%26rft.date%3D2016%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015JG003146%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D217%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D205-217%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D205%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D121%26rft.au%3DRodriguez-Cardona%252C%2BB%26rft.au%3DWymore%252C%2BAS%26rft.au%3DMcDowell%252C%2BWH&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015JG003146,"nitrate,uptake velocity,DOC,streams,TASCC,DOC:NO3 ratio","NUTRIENT-UPTAKE,ADDITION EXPERIMENTS,NITRATE REMOVAL,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,TRANSIENT STORAGE,UPTAKE KINETICS,NITROGEN UPTAKE,STABLE-ISOTOPE,ENERGY-FLOW,NITRIFICATION",,"Univ New Hampshire, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, Durham, NH 03824 USA"

It is realized that biological methodologies ought to be coordinated into urban arranging activities. Particularly in European cities, creating greenways and green corridors is a very recent phenomenon. The advancement of green space along urban waterways could moderate urban warmth island impacts, improve the physical and mental prosperity of city occupants, improve flood resilience and could also sustain biodiversity. The Pedieos River is the longest river in Cyprus. Like most of streams on the island, it is a non-enduring waterway, of fleeting nature that for the most part streams during the blustery winter months or after overwhelming precipitation occasions. A literature review was undertaken to discover the importance of rivers within the urbanized areas. It is known that the Pedieos River is firmly connected to the historical backdrop of Nicosia as it is one reason for the city's presence at the site.

37,37,"Peter, H",Jun 2014 ,Scales and drivers of temporal pCO(2) dynamics in an Alpine stream,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES,"The role of inland waters for the global carbon cycle is now recognized and evidence increasingly suggests that stream ecosystems disproportionately contribute to the carbon cycle. Understanding the dynamics and drivers of stream water partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 evasion fluxes from streams to the atmosphere is imperative for assessing the role of climate change on the carbon cycle in stream ecosystems. Monitoring pCO(2) over 3 years, we here report on the seasonal, diurnal, and event-driven dynamics of pCO(2) in the hyporheic zone and stream water of an Alpine stream and assess possible drivers of these dynamics. Our findings suggest that both catchment-derived CO2 delivered by shallow groundwater into the stream and in-stream respiration continuously build up pCO(2) in the hyporheic zone. Depending on stream water temperature and assumedly on primary production (inferred from photosynthetically active radiation), hyporheic CO2 contributes to stream water pCO(2) and ultimately to CO2 outgassing to the atmosphere. Diurnal patterns of stream water pCO(2) increasingly built up during extended base flow and streambed-scouring storms caused the collapse of these diurnal patterns. Post storm recovery of the diurnal pCO(2) patterns was generally rapid. Our findings suggest that decreasing gas exchange velocity related to receding discharge drives recovery dynamics. We found that average CO2 outgassing fluxes during night exceeded those during day by up to 1.8 times. Our study highlights temperature and hydrology-key components of climate change-as major drivers of pCO(2) dynamics in Alpine streams. They also underscore the necessity to consider day-night differences in CO2 outgassing fluxes to properly establish carbon budgets and regional estimates of CO2 outgassing to the atmosphere.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000340542300003,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DScales%2Band%2Bdrivers%2Bof%2Btemporal%2BpCO%25282%2529%2Bdynamics%2Bin%2Ban%2BAlpine%2Bstream%26rft.aufirst%3DHannes%26rft.auinit%3DH%26rft.aulast%3DPeter%26rft.date%3D2014%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2013JG002552%26rft.eissn%3D2169-8961%26rft.epage%3D1091%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D2169-8953%26rft.issue%3D6%26rft.jtitle%3DJOURNAL%2BOF%2BGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1078-1091%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1078%26rft.stitle%3DJ%2BGEOPHYS%2BRES-BIOGEO%26rft.volume%3D119%26rft.au%3DPeter%252C%2BH%26rft.au%3DSinger%252C%2BGA%26rft.au%3DBattin%252C%2BTJ&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=JOURNAL+OF+GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2013JG002552,,"ORGANIC-CARBON FLUXES,TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE,ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM,AQUATIC CONDUIT,DISSOLVED CO2,FLOW PATHS,DIOXIDE,RIVER,RESPIRATION,CLIMATE",,"Univ Vienna, Dept Limnol & Oceanog, Fac Life Sci, Vienna, Austria"

Empirical evidence showing the relationship between fractal bed topography and scaling of hyporheic travel times is still lacking. We performed experiments to make high-resolution observations of streambed topography and solute transport over naturally formed sand bedforms in a large laboratory flume. We analyzed the results using both numerical and theoretical models. We found that fractal properties of the bed topography do indeed affect solute residence time distributions. Overall, our experimental, numerical, and theoretical results provide evidence for a coupling between the sand-bed topography and the anomalous transport scaling in rivers. Larger bedforms induced greater hyporheic exchange and faster pore water turnover relative to smaller bedforms, suggesting that the structure of legacy morphology may be more important to solute and contaminant transport in streams and rivers than previously recognized.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000358691300029,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DFractal%2Bpatterns%2Bin%2Briverbed%2Bmorphology%2Bproduce%2Bfractal%2Bscaling%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bstorage%2Btimes%26rft.aufirst%3DA.%2BF.%26rft.auinit%3DAF%26rft.aulast%3DAubeneau%26rft.date%3D2015%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252F2015GL064155%26rft.eissn%3D1944-8007%26rft.epage%3D5315%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0094-8276%26rft.issue%3D13%26rft.jtitle%3DGEOPHYSICAL%2BRESEARCH%2BLETTERS%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D5309-5315%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D5309%26rft.stitle%3DGEOPHYS%2BRES%2BLETT%26rft.volume%3D42%26rft.au%3DAubeneau%252C%2BAF%26rft.au%3DMartin%252C%2BRL%26rft.au%3DPackman%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=GEOPHYSICAL+RESEARCH+LETTERS&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/2015GL064155,surface-groundwater interaction,"HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,STREAM CHEMISTRY,TRANSPORT,MODEL,TOPOGRAPHY,CATCHMENTS,RETENTION,EMISSIONS,DYNAMICS,NETWORK",,"Univ Notre Dame, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA"

We design two experimental groups and investigate the changes of potential and pressure during seepage of SRM (slightly clay materials) with different compactness and different concentration. The effects of the compaction degree and solution concentration on the streaming potential coupling coefficient and streaming potential were analyzed. The test results demonstrate that when the clay content in soil matrix is slight, the potential has a linear relationship with the hydraulic head difference, and seepage obeys Darcy's law. The surface conductivity is negligible at 0.01 M (1 M corresponds to a concentration of 58.4 g L-1) salinity, the compactness of the SRM decreases (the permeability coefficient increases), the apparent streaming potential coupling coefficient and pressure difference decrease is the reason streaming potential decreases. The permeability coefficient of the SRM is not affected by the change in salinity (0.0001-1 M) at 85% compactness, and its seepage characteristics are related to the mineral composition, morphology and the thickness of the bound water layer (electric double layer).

42,42,"Bellucci, CJ",Oct 2020 ,A novel method to evaluate stream connectivity using trail cameras,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Stream connectivity is important for the ecological health of the stream and downstream waters. In this study, we use the term stream connectivity to mean hydrologically connected pools and riffles that link stream habitat along a longitudinal continuum (upstream to downstream), while also recognizing the lateral dimension (connection to flood plain) and vertical connection to groundwater. There are thousands of man-made structures (i.e. dams, culverts, surface and groundwater withdrawal locations) in Connecticut which negatively impact stream connectivity and can result in aquatic habitat fragmentation. Cost-effective techniques are needed to assess human alteration to streams in order to prioritize management actions to restore stream connectivity. We developed a method to characterize stream connectivity using commercially available trail cameras that cost less than approximately $500 per deployment. We developed a six-category system to describe the variations in stream connectivity observed using the trail camera images. We then used the categorical data to calculate metrics that quantify stream connectivity. To pilot this approach, we evaluated reference locations with minimal anthropogenic influence on stream connectivity in comparison with stream reaches likely to be impacted by nearby groundwater wells. We found that metrics derived from trail camera images were useful to quantify stream connectivity. We anticipate that the methods outlined herein is a useful stream connectivity assessment tool that can be effectively communicated to scientists and non-scientists.

43,43,"Watson, JA",Apr 30 2018 ,The effects of floods on the temperature of riparian groundwater,HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"The transition area between rivers and their adjacent riparian aquifers, which may comprise the hyporheic zone, hosts important biochemical reactions, which control water quality. The rates of these reactions and metabolic processes are temperature dependent. Yet the thermal dynamics of riparian aquifers, especially during flooding and dynamic groundwater flow conditions, has seldom been studied. Thus, we investigated heat transport in riparian aquifers during 3 flood events of different magnitudes at 2 sites along the same river. River and riparian aquifer temperature and water-level data along the Lower Colorado River in Central Texas, USA, were monitored across 2-dimensional vertical sections perpendicular to the bank. At the downstream site, preflood temperature penetration distance into the bank suggested that advective heat transport from lateral hyporheic exchange of river water into the riparian aquifer was occurring during relatively steady low-flow river conditions. Although a small (20-cm stage increase) dam-controlled flood pulse had no observable influence on groundwater temperature, larger floods (40-cm and >3-m stage increases) caused lateral movement of distinct heat plumes away from the river during flood stage, which then retreated back towards the river after flood recession. These plumes result from advective heat transport caused by flood waters being forced into the riparian aquifer. These flood-induced temperature responses were controlled by the size of the flood, river water temperature during the flood, and local factors at the study sites, such as topography and local ambient water table configuration. For the intermediate and large floods, the thermal disturbance in the riparian aquifer lasted days after flood waters receded. Large floods therefore have impacts on the temperature regime of riparian aquifers lasting long beyond the flood's timescale. These persistent thermal disturbances may have a significant impact on biochemical reaction rates, nutrient cycling, and ecological niches in the river corridor.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000431002400012,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DThe%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bfloods%2Bon%2Bthe%2Btemperature%2Bof%2Briparian%2Bgroundwater%26rft.aufirst%3DJeffery%2BA.%26rft.auinit%3DJA%26rft.aulast%3DWatson%26rft.date%3D2018%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1002%252Fhyp.11504%26rft.eissn%3D1099-1085%26rft.epage%3D1281%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0885-6087%26rft.issue%3D9%26rft.jtitle%3DHYDROLOGICAL%2BPROCESSES%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D1267-1281%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D1267%26rft.stitle%3DHYDROL%2BPROCESS%26rft.volume%3D32%26rft.au%3DWatson%252C%2BJA%26rft.au%3DCardenas%252C%2BMB%26rft.au%3DNeilson%252C%2BBT&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=HYDROLOGICAL+PROCESSES&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1002/hyp.11504,"flood,groundwater,heat transport,hyporheic zone,riparian,temperature","HYPORHEIC ZONE,HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY,RESIDENCE TIMES,HEAT-TRANSPORT,STREAM,WATER,FLOW,DENITRIFICATION,HETEROGENEITY,EXCHANGE",,"Univ Texas Austin, Dept Geol Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA"
44,44,"Moon, YS",Mar 2009 ,Efficient stream subsequence matching algorithms for handheld devices on streaming time-series data,COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,"In recent years, the real-time processing of infinite online stream data is becoming a hot research issue. For the handheld devices dealing with the stream data, minimizing repetitive CPU operations such as multiplications is a major factor for their performances. In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for finding similar subsequences from streaming time-series data such as stock prices, network traffic data, exchange rates, and sensor network data. First, we formally define the problem of similar subsequence matching from streaming time-series data, which is called the strewn subsequence matching in this paper. Second, based on the window construction mechanism adopted by the previous subsequence matching algorithms in the non-streaming environment, we present an efficient window-based approach that minimizes CPU operations required for stream subsequence matching. Third, to make sure the window-based approach to be practical, we propose a notion of window MBR and present two stream subsequence matching algorithms based on the notion. Fourth, we formally prove correctness of the proposed algorithms. Finally, through a series of analyses and experiments, we show that our algorithms significantly outperform the naive algorithm. To our knowledge, there has been no algorithm to efficiently handle the stream subsequence matching problem except the naive one. Analysis results show that the numbers of multiplications of our algorithms are reduced by the factor of several hundreds than the naive one. Experiment results of measuring the elapsed execution times show that the performances of our algorithms are improved by up to several tens of times over the naive one. We believe that our window-based algorithms are excellent choices for embedded stream subsequence matching in handheld devices.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000277952000006,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DEfficient%2Bstream%2Bsubsequence%2Bmatching%2Balgorithms%2Bfor%2Bhandheld%2Bdevices%2Bon%2Bstreaming%2Btime-series%2Bdata%26rft.aufirst%3DYang-Sae%26rft.auinit%3DYS%26rft.aulast%3DMoon%26rft.date%3D2009%26rft.epage%3D127%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0267-6192%26rft.issue%3D2%26rft.jtitle%3DCOMPUTER%2BSYSTEMS%2BSCIENCE%2BAND%2BENGINEERING%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D115-127%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D115%26rft.stitle%3DCOMPUT%2BSYST%2BSCI%2BENG%26rft.volume%3D24%26rft.au%3DMoon%252C%2BYS%26rft.au%3DLoh%252C%2BWK&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=COMPUTER+SYSTEMS+SCIENCE+AND+ENGINEERING&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,,"streaming time-series data,stream subsequence matching,similar subsequence matching,handheld devices",SIMILARITY SEARCH,,"Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 192-1 Hyoja Dong, Chunchon 200701, Kangwon Do, South Korea"
45,45,"Weigelhofer, G",Jul 1 2018 ,Decoupled water-sediment interactions restrict the phosphorus buffer mechanism in agricultural streams,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Our study aimed to explore the effects of agriculture on the phosphorus buffer capacity of 11 headwater streams in Austria. We used phosphorus adsorption curves and re-suspension experiments to determine both, the potential of the sediments to act as phosphorus source or sink and the actual phosphorus exchange between water and sediments. Additionally, we determined the alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) in epilithic and epipsammic biofilms as indicator for the phosphorus demand of the benthic and hyporheic community. We hypothesized that highly polluted streams will show decreased phosphorus buffer capacities, which were either due to saturation or restricted water-sediment interactions.Our results support the second hypothesis. Fine sediment accumulations, organic matter content, and phosphorus concentrations in water and sediments increased with percent cropland in the catchment. Below SRP concentrations of 120 mu g L-1 in the stream water, sediments showed a high potential for phosphorus release, with zero equilibrium phosphorus concentrations (EPC0) being more than twice as high as SRP concentrations. Above 150 mu g L-1, EPC0 reached only 20-50% of SRP concentrations, indicating a high potential of the sediments to act as phosphorus sinks. These findings were confirmed by phosphorus uptake of these sediments during re-suspension. While APA in epilithic biofilms decreased with increasing SRP concentrations, APA in epipsammic biofilms showed the reverse pattern, indicating a restricted phosphorus supply of the hyporheic community despite phosphorus surplus in the water column.Our study shows that inputs of fine sediments from agricultural sources may reduce the phosphorus buffering mechanism of stream sediments through restrictions of water-sediment interactions. Consequently, water column and sediment processes are increasingly decoupled and phosphorus-rich stream water will not effectively reach the reactive sites in the sediments responsible for uptake. Therefore, phosphorus mitigation measures in stream ecosystems must comprise sediment management in the catchment as well as in-stream measures for the rehabilitation of the hyporheic zone.

46,46,"Riml, J",Jun 7 2011 ,Response functions for in-stream solute transport in river networks,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"This paper analyzes the effects of different hydrological mechanisms on the solute response in watershed stream networks. Important processes are due to the hydraulic and chemical retention of reactive solutes in transient storage zones and the cumulative consequences of these processes from a single transport pathway as well as from the network of transport pathways. Temporal moments are derived for a distributed stream network and for a compartment-in-series model. The temporal moments are evaluated and are utilized to derive formal expressions for translating the network parameters into compartmental model parameters. The analysis reveals that in addition to the hydraulic and chemical retention processes, the morphological and topological properties of a watershed have a distinct impact on the central temporal moments in terms of averaging of the solute load weighted distances as well as the transport parameters over the network. Kinetic (rate-limited) transient storage affects second-order and higher central temporal moments and thus has a secondary effect on the parameterization of compartmental models. Additional considerable contributions to all temporal moments are introduced when parameter variability along transport pathways is considered. The paper demonstrates an improved model outcome for phosphorus transport in a small Swedish watershed by accounting for the overall network effects when parameterizing a compartment-in-series model.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000291560500001,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.artnum%3DARTN%2BW06502%26rft.atitle%3DResponse%2Bfunctions%2Bfor%2Bin-stream%2Bsolute%2Btransport%2Bin%2Briver%2Bnetworks%26rft.aufirst%3DJoakim%26rft.auinit%3DJ%26rft.aulast%3DRiml%26rft.date%3D2011%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1029%252F2010WR009412%26rft.eissn%3D1944-7973%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0043-1397%26rft.jtitle%3DWATER%2BRESOURCES%2BRESEARCH%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.stitle%3DWATER%2BRESOUR%2BRES%26rft.volume%3D47%26rft.au%3DRiml%252C%2BJ%26rft.au%3DWorman%252C%2BA&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=WATER+RESOURCES+RESEARCH&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1029/2010WR009412,,"SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE,TRANSIENT STORAGE,HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE,LONGITUDINAL DISPERSION,COMPARTMENTAL-MODELS,ZONE,FLOW,CATCHMENT,SEDIMENT,CHANNEL",,"Royal Inst Technol, Div River Engn, Dept Land & Water Resources Engn, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden"
47,47,"Skokanova, H",May 2015 ,Potential influence of river engineering in two West Carpathian rivers on the conservation management of Calamagrostis pseudophragmites,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,"This article focuses on assessing the habitats characteristics of endangered Calamagrostis pseudophragmites in selected localities in the Czech Republic with different river engineering measures, which can potentially influence the occurrence of this species. Furthermore, we give some general recommendations for management practices based on our results to promote the conservation of Calamagrostis pseudophrag-mites.Our research shows that there is a high correlation between Calamagrostis pseudop hrag-mites and natural or near natural sunny biotopes on gravel bars or straight reaches near the water level that consist of nonsilted gravel substrates with a higher concentration of pebbles or cobbles, which are typical of piedmont and mountain-valley areas. Many of these areas are rapidly disappearing due to intensive anthropogenic pressure. We also found that Calamagrostis pseudophragmites is temporarily capable of surviving among other competitively stronger plant communities.To assess the potential influence of river engineering we selected two different types of rivers where this species is present - one was heavily altered by both the construction of a water reservoir in its upper reach and channelization of the stream, the other was less severely regulated by the construction of several weirs. Our results show differences in the occurrence of Calamagrostis pseudophrag-mites between the two rivers, being found at three times as many localities in the less regulated river than in the more regulated one. This corresponds with a higher number of gravel bars in the less regulated river.Based on our results, our general recommendations for the management of this species include only the partial removal of gravel bars (to ensure flood control in populated areas), blocking vegetation succession by removing woody vegetation and aggressive invasive species, the restoration of natural river dynamics, and connecting existing biotopes where this species is found.

48,48,"Collins, SF",Jan 2020 ,Reverberating effects of resource exchanges in stream-riparian food webs,OECOLOGIA,"Fluxes of materials or organisms across ecological boundaries, often termed ""resource subsidies,"" directly affect recipient food webs. Few studies have addressed how such direct responses in one ecosystem may, in turn, influence the fluxes of materials or organisms to other habitats or the potential for feedback relationships to occur among ecosystems. As part of a large-scale, multi-year experiment, we evaluated the hypothesis that the input of a marine-derived subsidy results in a complex array of resource exchanges (i.e., inputs, outputs, feedbacks) between stream and riparian ecosystems as responses disperse across ecological boundaries. Moreover, we evaluated how the physical properties of resource subsidies mediated complex responses by contrasting carcasses with a pelletized salmon treatment. We found that salmon carcasses altered stream-riparian food webs by directly subsidizing multiple aquatic and terrestrial organisms (e.g., benthic insect larvae, fishes, and terrestrial flies). Such responses further influenced food webs along indirect pathways, some of which spanned land and water (e.g., subsidized fishes reduced aquatic insect emergence, with consequences for spiders and bats). Subsidy-mediated feedbacks manifested when carcasses were removed to riparian habitats where they were colonized by carrion flies, some of which fell into the stream and acted as another prey subsidy for fishes. As the effects of salmon subsidies propagated through the stream-riparian food web, the sign of consumer responses was not always positive and appeared to be determined by the outcome of trophic interactions, such that localized trophic interactions within one ecosystem mediated the export of organisms to others.Show less",https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000516755800015,https://www.webofscience.com/api/gateway?GWVersion=2&SrcAuth=OpenURL&SrcApp=WOS&DestURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redi-bw.de%2Flinks%2Funist%3Furl_ver%3DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx%26rft.atitle%3DReverberating%2Beffects%2Bof%2Bresource%2Bexchanges%2Bin%2Bstream-riparian%2Bfood%2Bwebs%26rft.aufirst%3DScott%2BF.%26rft.auinit%3DSF%26rft.aulast%3DCollins%26rft.date%3D2020%26rft_id%3Dinfo%3Adoi%2F10.1007%252Fs00442-019-04574-y%26rft.eissn%3D1432-1939%26rft.epage%3D189%26rft.genre%3Darticle%26rft.issn%3D0029-8549%26rft.issue%3D1%26rft.jtitle%3DOECOLOGIA%26rft_val_fmt%3Dinfo%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal%26rft.pages%3D179-189%26rfr_id%3Dinfo%3Asid%2Fwebofscience.com%3AWOS%3AWOS%26rft.spage%3D179%26rft.stitle%3DOECOLOGIA%26rft.volume%3D192%26rft.au%3DCollins%252C%2BSF%26rft.au%3DBaxter%252C%2BCV%26rft.au%3DServheen%252C%2BG&DestApp=OTHER_OpenURL&SrcAppSID=EUW1ED0B4DWWxbBpFEuCk1hHwy3Or&SrcJTitle=OECOLOGIA&SrcPubType=MD_FORMAT,10.1007/s00442-019-04574-y,"Allochthonous resource,Donor control,Indirect effect,Pacific salmon,Tetragnathidae","LENGTH-MASS RELATIONSHIPS,PACIFIC SALMON,FRESH-WATER,TROPHIC CASCADES,META-ECOSYSTEMS,TERRESTRIAL,SUBSIDIES,PREDATION,PREY,LANDSCAPE",,"Idaho State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Stream Ecol Ctr, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA"
49,49,"Hayashi, M",Jul 11 2012 ,Diurnal fluctuations of electrical conductivity in a pre-alpine river: Effects of photosynthesis and groundwater exchange,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Diurnal fluctuations of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and pH due to photosynthesis and respiration are commonly observed in rivers that support periphyton growth. Diurnal fluctuations of electrical conductivity (EC) in connection with photosynthesis have also been reported, but mostly in small, first-order streams or in streams fed by karst springs. The objective of this study is to examine the diurnal EC fluctuations in a large river and understand biological, chemical, and hydrological processes controlling the fluctuations, using long-term archived data, focused field monitoring, and laboratory experiments. The study was conducted in the Thur River draining a 1700 km(2) catchment in northeastern Switzerland. The river showed distinct diurnal fluctuations of DO and pH caused by photosynthesis and respiration except during December and part of January. Fluctuations were frequently disrupted by spates with peak discharge exceeding 150 m(3) s(-1), which removed biofilm and periphyton. During a period of low flow (12 m(3) s(-1)) and clear sky, photosynthesis released O-2 and consumed CO2 in water during the daytime, thereby increasing pH and the saturation index of calcite. This caused calcite to precipitate and removed Ca and alkalinity from water, and reduced EC. Laboratory experiments showed that the increase in pH and the saturation index alone cannot cause calcite precipitation without the presence of periphyton. It is likely that the precipitation occurs in the microenvironment in the close vicinity of photosynthesizing cells, where the pH and the calcite saturation index are much higher than in the bulk river water. Calcite precipitation stopped during the nighttime despite supersaturated conditions, and EC gradually increased presumably due to the input of Ca and alkalinity by groundwater exchange. The study clearly showed that photosynthesis and calcite precipitation have a strong influence on the chemistry of the large river, and pointed out the need for future research examining the biogeochemical processes in the microenvironment surrounding periphyton, and the roles of river-groundwater exchange processes.
