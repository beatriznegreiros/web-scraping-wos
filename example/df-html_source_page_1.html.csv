0,Stream order and connectivity affect phosphorus distribution in plain river network,"Lyu, HH","The order and connectivity of streams influence phosphorus distribution extensively. In this work, the space-and-time variabilities of total phosphorus (TP), particulate phosphorus (PP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and dissolved unreactive phosphorus (DUP) in streams of three orders (?, ?, III) were analyzed during each spring of 2016-2018 in a plain river network area, China. The results show that: ? PP was the main form of TP and DRP was the main form of TDP. ? The average concentrations of phosphorus in the order ? streams were significant larger than those in the order III streams. ? The concentrations of TP, PP, TDP, and DRP in the poor-connected streams were considerably higher than those in the well-connected streams. Therefore, it is essential to implement effective practices to improve the protection and appropriate connectivity of small streams in plain river network areas.Show less"
1,"Effect of human activity intensity on stream structure and connectivity in Shaying River Basin, China","Luo, ZL","In order to quantify the relationship between human activity intensity and the evolution of stream structure and connectivity, the characteristics of spatial distribution and temporal evolution of stream structure and connectivity in different periods were studied by using river structure parameters and landscape ecology methods. The results indicate the following. (1) The mainstream trend of stream system, with the stream development coefficient decreased by 18.35% and 22.50% for the second- and third-level of stream, is obvious. (2) Human activity intensity has a significant impact on the change of stream structure and connectivity. Under the background of economy domination, the stronger human intervention is, the simpler streamstructure will be, and the poorer streamconnectivity will be. (3) From the view of time series, it is considered that human activities are the main reasons for affecting the change of stream structure and connectivity in the short term, while the natural factors have little effect. (4) The length of low-level streams is more affected by human activities than that of the high-level streams, but water surface ratio is opposite. This study can provide a reference for coordinating the contradiction between socio-economic development and protection of stream systems.Show less"
